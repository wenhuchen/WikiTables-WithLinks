  "/wiki/Herbaceous_plant": "Herbaceous plants in botany , frequently shortened to herbs , are vascular plants that have no persistent woody stems above ground . Herb has other meanings in cooking , medicine , and other fields . Herbaceous plants are those plants that do not have woody stems , they include many perennials , and nearly all annuals and biennials , they include both forbs and graminoids .

  "/wiki/Bamboo": "Bamboos /b\u00e6m\u02c8bu\u02d0/ ( listen ) are evergreen perennial flowering plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae . The word bamboo comes from the Dutch or Portuguese languages , which probably borrowed it from Malay . In bamboo , as in other grasses , the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross-section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement . The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent . The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots , including the palms and large bamboos , to be columnar rather than tapering . Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world , due to a unique rhizome-dependent system . Certain species of bamboo can grow 910 mm ( 36 in ) within a 24-hour period , at a rate of almost 40 mm ( 1.6 in ) an hour ( a growth around 1 mm every 90 seconds , or 1 inch every 40 minutes ) . Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family . Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South Asia , Southeast Asia and East Asia , being used for building materials , as a food source , and as a versatile raw product . Bamboo , like wood , is a natural composite material with a high strength-to-weight ratio useful for structures . Bamboo 's strength-to-weight ratio is similar to timber , and its strength is generally similar to a strong softwood or hardwood timber .",
  "/wiki/Imjin_War": "The Japanese invasions of Korea comprised two separate yet linked operations : an initial invasion in 1592 , a brief truce in 1596 , and a second invasion in 1597 . The conflict ended in 1598 with the withdrawal of the Japanese forces from the Korean Peninsula after a military stalemate in Korea 's southern coastal provinces . The invasions were launched by Toyotomi Hideyoshi with the intent of conquering the Korean Peninsula and China , which were respectively ruled by the Joseon and Ming dynasty . Japan quickly succeeded in occupying large portions of the Korean Peninsula , but the contribution of reinforcements by the Ming , as well as the disruption of Japanese supply fleets along the western and southern coasts by the Joseon Navy forced a withdrawal of Japanese forces from Pyongyang and the northern provinces to the south , in Busan and nearby southern regions . Afterwards , with guerrilla warfare waged against the Japanese by righteous armies ( Joseon civilian militias ) and supply difficulties hampering both sides , neither the Japanese nor the combined Ming and Joseon forces were able to mount a successful offensive or gain any additional territory , resulting in a military stalemate . The first phase of the invasion lasted from 1592 until 1596 , and was followed by ultimately unsuccessful peace negotiations between Japan and the Ming between 1596 and 1597 . In 1597 , Japan renewed its offensive by invading Korea a second time . The pattern of the second invasion largely mirrored that of the first . The Japanese had initial successes on land , capturing several cities and fortresses , only to be halted and forced to withdraw to the southern coastal regions of the peninsula . The pursuing Ming and Joseon forces , however , were unable to dislodge the Japanese from their remaining fortresses and entrenched positions in the southern coastal areas , where both sides again became locked in a ten-month long military stalemate . With Hideyoshi 's death in 1598 , limited progress on land , and continued disruption of supply lines by the Joseon navy , the Japanese forces in Korea were ordered to withdraw back to Japan by the new governing Council of Five Elders . Final peace negotiations between the parties followed afterwards and continued for several years , ultimately resulting in the normalization of relations .",

Joseon Korea came under the Japanese sphere of influence in the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876 and a complex coalition of the Meiji government , military , and business officials began a process of Korea 's political and economic integration into Japan . The Korean Empire became a protectorate of Japan in 1905 in the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905 and the country was indirectly ruled by the Japanese through the Resident-General of Korea . Japan formally annexed the Korean Empire in 1910 in the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910 , without the consent of Gojong , the regent of the Korean Emperor Sunjong . The Japanese Empire had established the Korean Peninsula as a colony of Japan administered by the General Government based in Keij\u014d ( Gyeongseong ) which governed Korea with near-absolute power . Japanese rule prioritized Korea 's Japanization , accelerating industrialization started by the Gwangmu Reform , building public works , and fighting the Korean independence movement . Japanese rule over Korea ended on 15 August 1945 upon the Surrender of Japan in World War II and the armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union occupied the territory .

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion .

For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

  "/wiki/Wisteria_floribunda": "Wisteria floribunda ( common name Japanese wisteria ) is a species of flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae , native to Japan . Growing to 9 m ( 30 ft ) , it is a woody , deciduous twining climber . It was brought from Japan to the United States in 1830 's . Since then , it has become one of the most highly romanticized flowering garden plants . It is also a common subject for bonsai , along with Wisteria sinensis ( Chinese wisteria ) . The flowering habit of Japanese wisteria is perhaps the most spectacular of the Wisteria genus . It sports the longest flower racemes of any wisteria ; they can reach nearly half a meter in length . These racemes burst into great trails of clustered white , pink , violet , or blue flowers in early- to mid-spring . The flowers carry a distinctive fragrance similar to that of grapes . The early flowering time of Japanese wisteria can cause problems in temperate climates , where early frosts can destroy the coming years ' flowers . It will also flower only after passing from juvenile to adult stage , a transition that may take many years just like its cousin Chinese wisteria . Japanese wisteria can grow over 30m long over many supports via powerful clockwise-twining stems .",
