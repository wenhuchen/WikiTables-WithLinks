  "/wiki/Leonis_Adobe": "The Leonis Adobe , built in 1844 , is one of the oldest surviving private residences in Los Angeles County and one of the oldest surviving buildings in the San Fernando Valley . Located in what is now Calabasas , California , the adobe was occupied by the wealthy rancher Miguel Leonis ( October 20 , 1824 - September 20 , 1889 ) until his death . Following Leonis ' death , the property was the subject of a legal dispute between his common law wife Espiritu Chijulla ( 1836 - May 10 , 1906 ) , heirs , and a daughter born out of wedlock ; the dispute lasted more than 15 years in the courts . In 1961 , the adobe had fallen victim to vandalism , and its owner applied for a permit to raze the structure and erect a supermarket in its place . Preservationists succeeded in having the adobe declared Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument # 1 in 1962 , saving it from the wrecking ball at the last minute . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 . According to legend , the Leonis Adobe is haunted , and was featured in the British paranormal television series Most Haunted in 2005 . The adobe was restored and is operated as a living museum .",

  "/wiki/Bolton_Hall_(California)": "In the early 1900s , the area now known as Tujunga was undeveloped land , the former Rancho Tujunga . In 1913 , William Ellsworth Smythe , working alongside M.V . Hartranft ( they had purchased the land together ) , formed a utopian community called Los Terrenitos - Spanish for The Little Lands . Smythe was the leader of the Utopian Little Landers movement and had already established colonies in Idaho and San Ysidro , California . He advocated the principle that families settling on an acre or two of land could support themselves and create a flourishing community . [ citation needed ] Town lots in Tujunga were sold to settlers at $ 800 for an acre of land and a life of independence . Bolton Hall was built in 1913 by George Harris , a self-described nature builder , rock mason , and stone sculptor . He first named it Bolton Hall Hall , after Bolton Hall ( 1854-1938 ) , a New York City progressive activist and proponent of the back-to-the-land movement . :38 Harris urged that the 3,000-square-foot ( 280 m2 ) hall be built solely of native materials and selected a design that he said borrowed nothing from European architecture . Harris and the Terrenitos community built the hall using granite chunks and stones from nearby fields and hillsides and from the Tujunga Wash. Stones were placed in position in the structure based on the positions in which they settled after falling from a cliff .

[ b ] Along with the neighboring Chumash , the Tongva were the most powerful indigenous people to inhabit Southern California . At the time of European contact , they may have numbered 5,000 to 10,000 . Many lines of evidence suggest that the Tongva are descended from Uto-Aztecan-speaking peoples who originated in what is now Nevada and moved southwest into coastal Southern California 3,500 years ago . These migrants either absorbed or pushed out the Hokan-speaking peoples in the region . By 500 AD , the Tongva had come to occupy all the lands now associated with them . A hunter-gatherer society , the Tongva traded widely with neighboring peoples . Over time , scattered communities came to speak distinct dialects of the Tongva language , part of the Takic subgroup of the Uto-Aztecan language family .

  "/wiki/Los_Angeles_River": "The Los Angeles River is a major river in Los Angeles County , California .

While the river was once free-flowing and frequently flooding , forming alluvial flood plains along its banks , it is currently notable for flowing through a concrete channel on a fixed course , which was built after a series of devastating floods in the early 20th century . Before the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct , the river was the primary source of fresh water for the city . Although the Los Angeles region still receives some water from the river and other local sources , most of the water supply flows from several aqueducts serving the area . The Los Angeles River is heavily polluted from agricultural and urban runoff . Fed primarily by rainwater and snowmelt ( in winter and spring ) , the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys ( in summer and fall ) , and urban discharge , it is one of the few low-elevation perennial rivers in Southern California . Some water usually reaches the sea , even in the driest summers ; although there are historical accounts of the river running dry , there has been constant flow of the river every month since recording of stream flow began in 1929 . This is helped by the concrete channel , which limits absorption of water into the earth . Flow , while generally low in volume , can be extremely brisk even in summer .",
