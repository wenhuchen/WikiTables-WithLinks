Baiheliang has been submerged to a depth of over 30 metres behind the Three Gorges Dam . Engraved in the rock are 163 inscriptions and pictures , which include 114 hydrological annotations , which give detailed records of water levels in the river over 1,200 years , since the first year of the Tang dynasty Guangde era , 763 ; the assembled inscriptions and fish carvings , taken together , formed the longest such sequence in the world . One fish carving originally carved in the Tang dynasty was re-carved at a moment of lowest water in 1685 : modern measurements recorded the elevation of their eyes , 137.91 metres , almost the same as that of the zero point of the modern water level gauge . The fish carvings and hydrological inscriptions were virtually unknown in the West until the 1970s , when Chinese experts presented photos of these two fish and hydrological data of Fuling for the past 1,200 years at an international hydrological symposium held in the UK .
