In the trilogy , Hill Valley is seen in four different time periods ( 1885 , 1955 , 1985 and 2015 ) as well as in a dystopian alternate 1985 . The films contain many sight gags , verbal innuendos and detailed set design elements , from which a detailed and consistent history of the area can be derived . The name Hill Valley is itself a joke , being an oxymoron . However , an early script for Back to the Future Part II mentioned that Hill Valley was named after its founder , William Bill Hill",
