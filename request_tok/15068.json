  "/wiki/Public_Works_Administration": "Public Works Administration ( PWA ) , part of the New Deal of 1933 , was a large-scale public works construction agency in the United States headed by Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes . It was created by the National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933 in response to the Great Depression . It built large-scale public works such as dams , bridges , hospitals , and schools . Its goals were to spend $ 3.3 billion in the first year , and $ 6 billion in all , to provide employment , stabilize purchasing power , and help revive the economy . Most of the spending came in two waves in 1933-35 , and again in 1938 . Originally called the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works , it was renamed the Public Works Administration in 1935 and shut down in 1944 . The PWA spent over $ 7 billion in contracts to private construction firms that did the actual work . It created an infrastructure that generated national and local pride in the 1930s and remains vital eight decades later . The PWA was much less controversial than its rival agency with a confusingly similar name , the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) , headed by Harry Hopkins , which focused on smaller projects and hired unemployed unskilled workers .",

  "/wiki/Gold_rush": "A gold rush or gold fever is a new discovery of gold - sometimes accompanied by other precious metals and rare-earth minerals - that brings an onrush of miners seeking their fortune . Major gold rushes took place in the 19th century in Australia , New Zealand , Brazil , Canada , South Africa and the United States , while smaller gold rushes took place elsewhere . In the 19th century the wealth that resulted was distributed widely because of reduced migration costs and low barriers to entry . While gold mining itself proved unprofitable for most diggers and mine-owners , some people made large fortunes , and merchants and transportation facilities made large profits . The resulting increase in the world 's gold supply stimulated global trade and investment . Historians have written extensively about the mass migration , trade , colonization and environmental history associated with gold rushes . Gold rushes were typically marked by a general buoyant feeling of a free-for-all in income mobility , in which any single individual might become abundantly wealthy almost instantly , as expressed in the California Dream . Gold rushes helped spur waves of immigration that often led to permanent settlement of new regions . Activities propelled by gold rushes define significant aspects of the culture of the Australian and North American frontiers . At a time when the world 's money supply was based on gold , the newly-mined gold provided economic stimulus far beyond the gold fields , feeding into local and wider economic booms . Gold rushes occurred as early as the times of the Roman Empire , whose gold mining was described by Diodorus Siculus and Pliny the Elder , and probably further back to ancient Egypt .",
  "/wiki/Grand_Mound_(Minnesota)": "Grand Mound is a prehistoric burial site in Koochiching County , Minnesota , United States . It is the largest surviving prehistoric structure in the upper Midwest , dating back to 200 BCE . The site was listed as a National Historic Landmark on June 23 , 2011 . The main burial mound measures 140 feet ( 43 m ) in length and 100 feet ( 30 m ) in width , about 25 feet ( 7.6 m ) high , plus a 200 feet ( 61 m ) tail measuring 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) in width and 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) in height . There are four other smaller earthworks at the site , closer in size to typical burial mounds around the Midwest . Besides the mound , the site contains a number of stratified deposits from villages dating to the Middle Woodland and Late Woodland periods . The main mound was for many years thought to be typical conical mound , but in the 21st century it was discovered to have a tail , and has been reclassified as an effigy mound , possibly resembling a muskrat . The mound is part of a larger series of interconnected archaeological sites that include seasonal camp locations and fishing areas . The site once had a visitor center operated by the Minnesota Historical Society , opened in 1975 . The visitor center was closed in 2003 and the site was closed to the public in 2007 , amid concerns that having tourists viewing burial sites was inappropriate . Bill Keyes , the head of the Historical Society 's historic sites and museums division , said , What we heard from tribal elders was that this was like a cemetery , it was a burial ground , and that operating it as a tourist attraction was really not an appropriate way to go .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture ( sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance ) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes . Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take .",

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

  "/wiki/Petroglyph": "A petroglyph is an image created by removing part of a rock surface by incising , picking , carving , or abrading , as a form of rock art . Outside North America , scholars often use terms such as carving , engraving , or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images . Petroglyphs are found worldwide , and are often associated with prehistoric peoples . The word comes from the Greek prefix petro- , from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 petra meaning stone , and \u03b3\u03bb\u03cd\u03c6\u03c9 gl\u00fdph\u014d meaning carve , and was originally coined in French as p\u00e9troglyphe . Another form of petroglyph , normally found in literate cultures , a rock relief or rock-cut relief is a relief sculpture carved on living rock such as a cliff , rather than a detached piece of stone . While these relief carvings are a category of rock art , sometimes found in conjunction with rock-cut architecture , they tend to be omitted in most works on rock art , which concentrate on engravings and paintings by prehistoric or nonliterate cultures . Some of these reliefs exploit the rock 's natural properties to define an image . Rock reliefs have been made in many cultures , especially in the ancient Near East . Rock reliefs are generally fairly large , as they need to be to make an impact in the open air . Most have figures that are larger than life-size . Stylistically , a culture 's rock relief carvings relate to other types of sculpture from period concerned . Except for Hittite and Persian examples , they are generally discussed as part of the culture 's sculptural practice .",
  "/wiki/Ernest_Oberholtzer": "Ernest Carl Oberholtzer ( February 6 , 1884 - June 6 , 1977 ) was an American explorer , author , and conservationist . Nicknamed Ober , he was born and raised in Davenport , Iowa , but he lived most of his adult life in Minnesota . Oberholtzer attended Harvard University and received a bachelor of arts degree , but left after one year of graduate study in landscape architecture . He made his first trip to the Minnesota-Ontario border lakes in 1906 . In 1909 he took his first extended canoe voyage through the border lakes and the Rainy Lake watershed , traveling 3,000 miles that summer . During the period from 1908 to 1915 , Oberholtzer wrote a number of articles and short stories , some under the penname Ernest Carliowa . Many of the stories and articles were based on his canoe trip experiences . In 1913 , Oberholtzer moved to Rainy Lake . He purchased Mallard Island in 1922 ; the tiny island would be his home for more than 50 years . After plans were announced by business mogul Edward Backus to construct a series of dams to harness the Rainy Lake watershed for power generation , Oberholtzer spoke in opposition at a hearing of the International Joint Commission held at International Falls in September 1925 . As a result of meetings with Minneapolis businessmen who were similarly opposed to industrialization of the area , the Quetico-Superior Council was formed in 1928 . Oberholtzer served as its first president .",

  "/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration": "The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration ) was an American New Deal agency , employing millions of job-seekers ( mostly unskilled men ) to carry out public works projects , including the construction of public buildings and roads . It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing . The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority , which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power .",
