  "/wiki/Dorset": "Dorset ( /\u02c8d\u0254\u02d0rs\u026at/ ; archaically : Dorsetshire ) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast . The ceremonial county comprises the unitary authority areas of Bournemouth , Christchurch and Poole and Dorset . Covering an area of 2,653 square kilometres ( 1,024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north-west , Wiltshire to the north-east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south . After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county 's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points . The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics , and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing , Cornish pilot gig rowing , sea kayaking and powerboating .",
  "/wiki/Country_house": "An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside . Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house . This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city - hence , for these people , the term distinguished between town and country . However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive . While a ch\u00e2teau or a Schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building , a country house , similar to an Ansitz , is usually unfortified . If fortified , it is called a castle , but not all buildings with the name castle are fortified ( for example Highclere Castle ) .",

The Vorontsov Palace is one of the oldest and largest palaces in Crimea , and is one of the most popular tourist attractions on Crimea 's southern coast . The palace was built between 1828 and 1848 for Russian Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov for use as his personal summer residence at a cost of 9 million silver rubles . It was designed in a loose interpretation of the English Renaissance revival style by English architect Edward Blore and his assistant William Hunt . The building is a hybrid of several architectural styles , but faithful to none . Among those styles are elements of Scottish Baronial , Indo-Saracenic Revival Architecture , and Gothic Revival architecture . Blore had designed many buildings in the United Kingdom , and was later particularly well known there for completing the design of Buckingham Palace in London . Once completed , the palace was visited by many members of the Russian Empire 's elite ruling class ; a great number of these vastly wealthy nobles were so taken with the palace and its seaboard site that they were moved to create their own summer retreats in the Crimea . By the early 20th century not only many aristocrats , but also members of the Imperial Family , including the Tsar himself , had palaces in an assortment of architectural styles in the vicinity . An important feature of the Vorontsov Palace is the adjoining park ensemble , which features 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) of greenery and forestry arranged by German landscape gardener Carolus Keebach . Today , the Vorontsov Palace is a part of the Alupka Palace-Park Complex , a national historical preserve including the Massandra Palace in neighbouring Massandra . Owing to its status as an important local tourist attraction and architectural monument , the Vorontsov Palace and its surrounding park complex were frequently featured in Ukrainian and Soviet cinema productions such as : An Ordinary Miracle ( 1964 ) , Nebesnye lastochki ( 1976 ) , Crazy Day or The Marriage of Figaro ( 2004 ) , and Sappho ( 2008 ) .",

Across the Black Sea to its west is Romania and to its south Turkey . Crimea ( or Tauric Peninsula , as it was called from antiquity until the early modern period ) has historically been at the boundary between the classical world and the Pontic-Caspian steppe . Its southern fringe was colonised by the Greeks , the Persians , the Romans , the Byzantine Empire , the Crimean Goths , the Genoese and the Ottoman Empire , while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading steppe nomads and empires , such as the Cimmerians , Scythians , Sarmatians , Goths , Alans , Bulgars , Huns , Khazars , Kipchaks , Mongols and the Golden Horde . Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the Crimean Khanate during the 15th to 18th century . In 1783 , Crimea was annexed by the Russian Empire as the result of the Russo-Turkish War ( 1768-1774 ) . Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 , Crimea became an autonomous republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in the USSR . During World War II , Crimea was downgraded to the Crimean Oblast after its entire indigenous population , the Crimean Tatars , were deported to Central Asia , an act recognized as a genocide . In 1954 , it was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR from the Russian SFSR . With the collapse of the Soviet Union , Ukraine was reestablished as an independent state in 1991 , and most of the peninsula was reorganized as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea , while the city of Sevastopol retained its special status within Ukraine .",

In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops . At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral , the Pope , or the King of England .

Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn ( the fourth son of King George III ) , and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld . After both the Duke and his father died in 1820 , she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller , John Conroy . She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father 's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue . The United Kingdom was an established constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power . Privately , she attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments ; publicly , she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality . Victoria married her cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840 . Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent , earning Victoria the sobriquet the grandmother of Europe and spreading haemophilia in European royalty . After Albert 's death in 1861 , Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances .",

  "/wiki/Vale_Royal_Abbey": "Vale Royal Abbey is a former medieval abbey and later country house in Whitegate England . The precise location and boundaries of the abbey are difficult to determine in today 's landscape . The original building was founded c. 1270 by the Lord Edward , later Edward I for Cistercian monks . Edward had supposedly taken a vow during a rough sea crossing in the 1260s . Civil wars and political upheaval delayed the build until 1272 , the year he inherited the throne . The original site at Darnhall was unsatisfactory , so was moved a few miles north to the Delamere Forest . Edward intended the structure to be on a grand scale - had it been completed it would have been the largest Cistercian monastery in the country - but his ambitions were frustrated by recurring financial difficulties . Early during construction , England became involved in war with Wales . As the treasury was thus in need of resources , Vale Royal lost all of its grants , skilled masons and builders . When work resumed in the late 14th century , the building was considerably smaller than originally planned . The project encountered other problems . The abbey was mismanaged and poor relations with the local population sparked outbreaks of violence on a number of occasions .",

In 1529 , as Wolsey fell from favour , the cardinal gave the palace to the King to check his disgrace ; Henry VIII later enlarged it . Along with St James ' Palace , it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many the King owned . The palace is currently in the possession of Queen Elizabeth II and the Crown . In the following century , King William III 's massive rebuilding and expansion work , which was intended to rival the Palace of Versailles , destroyed much of the Tudor palace . His work ceased in 1694 , leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles , domestic Tudor and Baroque . While the palace 's styles are an accident of fate , a unity exists due to the use of pink bricks and a symmetrical , if vague , balancing of successive low wings . King George II was the last monarch to reside in the palace .
