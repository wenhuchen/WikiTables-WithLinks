  "/wiki/Francqui_Prize": "The Francqui Prize is a prestigious Belgian scholarly and scientific prize named after \u00c9mile Francqui . Normally annually since 1933 , the Francqui Foundation awards it in recognition of the achievements of a scholar or scientist , who at the start of the year still had to be under 50 . It currently represents a sum of 250,000 Euros and is awarded in the following three-year rotation of subjects : exact sciences , social sciences or humanities , and biological or medical sciences . Proposed candidates must be associated with a Belgian academic institution , in the case of a foreigner for at least ten years . The recipient is selected by a jury of eight to 14 members , none of whom may be associated with a Belgian institution . The members of the international jury vote by secret letter , and the laureate they recommend must be supported by two thirds of the assembled directors of the foundation ( with a quorum of 12 ) or no prize would be awarded that year . The prize is meant to encourage the further work of the young laureate , rather than crown the latter 's career . He or she is also asked to organise an international colloquium in the appropriate discipline the same year that he is awarded the prize , which usually leads to an international publication which enables the quality of Belgian university research to be more widely appreciated .",

  "/wiki/Nobel_prize": "The Nobel Prize ( /\u02c8no\u028ab\u025bl/ , NOH-bel ; Swedish : Nobelpriset , [ n\u028a\u02c8b\u025b\u0302l\u02d0\u02ccpri\u02d0s\u025bt ] ; Norwegian : Nobelprisen ) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic , cultural , or scientific advances . The will of the Swedish chemist , engineer and industrialist Alfred Nobel established the five Nobel prizes in 1895 . The prizes in Chemistry , Literature , Peace , Physics , and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901 . The prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards available in their respective fields . In 1968 , Sveriges Riksbank , Sweden 's central bank , established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel . The award is based on a donation received by the Nobel Foundation in 1968 from Sveriges Riksbank on the occasion of the bank 's 300th anniversary . The first Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen in 1969 . The Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , Stockholm , Sweden , according to the same principles as for the Nobel Prizes that have been awarded since 1901 . The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Chemistry , the Nobel Prize in Physics , and the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ; the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ; the Swedish Academy grants the Nobel Prize in Literature ; and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Nobel Peace Prize . Between 1901 and 2018 , the Nobel Prizes ( and the Prizes in Economic Sciences , from 1969 on ) were awarded 590 times to 935 people and organizations . With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once , this makes a total of 27 organizations and 908 individuals . The prize ceremonies take place annually in Stockholm , Sweden ( with the exception of the Peace Prize ceremony , which is held in Oslo , Norway ) .",
  "/wiki/Atmospheric_chemist": "Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science in which the chemistry of the Earth 's atmosphere and that of other planets is studied . It is a multidisciplinary approach of research and draws on environmental chemistry , physics , meteorology , computer modeling , oceanography , geology and volcanology and other disciplines . Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as climatology . The composition and chemistry of the Earth 's atmosphere is of importance for several reasons , but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms . The composition of the Earth 's atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as volcano emissions , lightning and bombardment by solar particles from corona . It has also been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health , crops and ecosystems . Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include acid rain , ozone depletion , photochemical smog , greenhouse gases and global warming . Atmospheric chemists seek to understand the causes of these problems , and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them , allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated .",

  "/wiki/Nonlinear_dynamics": "In mathematics and science , a nonlinear system is a system in which the change of the output is not proportional to the change of the input . Nonlinear problems are of interest to engineers , biologists , physicists , mathematicians , and many other scientists because most systems are inherently nonlinear in nature . Nonlinear dynamical systems , describing changes in variables over time , may appear chaotic , unpredictable , or counterintuitive , contrasting with much simpler linear systems . Typically , the behavior of a nonlinear system is described in mathematics by a nonlinear system of equations , which is a set of simultaneous equations in which the unknowns ( or the unknown functions in the case of differential equations ) appear as variables of a polynomial of degree higher than one or in the argument of a function which is not a polynomial of degree one . In other words , in a nonlinear system of equations , the equation ( s ) to be solved can not be written as a linear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in them . Systems can be defined as nonlinear , regardless of whether known linear functions appear in the equations . In particular , a differential equation is linear if it is linear in terms of the unknown function and its derivatives , even if nonlinear in terms of the other variables appearing in it . As nonlinear dynamical equations are difficult to solve , nonlinear systems are commonly approximated by linear equations ( linearization ) . This works well up to some accuracy and some range for the input values , but some interesting phenomena such as solitons , chaos , and singularities are hidden by linearization . It follows that some aspects of the dynamic behavior of a nonlinear system can appear to be counterintuitive , unpredictable or even chaotic . Although such chaotic behavior may resemble random behavior , it is in fact not random . For example , some aspects of the weather are seen to be chaotic , where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout .",
  "/wiki/Stochastic_dynamics": "In probability theory and related fields , a stochastic or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a family of random variables . Historically , the random variables were associated with or indexed by a set of numbers , usually viewed as points in time , giving the interpretation of a stochastic process representing numerical values of some system randomly changing over time , such as the growth of a bacterial population , an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise , or the movement of a gas molecule . Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner . They have applications in many disciplines including sciences such as biology , chemistry , ecology , neuroscience , and physics as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing , signal processing , information theory , computer science , cryptography and telecommunications . Furthermore , seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance . Applications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes . Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process , [ a ] used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse , and the Poisson process , used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time . These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes , and were discovered repeatedly and independently , both before and after Bachelier and Erlang , in different settings and countries . The term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process , because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space . The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably , often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables . But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line . If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space , then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead .",
  "/wiki/Quantum_chaos": "Quantum chaos is a branch of physics which studies how chaotic classical dynamical systems can be described in terms of quantum theory . The primary question that quantum chaos seeks to answer is : What is the relationship between quantum mechanics and classical chaos ? The correspondence principle states that classical mechanics is the classical limit of quantum mechanics , specifically in the limit as the ratio of Planck 's constant to the action of the system tends to zero . If this is true , then there must be quantum mechanisms underlying classical chaos ( although this may not be a fruitful way of examining classical chaos ) . If quantum mechanics does not demonstrate an exponential sensitivity to initial conditions , how can exponential sensitivity to initial conditions arise in classical chaos , which must be the correspondence principle limit of quantum mechanics ? In seeking to address the basic question of quantum chaos , several approaches have been employed :",

  "/wiki/David_Finkelstein": "David Ritz Finkelstein ( July 19 , 1929 - January 24 , 2016 ) was an emeritus professor of physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology . Born in New York City , Finkelstein obtained his Ph.D. in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1953 and taught at Stevens Institute of Technology through 1960 , while he also held a Ford Foundation Fellowship at the European Organization for Nuclear Research from 1959-1960 . From 1964 to 1976 , he was professor of physics at Yeshiva University . He became a member of the faculty at Georgia Tech in 1980 . In 1958 , Finkelstein and Charles W. Misner found the gravitational kink , a topological defect in the gravitational metric , whose quantum theory could exhibit spin 1/2 . The simplest kink exhibited an easily understood event horizon that led him to recognize the one in the Schwarzschild metric and eliminate its coordinate singularity . In essence , Finkelstein determined that whatever falls past the Schwarzschild radius into a black hole can not escape it ; the membrane is one-directional . This important work influenced the decisions of Roger Penrose and John Archibald Wheeler to accept the physical existence of event horizons and black holes . Most of Finkelstein 's work is directed toward a quantum theory of space-time structure . He early on accepted the conclusion of John von Neumann that anomalies of quantum mechanical measurement are anomalies of the logic of quantum mechanical systems . Therefore , he formed quantum analogues of set theory , the standard language for classical space-time structures , and proposed that space-time is a quantum set of space-time quanta dubbed chronons , a form of quantum computer with spins for quantum bits , as a quantum version of the cellular automaton of von Neumann . His early quantum space-times proving unphysical , he later studied chronons with a regularized form of Bose-Einstein statistics due to Tchavdar D. Palev .",
