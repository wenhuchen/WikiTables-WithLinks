  "/wiki/Madonna:_Truth_or_Dare": "Madonna : Truth or Dare ( known simply as Truth or Dare and In Bed with Madonna outside of North America ) is a 1991 American documentary film by director Alek Keshishian chronicling the life of singer and songwriter Madonna during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour . Madonna approached Keshishian to do an HBO special on the tour after watching his Harvard senior project . Initially planned to be a traditional concert film , Keshishian was so impressed with the backstage life that he persuaded Madonna to do an actual film focusing on that . Madonna funded the project and served as its executive producer . The film was shot in black-and-white , in order to emulate cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 , while the performance scenes were shot in color . It was screened out of competition at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival and was given a limited release on May 10 , 1991 ; two weeks later , it had its worldwide release . It opened to positive reviews , although certain parts and scenes were criticized . It was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actress for Madonna as herself . With a worldwide gross of $ 29,012,935 ( an estimated $ 54.44 million in 2019 dollars ) , it remained the highest-grossing documentary of all time , until Bowling for Columbine surpassed it in 2002 . Truth or Dare has been noted as a groundbreaking film for its casual portrayal of homosexuality , and was compared to the documentary Paris Is Burning ( 1990 ) . It has also left its mark on reality television and celebrity culture , inspiring parodies and other music-related documentaries .",

  "/wiki/Man_of_Aran": "Man of Aran is a 1934 Irish fictional documentary ( ethnofiction ) film shot , written and directed by Robert J. Flaherty about life on the Aran Islands off the western coast of Ireland . It portrays characters living in premodern conditions , documenting their daily routines such as fishing off high cliffs , farming potatoes where there is little soil , and hunting for huge basking sharks to get liver oil for lamps . Some situations are fabricated , such as one scene in which the shark fishermen are almost lost at sea in a sudden gale . Additionally , the family members shown are not actually related , having been chosen from among the islanders for their photogenic qualities . George Stoney 's 1978 documentary How the Myth was Made , which is included in the special features of the DVD , relates that the Aran Islanders had not hunted sharks in this way for over fifty years at the time the film was made . Man of Aran is Flaherty 's recreation of culture on the edges of modern society , even though much of the primitive life depicted had been left behind by the 1930s . It is impressive , however , for its drama , for its spectacular cinematography of landscape and seascape , and for its concise editing .",
