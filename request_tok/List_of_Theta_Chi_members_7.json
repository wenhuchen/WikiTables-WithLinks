The first event was held in 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver , Colorado . The purpose of the early Ultimate Fighting Championship competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of different fighting disciplines like boxing , kickboxing , Brazilian jiu-jitsu , sambo , wrestling , Muay Thai , karate , and judo . In subsequent events , fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline , which indirectly helped create a separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts . In 2016 , UFC 's parent company , Zuffa , was sold to a group led by William Morris Endeavor ( WME-IMG ) , including Silver Lake Partners , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital for US $ 4.025 billion . With a TV deal and expansion in Australia , Asia , Europe , and new markets within the United States , the UFC has increased in popularity , and has achieved greater mainstream media coverage ; the promotion brought in a total revenue of US $ 609 million in 2015 , and its next domestic media rights agreement with ESPN was valued at $ 1.5 billion over a five-year term .",

  "/wiki/High_jump": "The high jump is a track and field event in which competitors must jump unaided over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without dislodging it . In its modern most practiced format , a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing . In the modern era , athletes run towards the bar and use the Fosbury Flop method of jumping , leaping head first with their back to the bar . Since ancient times , competitors have introduced increasingly effective techniques to arrive at the current form . The discipline is , alongside the pole vault , one of two vertical clearance events to feature on the Olympic athletics programme . It is contested at the World Championships in Athletics and IAAF World Indoor Championships , and is a common occurrence at track and field meetings . The high jump was among the first events deemed acceptable for women , having been held at the 1928 Olympic Games .

Over the next few years , the flop became the dominant style of the event and remains so today . Before Fosbury , most elite jumpers used the straddle technique , Western Roll , Eastern cut-off or scissors jump to clear the bar . Given that landing surfaces had previously been sandpits or low piles of matting , high jumpers of earlier years had to land on their feet or at least land carefully to prevent injury . With the advent of deep foam matting high jumpers were able to be more adventurous in their landing styles and hence experiment with styles of jumping .",

Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 .

Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States .
