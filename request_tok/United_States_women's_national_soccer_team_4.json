It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic . To its south-west lies the small island of Navassa Island , which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration . Haiti is 27,750 square kilometers ( 10,714 sq mi ) in size and has an estimated population of 11.1 million , making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Cuba . The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , who migrated from South America . The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue . French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations , worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa , which made the colony one of the richest in the world . In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789-99 ) , slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture . After 12 years of conflict , Napoleon Bonaparte 's forces were defeated by Louverture 's successor , Jean-Jacques Dessalines ( later Emperor Jacques I ) , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty on 1 January 1804 - the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the first country to abolish slavery , and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt .",
