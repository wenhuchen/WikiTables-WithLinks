[ note 2 ] The sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island is a dependent territory and thus not considered part of the kingdom . Norway also lays claim to the Antarctic territories of Queen Maud Land and Peter I Island . Norway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres ( 148,729 sq mi ) and a population of 5,312,300 ( as of August 2018 ) .

Norway is bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east , and the Skagerrak strait to the south , with Denmark on the other side . Norway has an extensive coastline , facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea . The maritime influence also dominates Norway 's climate with mild lowland temperatures on the sea coasts , whereas the interior , while colder , is also a lot milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes . Even during polar night in the north , temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the coastline . The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country .

  "/wiki/Monarchy_of_Norway": "The Norwegian monarch is the monarchical head of state of Norway , which is a constitutional and hereditary monarchy with a parliamentary system . The Norwegian monarchy can trace its line back to the reign of Harald Fairhair and the previous petty kingdoms which were united to form Norway ; it has been in unions with both Sweden and Denmark for long periods . The present monarch is King Harald V , who has reigned since 17 January 1991 , succeeding his father , Olav V. The heir apparent is his only son , Crown Prince Haakon . The crown prince undertakes various public ceremonial functions , as does the king 's wife , Queen Sonja . The crown prince also acts as regent in the king 's absence . There are several other members of the Royal Family , including the king 's daughter , grandchildren and sister . Since the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden and the subsequent election of a Danish prince as King Haakon VII in 1905 , the reigning royal house of Norway has been a branch of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg branch of the House of Oldenburg ; originally from Schleswig-Holstein in Germany , the same royal house as the Danish and former Greek royal families . Whilst the Constitution of Norway grants important executive powers to the King , these are almost always exercised by the Council of State in the name of the King ( King 's Council , or cabinet ) . Formally the King appoints the government according to his own judgement , but parliamentary practice has been in place since 1884 . Constitutional practice has replaced the meaning of the word King in most articles of the constitution from the king personally to the elected government . The powers vested in the monarch are significant , but are treated only as reserve powers and as an important security part of the role of the monarchy . The King does not , by convention , have direct participation in government .",

Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century .

Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century .
