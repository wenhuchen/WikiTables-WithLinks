After studying and graduating in his home town of Padua , he went to Venice , where he devoted himself to writing comedies and farces , as well as both humorous and serious text for major opera composers of the time . He was an active libretto from 1789 to 1816 . It also produced texts for cantatas , oratorios , dramas and sacred compositions . Unlike most of his contemporaries , Sografi called his funny booklets comedies , rather playful dramas ; this because he followed the style of the character comedies of Goldoni and refused the too obvious comedy of art comedies . He died in Padua .",

  "/wiki/Com\u00e9die-Italienne": "Com\u00e9die-Italienne or Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien are French names which have been used to refer to Italian-language theatre and opera when performed in France . The earliest recorded visits by Italian players were commedia dell'arte companies employed by the French court under the Italian-born queens Catherine de Medici and Marie de Medici . These troupes also gave public performances in Paris at the theatre of the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne , probably the earliest public theatre to be built in France . The first official use of the name Com\u00e9die-Italienne was in 1680 , when it was given to the commedia dell'arte troupe at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne , to distinguish it from the French troupe , the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise , which was founded that year , and just as the name Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais was commonly applied to the latter , Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien was used for the Italians . Over time French phrases , songs , whole scenes , and eventually entire plays were incorporated into the Com\u00e9die-Italienne 's performances . By 1762 the company was merged with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique , but the names Com\u00e9die-Italienne and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien continued to be used , even though the repertory soon became almost exclusively French op\u00e9ra-comique . The names were dropped completely in 1801 , when the company was merged with the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Feydeau . From 1801 to 1878 , Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien was used for a succession of Parisian opera companies performing Italian opera in Italian . In 1980 the name La Com\u00e9die-Italienne was used for a theatre in the Montparnasse district of Paris , which presents Italian commedia dell'arte plays in French translation .",

It began performing in the Salle des Tuileries , located in the north wing of the Tuileries Palace , then moved to the Salle des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s at the Foire Saint-Germain , and finally , beginning in 1791 , settled into its own custom-built theatre , the Salle Feydeau located on the rue Feydeau . The company was renamed Feydeau after the royal family was arrested during the French Revolution . The company first presented Italian opera by composers such as Giovanni Battista Pergolesi , Giuseppe Sarti , and Giovanni Paisiello and later French plays , vaudevilles , and op\u00e9ras comiques , as well as symphonic concerts , and was especially famous for the quality of its orchestra and realistic stagings .

  "/wiki/Giovanni_Pacini": "Giovanni Pacini ( 17 February 1796 - 6 December 1867 ) was an Italian composer , best known for his operas . Pacini was born in Catania , Sicily , the son of the buffo Luigi Pacini , who was to appear in the premieres of many of Giovanni 's operas . The family was of Tuscan origin , living in Catania when the composer was born . His first 25 or so operas were written when Gioachino Rossini dominated the Italian operatic stage . But Pacini 's operas were rather superficial , a fact which , later , he candidly admitted in his Memoirs . For some years he held the post of director of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples . Later , retiring to Viareggio to found a school of music , Pacini took time to assess the state of opera in Italy and , during a five-year period during which he stopped composing , laid out his ideas in his Memoirs . Like Saverio Mercadante , who also reassessed the strength and weaknesses of this period in opera , Pacini 's style did change , but he quickly became eclipsed by the rising influence of Giuseppe Verdi on the Italian operatic scene , and many of his operas appeared to be old fashioned and rarely , if ever , appeared outside of Italy .

  "/wiki/Gioachino_Rossini": "Gioachino Antonio Rossini [ n 1 ] [ n 2 ] ( 29 February 1792 - 13 November 1868 ) was an Italian composer who gained fame for his 39 operas , although he also wrote many songs , some chamber music and piano pieces , and some sacred music . He set new standards for both comic and serious opera before retiring from large-scale composition while still in his thirties , at the height of his popularity . Born in Pesaro to parents who were both musicians ( his father a trumpeter , his mother a singer ) , Rossini began to compose by the age of 12 and was educated at music school in Bologna . His first opera was performed in Venice in 1810 when he was 18 years old . In 1815 he was engaged to write operas and manage theatres in Naples . In the period 1810-1823 he wrote 34 operas for the Italian stage that were performed in Venice , Milan , Ferrara , Naples and elsewhere ; this productivity necessitated an almost formulaic approach for some components ( such as overtures ) and a certain amount of self-borrowing . During this period he produced his most popular works including the comic operas L'italiana in Algeri , Il barbiere di Siviglia ( known in English as The Barber of Seville ) and La Cenerentola , which brought to a peak the opera buffa tradition he inherited from masters such as Domenico Cimarosa . He also composed opera seria works such as Otello , Tancredi and Semiramide . All of these attracted admiration for their innovation in melody , harmonic and instrumental colour , and dramatic form . In 1824 he was contracted by the Op\u00e9ra in Paris , for which he produced an opera to celebrate the coronation of Charles X , Il viaggio a Reims ( later cannibalised for his first opera in French , Le comte Ory ) , revisions of two of his Italian operas , Le si\u00e8ge de Corinthe and Mo\u00efse , and in 1829 his last opera , Guillaume Tell . Rossini 's withdrawal from opera for the last 40 years of his life has never been fully explained ; contributary factors may have been ill-health , the wealth his success had brought him , and the rise of spectacular grand opera under composers such as Giacomo Meyerbeer . From the early 1830s to 1855 , when he left Paris and was based in Bologna , Rossini wrote relatively little .",

The building faces Catherine Street ( earlier named Bridges or Brydges Street ) and backs onto Drury Lane . The building is the most recent in a line of four theatres which were built at the same location , the earliest of which dated back to 1663 , making it the oldest theatre site in London still in use . According to the author Peter Thomson , for its first two centuries , Drury Lane could reasonably have claimed to be London 's leading theatre . For most of that time , it was one of a handful of patent theatres , granted monopoly rights to the production of legitimate drama in London ( meaning spoken plays , rather than opera , dance , concerts , or plays with music ) . The first theatre on the site was built at the behest of Thomas Killigrew in the early 1660s , when theatres were allowed to reopen during the English Restoration . Initially known as Theatre Royal in Bridges Street , the theatre 's proprietors hired prominent actors who performed at the theatre on a regular basis , including Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart . In 1672 , the theatre caught fire and Killigrew built a larger theatre on the same plot , renamed the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane ; it opened in 1674 . This building lasted nearly 120 years , under the leaderships of Colley Cibber , David Garrick and Richard Brinsley Sheridan , the last of whom employed Joseph Grimaldi as the theatre 's resident Clown . In 1791 , under Sheridan 's management , the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794 . This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809 .

He was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means , and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron . Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Vincenzo Bellini , Gaetano Donizetti , and Gioachino Rossini , whose works significantly influenced him . In his early operas , Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy . He also participated briefly as an elected politician . The chorus Va , pensiero from his early opera Nabucco ( 1842 ) , and similar choruses in later operas , were much in the spirit of the unification movement , and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals . An intensely private person , Verdi , however , did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region . He surprised the musical world by returning , after his success with the opera Aida ( 1871 ) , with three late masterpieces : his Requiem ( 1874 ) , and the operas Otello ( 1887 ) and Falstaff ( 1893 ) . His operas remain extremely popular , especially the three peaks of his 'middle period ' : Rigoletto , Il trovatore and La traviata , and the 2013 bicentenary of his birth was widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances .",

He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III , and awarded a lifetime pension . Although musically precocious , Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant . There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood .

Like most operas , an oratorio includes the use of a choir , soloists , an instrumental ensemble , various distinguishable characters , and arias . However , opera is musical theatre , while oratorio is strictly a concert piece - though oratorios are sometimes staged as operas , and operas are sometimes presented in concert form . In an oratorio the choir often plays a central role , and there is generally little or no interaction between the characters , and no props or elaborate costumes . A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text . Opera tends to deal with history and mythology , including age-old devices of romance , deception , and murder , whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics , making it appropriate for performance in the church . Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible , while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints , as well as to Biblical topics . Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church 's prohibition of spectacles during Lent .

  "/wiki/Jeanne_d'Arc_au_B\u00fbcher": "Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher ( Joan of Arc at the Stake ) is an oratorio by Arthur Honegger , originally commissioned by Ida Rubinstein . It was set to a libretto by Paul Claudel , and the work runs about 70 minutes . It premiered on 12 May 1938 in Basel , with Rubinstein as Jeanne , and Jean P\u00e9rier in the speaking role of Brother Dominique , with the Basel Boys Choir singing the children 's chorus part , and Paul Sacher conducting . The drama takes place during the heroine 's last minutes on the stake , with flashbacks to her trial and her younger days . Honegger entitled his work a dramatic oratorio , adding speaking roles and actors . The work has an important part for the ondes Martenot , an early electronic instrument ( played at the premiere by its inventor Maurice Martenot ) . Claudel 's dramatic frame provided Honegger with a space - between heaven and earth , past and present - where he could mix styles from the popular to the sublime . A hybrid work : partly oratorio and partly opera , Honegger uses all his musical means , monody , harmony and counterpoint to build towards sculpted blocks of sound .",

  "/wiki/Inquisition": "The Inquisition , in historical ecclesiastical parlance also referred to as the Holy Inquisition , was a group of institutions within the Catholic Church whose aim was to combat heresy . The Inquisition started in 12th-century France to combat religious dissent , in particular the Cathars and the Waldensians . Other groups investigated later included the Spiritual Franciscans , the Hussites ( followers of Jan Hus ) and the Beguines . Beginning in the 1250s , inquisitors were generally chosen from members of the Dominican Order , replacing the earlier practice of using local clergy as judges . The term Medieval Inquisition covers these courts up to mid-15th century . During the Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance , the concept and scope of the Inquisition significantly expanded in response to the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation . It expanded to other European countries , resulting in the Spanish Inquisition and Portuguese Inquisition . The Spanish and Portuguese operated inquisitorial courts throughout their empires in Africa , Asia , and the Americas ( resulting in the Peruvian Inquisition and Mexican Inquisition ) . The Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions focused particularly on the issue of Jewish anusim and Muslim converts to Catholicism , partly because these minority groups were more numerous in Spain and Portugal than in many other parts of Europe , and partly because they were often considered suspect due to the assumption that they had secretly reverted to their previous religions . With the exception of the Papal States , the institution of the Inquisition was abolished in the early 19th century , after the Napoleonic Wars in Europe and the Spanish American wars of independence in the Americas . The institution survived as part of the Roman Curia , but in 1908 it was renamed the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office . In 1965 it became the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith .",
  "/wiki/Heresy": "Heresy is any belief or theory that is strongly at variance with established beliefs or customs , in particular the accepted beliefs of a church or religious organization .

Heresy is distinct from both apostasy , which is the explicit renunciation of one 's religion , principles or cause , and blasphemy , which is an impious utterance or action concerning God or sacred things . The term is usually used to refer to violations of important religious teachings , but is used also of views strongly opposed to any generally accepted ideas . It is used in particular in reference to Christianity , Judaism , and Islam . In certain historical Christian , Muslim and Jewish cultures , among others , espousing ideas deemed heretical has been and in some cases still is met with censure ranging from excommunication to the death penalty .",

However , he did adapt part of the opera into a symphony of the same title in 1951 . The symphony was later renamed Seraphic Ode . Dello Joio returned to the subject of Joan of Arc in 1955 when he was commissioned by the NBC Television Opera Theatre to produce an original 75-minute opera for television . The resulting work in two acts was retitled The Trial at Rouen , and , in using new music and a new libretto by Dello Joio , was in effect a completely different musical drama from its predecessor . It premiered on April 8 , 1956 on NBC . Dello Joio adapted the work a third time , extending the music at the beginning and end of the 1956 version ( including some music from the 1950 opera ) to create a one-act opera for the stage . This third version , once again called The Triumph of St. Joan , was premiered by the New York City Opera on April 16 , 1959 .",

  "/wiki/Philippe_Soupault": "Philippe Soupault ( 2 August 1897 , Chaville , Hauts-de-Seine - 12 March 1990 , Paris ) was a French writer and poet , novelist , critic , and political activist . He was active in Dadaism and later founded the Surrealist movement with Andr\u00e9 Breton . Soupault initiated the periodical Litt\u00e9rature together with the writers Breton and Louis Aragon in Paris in 1919 , which , for many , marks the beginnings of Surrealism . The first book of automatic writing , Les Champs magn\u00e9tiques ( 1920 ) , was co-authored by Soupault and Breton . In 1927 Soupault , with the help of his then wife Marie-Louise , translated William Blake 's Songs of Innocence and Experience into French . The next year , Soupault authored a monograph on Blake , arguing the poet was a genius whose work anticipated the Surrealist movement in literature . In 1933 at a reception at the Russian Embassy in Paris , he met R\u00e9 Richter and they decided to do some travel reportage together . R\u00e9 Richter 's photographs , taken with her 6x6 Rolleiflex , were to be published alongside Philippe Souault 's literary texts . In the years thereafter , the two of them continued in the same vein , travelling to Germany , Switzerland , England , Scandinavia and Tunisia . They married in 1937 . The couple separated after the end of the war ; he moved back to Europe and she remained in New York . He directed Radio Tunis from 1937 to 1940 , when he was arrested by the pro-Vichy regime ."
