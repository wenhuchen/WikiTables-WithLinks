He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a captain in the War of 1812 . He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the Mississippi River and entered the Black Hawk War as a colonel in 1832 . His success in the Second Seminole War attracted national attention and earned him the nickname Old Rough and Ready . In 1845 , during the annexation of Texas , President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande in anticipation of a battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas-Mexico border . The Mexican-American War broke out in April 1846 , and Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General Mariano Arista at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and drove his troops out of Texas . Taylor then led his troops into Mexico , where they defeated Mexican troops commanded by Pedro de Ampudia at the Battle of Monterrey .

The Union retained control of the critical border state of Kentucky for the remainder of the war .

Union forces first skirmished with Confederate cavalry on the Springfield Pike before the fighting became more general , on Peters Hill , when the Confederate infantry arrived . Both sides were desperate to get access to fresh water . The next day , at dawn , fighting began again around Peters Hill as a Union division advanced up the pike , halting just before the Confederate line . After noon , a Confederate division struck the Union left flank - the I Corps of Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook - and forced it to fall back . When more Confederate divisions joined the fray , the Union line made a stubborn stand , counterattacked , but finally fell back with some units routed . Buell , several miles behind the action , was unaware that a major battle was taking place and did not send any reserves to the front until late in the afternoon . The Union troops on the left flank , reinforced by two brigades , stabilized their line , and the Confederate attack sputtered to a halt .",
