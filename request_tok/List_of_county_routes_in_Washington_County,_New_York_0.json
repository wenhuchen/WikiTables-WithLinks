  "/wiki/Lake_George_(New_York)": "Lake George , nicknamed the Queen of American Lakes , is a long , narrow oligotrophic lake located at the southeast base of the Adirondack Mountains , in the northeastern portion of the U.S. state of New York . It lies within the upper region of the Great Appalachian Valley and drains all the way northward into Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence River drainage basin . The lake is situated along the historical natural ( Amerindian ) path between the valleys of the Hudson and St. Lawrence Rivers , and so lies on the direct land route between Albany , New York and Montreal , Quebec , Canada . The lake extends about 32.2 mi ( 51.8 km ) on a north-south axis , is quite deep , and varies from one to three miles ( 1.6 to 4.8 km ) in width , presenting a significant barrier to east-west travel . Although the year-round population of the Lake George region is relatively small , the summertime population can swell to over 50,000 residents , many in the village of Lake George region at the southern end of the lake . [ not verified in body ] Lake George drains into Lake Champlain to its north through a short stream , the La Chute River , with many falls and rapids , dropping 226 feet ( 69 m ) in its 3.5-mile ( 5.6 km ) course - virtually all of which is within the lands of Ticonderoga , New York and near the site of the Fort Ticonderoga . Ultimately the waters flowing via the 106-mile-long ( 171 km ) Richelieu River drain into the St. Lawrence River downstream and northeast of Montreal , and then into the North Atlantic Ocean above Nova Scotia .",

  "/wiki/NY_22": "New York State Route 22 ( NY 22 ) is a north-south state highway that parallels the eastern border of the U.S. state of New York , from the outskirts of New York City to the hamlet of Mooers in Clinton County near the Canadian border . At 337 miles ( 542 km ) , it is the state 's longest north-south route and the third longest state route overall , after NY 5 and NY 17 . [ a ] Many of the state 's major east-west roads intersect with , and often join , NY 22 just before crossing into the neighboring New England states , where U.S. Route 7 ( US 7 ) , which originally partially followed NY 22 's alignment , similarly parallels the New York state line . Almost all of NY 22 is a two-lane rural road through small villages and hamlets . The exceptions are its southern end in the heavily populated Bronx and lower Westchester County , and a section that runs through the city of Plattsburgh near the northern end . The rural landscape that the road passes through varies from horse country and views of the reservoirs of the New York City watershed in the northern suburbs of the city , to dairy farms further upstate in the Taconic and Berkshire mountains , to the undeveloped , heavily forested Adirondack Park along the shores of Lake Champlain . An 86-mile ( 138 km ) section from Fort Ann to Keeseville is part of the All-American Road known as the Lakes to Locks Passage . The oldest portions of today 's NY 22 , in Westchester County and along the Lake Champlain shoreline , were Native American trails . Dutch , and after them English , settlers continued to use the road to get their farm products to market , with the southernmost portion eventually becoming the White Plains Post Road in the 18th and 19th centuries . In the early 20th century , as automobile use became widespread , the state paved the more heavily used sections and built new roads to create the current highway , first designated as NY 22 in 1930 . In its early years the highway began in Manhattan ; until 2008 its northern end was the Canadian border .",

The route runs along the Hudson River from Troy to Hudson Falls and the Champlain Canal from Fort Ann to Whitehall . It passes through several riverside and canalside communities , including two cities ( Troy and Mechanicville ) and seven villages . US 4 crosses several major east-west highways as it proceeds north , such as Interstate 90 ( I-90 ) in East Greenbush , New York State Route 7 ( NY 7 ) in Troy , NY 29 in Schuylerville , and NY 149 in Fort Ann . It also overlaps with the north-south NY 22 for 6 miles ( 10 km ) from Comstock to Whitehall and with NY 32 for a total of 16 miles ( 26 km ) between Waterford and Bemis Heights and from Schuylerville to Northumberland . US 4 was assigned in 1926 and initially extended from Glens Falls to the Vermont border near Whitehall by way of Hudson Falls . The route utilized part of NY 6 and NY 30 , two highways assigned in 1924 . US 4 was extended southward to its present terminus in East Greenbush as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Much of US 4 south of Hudson Falls initially overlapped with other routes ; most of the overlaps were gradually eliminated during the 1940s and 1950s as the concurrent routes were eliminated or truncated .",
  "/wiki/Vermont": "Vermont ( /v\u0259r\u02c8m\u0252nt/ ( listen ) ) is a northeastern U.S. state in the New England region . It borders the states of Massachusetts to the south , New Hampshire to the east , and New York to the west , and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north . Vermont is the second-smallest by population and the sixth-smallest by area of the 50 U.S. states . The state capital is Montpelier , the least populous state capital in the United States . The most populous city , Burlington , is the least populous city to be the most populous city in a state . Vermont 's crime statistics for the period 2016-8 caused it to be ranked as the safest state in the country . For some 12,000 years , indigenous peoples inhabited this area . The historically competitive tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk were active in the area at the time of European encounter . During the 17th century , French colonists claimed the territory as part of the Kingdom of France 's colony of New France . After the Kingdom of Great Britain began to settle colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast , the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe . For years , each country enlisted Native American allies in continuous raiding and warfare between the New England and New France colonies . This produced an active trade in captives taken during such raids , often held for ransom , although some captives were adopted by families into the Mohawk or Abenaki tribes .",
