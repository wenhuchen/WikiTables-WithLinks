  "section_title": "List of Characters featured in Hoot mini-strips",
  "section_text": "The comic also featured short , four-frame strips featuring pre-existing DC Thomson characters , but few of these strips seemed to have been drawn by their `` proper '' artists , hence a rather odd-looking Lord Snooty . [ 1 ] Below is a list of these four frame strips . These strips were drawn by George Martin and after Hoot 's merger with The Dandy they reappeared in The Dandy ( still drawn by George Martin ) under the title Comic Cuts and this time featured more Dandy characters than in Hoot .",
  "uid": "Hoot_(comics)_1",
  "intro": "Hoot was a British comic magazine that ran from (issues dates) 26 October 1985 to 25 October 1986, when it merged with The Dandy. Its cover price was 20p, represented by a stylized graphic depiction of a 20p coin. Throughout its run, it billed itself as Britain's bubbling new comic!, a reference to the title masthead being made up of steam-billowing pipes (hence the title). The comic was the last new humour anthology comic from DC Thomson which mostly featured original characters."
