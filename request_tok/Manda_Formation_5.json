  "/wiki/Aleodon_brachyrhamphus": "Chiniquodontidae is an extinct family of meat-eating advanced mammal-like reptiles ( therapsids ) that lived during the Upper Triassic of South America and perhaps Europe . A further possible representative , Aleodon , has been identified from the Middle Triassic of Africa . The family is thought to have been reasonably closely related to the ancestors of mammals . They ranged in size from tiny Gaumia ( should it be a chiniquodontid ) to the dog-sized Belesodon . Other fairly closely related creatures are known as Eoraetia , from the Upper Triassic of Europe , and the rather indeterminate Kunminia , from the Lower Jurassic of China .",

  "/wiki/Trirachodontidae": "Trirachodontidae is an extinct family of cynognathian cynodonts from the Triassic of China and southern Africa . Trirachodontids appeared during the Early Triassic soon after the Permian-Triassic extinction event and quickly spread over a wide geographic area in a comparatively brief amount of time from 250 to 237 million years ago . Trirachodontids have wide skulls and short , narrow snouts . Two large holes called temporal fenestrae run along the back of the head and have a uniformly large width . Trirachodontids also have two large canine teeth and smaller cusped postcanines . Most of the features that distinguish trirachodonts from other cynodonts are found in their dentition . Trirachodontids lived in semi-arid environments with seasonal rainfall . The bone structure of trirachodontids suggests that they grew quickly in seasons with high rainfall and slowly in less favorable seasons . One trirachodontid , Trirachodon , has been found in association with complex burrow systems . These burrows were probably used by many individuals to hide from predators , raise young , or stay warm . Two subfamilies of trirachodontids are recognized : Trirachodontinae from Africa and Sinognathinae from China . Below is a cladogram from Gao et al .",
  "/wiki/Cynognathus_crateronotus": "Cynognathus is an extinct genus of large-bodied cynodontian therapsids that lived in the Middle Triassic . It is known from a single species , Cynognathus crateronotus . Cynognathus was a 1.2-metre ( 3 ft 11 in ) long predator closely related to mammals and had a southern hemispheric distribution . Fossils have so far been recovered from South Africa , Argentina , Antarctica , and Namibia .",

  "/wiki/Diademodon_tetragonas": "Diademodon is an extinct genus of cynodonts . It was about 2 metres ( 6.6 ft ) long . Although Diademodon is the most well accepted name for the genera to date , it was originally named Cynochampsa laniarius by Owen in 1860 . The proposed name change occurred in 1982 , where Grine defended the name proposed by Harry Seeley : Diademodon tetragonus and to be place in the group Therapsida , which was a group Owen had tiptoed around in his works on paleontology . Though Harry Govier Seeley had named Diademodon in 1894 , which was after Owen had dubbed the genus Cynochampsa , Seeley had not realized the two were one and the same as the fossil that Owen named was claimed to have been found in a claystone nodule in the Renosterberg Mountains . A later paleontologist explored the same area where the fossil was claimed to have been found and declared no evidence of Cynognathus fossils .",
  "/wiki/Diademodontid": "Diademodontidae is an extinct family of Triassic gomphodonts . The best-known genus is Diademodon from South Africa . Titanogomphodon from Namibia may also be a member of Diademodontidae . The Chinese genera Hazhenia and Ordosiodon have also been included in the family , but were more recently identified as baurioid therocephalians . Remains of a diademodontid have been discovered in the Early Triassic Fremouw Formation in Antarctica .",

The type species S. angustifrons was named in 1946 and several other species were named in the following years . Most of the species from Africa are now thought to belong to different genera than Scalenodon .",
  "/wiki/Traversodontid": "Traversodontidae is a family of herbivorous cynodonts . Traversodonts were primarily Gondwanan , with many species known from Africa and South America . Recently , traversodonts have also been found from Europe and eastern North America . Traversodonts first appeared in the Middle Triassic and became extinct in the Early Jurassic diversifying in the Late Triassic . The family Traversodontidae was created by Friedrich von Huene in 1936 for cynodonts first found in S\u00e3o Pedro do Sul in Paleorrota , Brazil .",

  "/wiki/Mandagomphodon_hirschoni": "Mandagomphodon is an extinct genus of traversodontid cynodonts from the Middle Triassic Lifua Member of the Manda Beds of Ruhuhu Valley , Tanzania . The type species Mandagomphodon hirschsoni was named by Crompton in 1972 as a species referable to Scalenodon . Later studies , including a 2003 phylogenetic analysis of traversodontid relationships , did not find the species of Scalenodon from the Manda Formation to form a single clade , meaning that many were not referable to the genus . The study suggested that S. hirschsoni had more in common with other traversodontids like Luangwa . S. attridgei was viewed as a possible synonym of S. charigi , which was also found to be only distantly related to S. angustifrons . Therefore , a new generic name Mandagomphodon was erected for S. hirschsoni by James A. Hopson in 2013 ."
