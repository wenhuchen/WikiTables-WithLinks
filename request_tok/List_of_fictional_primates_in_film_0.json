  "/wiki/Gorilla": "Gorillas are ground-dwelling , predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa . The genus Gorilla is divided into two species : the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas ( both critically endangered ) , and either four or five subspecies . They are the largest living primates . The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans , from 95 to 99% depending on what is included , and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos . Gorillas ' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Sub-Saharan Africa . Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa , gorillas cover a wide range of elevations . The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes , ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres ( 7,200 to 14,100 ft ) . Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level , with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda .",
  "/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_(1968_film)": "Planet of the Apes is a 1968 American science fiction film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner . It stars Charlton Heston , Roddy McDowall , Kim Hunter , Maurice Evans , James Whitmore , James Daly and Linda Harrison . The screenplay by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling was loosely based on the 1963 French novel La Plan\u00e8te des Singes by Pierre Boulle . Jerry Goldsmith composed the groundbreaking avant-garde score . It was the first in a series of five films made between 1968 and 1973 , all produced by Arthur P. Jacobs and released by 20th Century Fox . The film tells the story of an astronaut crew who crash-lands on a strange planet in the distant future . Although the planet appears desolate at first , the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human-like intelligence and speech . The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins . The script , originally written by Serling , underwent many rewrites before filming eventually began . Directors J. Lee Thompson and Blake Edwards were approached , but the film 's producer Arthur P. Jacobs , upon the recommendation of Charlton Heston , chose Franklin J. Schaffner to direct the film . Schaffner 's changes included an ape society less advanced - and therefore less expensive to depict - than that of the original novel . Filming took place between May 21 and August 10 , 1967 , in California , Utah and Arizona , with desert sequences shot in and around Lake Powell , Glen Canyon National Recreation Area .",

  "/wiki/Common_chimpanzee": "The chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) , also known as the common chimpanzee , robust chimpanzee , or simply chimp , is a species of great ape native to the forests and savannahs of tropical Africa . It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies . The chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo ( sometimes called the pygmy chimpanzee ) are classified in the genus Pan . Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is humans ' closest living relative . The chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair , but has a bare face , fingers , toes , palms of the hands , and soles of the feet . It is larger and more robust than the bonobo , weighing 40-60 kg ( 88-132 lb ) for males and 27-50 kg ( 60-110 lb ) for females and standing 100 to 140 cm ( 3.3 to 4.6 ft ) . Its gestation period is eight months . The infant is weaned at about three years old , but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more . The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members , although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day . The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy , where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence . Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools , modifying sticks , rocks , grass and leaves and using them for hunting and acquiring honey , termites , ants , nuts and water . The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals .",

  "/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture": "The nature versus nurture debate involves whether human behavior is determined by the environment , either prenatal or during a person 's life , or by a person 's genes . The alliterative expression nature and nurture in English has been in use since at least the Elizabethan period and goes back to medieval French . The combination of the two concepts as complementary is ancient ( Greek : \u1f01\u03c0\u03cc \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b5\u1f50\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 ) . Nature is what we think of as pre-wiring and is influenced by genetic inheritance and other biological factors . Nurture is generally taken as the influence of external factors after conception e.g . the product of exposure , experience and learning on an individual . The phrase in its modern sense was popularized by the English Victorian polymath Francis Galton , the modern founder of eugenics and behavioral genetics , discussing the influence of heredity and environment on social advancement . Galton was influenced by the book On the Origin of Species written by his half-cousin , Charles Darwin . The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from nurture was termed tabula rasa ( blank slate ) by John Locke in 1690 . A blank slate view in human developmental psychology , one that assumes that human behavioral traits develop almost exclusively from environmental influences ( sometimes termed blank-slatism ) , was widely held during much of the 20th century . The debate between blank-slate denial of the influence of heritability , and the view admitting both environmental and heritable traits , has often been cast in terms of nature versus nurture . These two conflicting approaches to human development were at the core of an ideological dispute over research agendas throughout the second half of the 20th century .",

Orangutans are currently only found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra . Classified in the genus Pongo , orangutans were originally considered to be one species . From 1996 , they were divided into two species : the Bornean orangutan ( P. pygmaeus , with three subspecies ) and the Sumatran orangutan ( P. abelii ) . In November 2017 it was reported that a third species had been identified , the Tapanuli orangutan ( P. tapanuliensis ) .

The Tapanuli orangutan separated from the Bornean orangutan much later , about 670,000 years ago . The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae , which also included several other species , such as the three extinct species of the genus Gigantopithecus , including the largest known primate , Gigantopithecus blacki . The ancestors of the Ponginae split from the main ape line in Africa more than 14 million years ago ( Mya ) , then spread into Asia .

  "/wiki/Monkey": "Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals , in part , the simians of infraorder Simiiformes . The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates , such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys . Many monkey species are tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) , although there are species that live primarily on the ground , such as baboons . Most species are also active during the day ( diurnal ) . Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent , especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini . Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago . New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago . Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago . Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [ 35-32 million years ago ] , eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists . Lemurs , lorises , and galagos are not monkeys ; instead they are strepsirrhine primates . Like monkeys , tarsiers are haplorhine primates ; however , they are also not monkeys .

  "/wiki/The_Jungle_Book": "The Jungle Book ( 1894 ) is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling . Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear , though a principal character is the boy or man-cub Mowgli , who is raised in the jungle by wolves . The stories are set in a forest in India ; one place mentioned repeatedly is Seonee ( Seoni ) , in the central state of Madhya Pradesh . A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering , as in the life of Mowgli , echoing Kipling 's own childhood . The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies , as well as Mowgli 's . Another important theme is of law and freedom ; the stories are not about animal behaviour , still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival , but about human archetypes in animal form . They teach respect for authority , obedience , and knowing one 's place in society with the law of the jungle , but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds , such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village . Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories , reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature . The Jungle Book has remained popular , partly through its many adaptations for film and other media . Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling . The book has been influential in the scout movement , whose founder , Robert Baden-Powell , was a friend of Kipling 's . Percy Grainger composed his Jungle Book Cycle around quotations from the book .",
