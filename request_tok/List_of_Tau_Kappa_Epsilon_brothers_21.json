With this group , Miller used an arrangement he wrote for British bandleader Ray Noble 's American band in an attempt to form a clarinet-reed sound . This style developed over time , and eventually became known as the Glenn Miller sound . Frustrated with his agency over playing inconsistent bookings and lacking broad radio exposure , Miller gave the band notice in December 1937 .
