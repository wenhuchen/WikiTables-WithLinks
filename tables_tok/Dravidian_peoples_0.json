  "intro": "Dravidian people or Dravidians are the present and past speakers of any of the Dravidian languages. There are around 245 million native speakers of Dravidian languages. Dravidian speakers form the majority of the population of South India and are natively found in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. Proto-Dravidian may have been spoken in the Indus civilization, suggesting a tentative date of Proto-Dravidian around the early part of the third millennium, after which it branched into various Dravidian languages. South Dravidian I (including pre-Tamil) and South Dravidian II (including pre-Telugu) split around the eleventh century BCE, with the other major branches splitting off at around the same time. The origins of the Dravidians are a very complex subject of research and debate. They may have been indigenous to the Indian subcontinent, but origins in, or influence from, West-Asia have also been proposed. Their origins are often viewed as being connected with the Indus Valley Civilisation, hence people and language spread east- and southwards after the demise of the Indus Valley Civilisation in the early second millennium BCE, concurrently with the arrival of Indo-Aryan speakers, with whom they intensively interacted. Some recent DNA evidence indicates a linkage between a corpse found in the Harappan site of Rakhigarhi in Haryana. From these interactions and migrations arose eventually the so-called Hindus synthesis, after 500 BCE. The third century BCE onwards saw the development of large kingdoms in South India. Medieval South Indian guilds and trading organisations like the Ayyavole of Karnataka and Manigramam played an important role in the Southeast Asia trade, and the cultural Indianisation of the region."
