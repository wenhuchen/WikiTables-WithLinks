  "/wiki/Feminist": "Feminism is a range of social movements , political movements , and ideologies that aim to define , establish , and achieve the political , economic , personal , and social equality of the sexes . [ a ] Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view , and that women are treated unfairly within those societies . Efforts to change that include fighting gender stereotypes and seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men . Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women 's rights , including the right to vote , to hold public office , to work , to earn fair wages , equal pay and eliminate the gender pay gap , to own property , to receive education , to enter contracts , to have equal rights within marriage , and to have maternity leave . Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and social integration and to protect women and girls from rape , sexual harassment , and domestic violence . Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements . Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women 's rights , particularly in the West , where they are near-universally credited with achieving women 's suffrage , gender-neutral language , reproductive rights for women ( including access to contraceptives and abortion ) , and the right to enter into contracts and own property . Although feminist advocacy is , and has been , mainly focused on women 's rights , some feminists , including bell hooks , argue for the inclusion of men 's liberation within its aims , because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles . Feminist theory , which emerged from feminist movements , aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women 's social roles and lived experience ; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender . Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims . Some forms of feminism have been criticized for taking into account only white , middle class , and college-educated perspectives . This criticism led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism , including black feminism and intersectional feminism .",

It is New York City 's most populous borough , with an estimated 2,504,700 residents in 2010 . Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen , it shares a land border with the borough of Queens at the western end of Long Island .

If each borough were ranked as a city , Brooklyn would rank as the third-most populous in the U.S. , after Los Angeles and Chicago . Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city ( and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution ) until January 1 , 1898 , when , after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s , according to the new Municipal Charter of Greater New York , Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities , boroughs , and counties to form the modern City of New York , surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs . The borough continues , however , to maintain a distinct culture . Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves . Brooklyn 's official motto , displayed on the Borough seal and flag , is Eendraght Maeckt Maght , which translates from early modern Dutch as Unity makes strength . In the first decades of the 21st century , Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as an avant-garde destination for hipsters , with concomitant gentrification , dramatic house price increases and a decrease in housing affordability . Since the 2010s , Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship , high technology startup firms , postmodern art and design .",
