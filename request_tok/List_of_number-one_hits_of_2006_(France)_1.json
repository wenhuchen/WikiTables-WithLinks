  "/wiki/B\u00e9nabar": "Bruno Nicolini ( born 16 June 1969 ) , better known by his stage name B\u00e9nabar , is a French songwriter and singer , who could be compared to Vincent Delerm and other singers from his generation . As many of them he was influenced by Georges Brassens , Renaud , Jacques Higelin and also Tom Waits . His songs describe day-to-day life events with humour and a tender cynicism . His songs are influenced by French chanson and a heavy influence is placed on the piano or the accordion and on typical French fanfare ( brass band ) for the most upbeat of them . This genre of music is very typically French and differs from most in that emphasis is placed on appreciation of the lyrics and that it is linked to a specific culture of modern guinche ( slang for guinguette ) appreciated a lot by Bobos among others .",
