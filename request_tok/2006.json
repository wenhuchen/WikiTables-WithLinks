As an American citizen , he was transferred to a military prison brig on the mainland of the United States . His challenge to his detention , without being informed of charges or brought to trial , was a case that reached the United States Supreme Court . In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld ( 2004 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that detainees who are U.S. citizens must have the rights of due process , and the ability to challenge their enemy combatant status before an impartial authority . After this decision , the government made a deal with Hamdi . After he agreed to renounce his US citizenship and observe travel restrictions , in October 2004 Hamdi was deported to Saudi Arabia .
