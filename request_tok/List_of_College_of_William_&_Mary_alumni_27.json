Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008 . On September 15 , 2008 , the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the exodus of most of its clients , drastic losses in its stock , and devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies , largely sparked by a loss of confidence , Lehman 's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis , and its exposure to less liquid assets . Lehman 's bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history , and is thought to have played a major role in the unfolding of the financial crisis of 2007-2008 . The market collapse also gave support to the Too big to fail doctrine . After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy , global markets immediately plummeted . The following day , Barclays announced its agreement to purchase , subject to regulatory approval , Lehman 's North American investment-banking and trading divisions along with its New York headquarters building . On September 20 , 2008 , a revised version of that agreement was approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck .
