  "/wiki/Co-educational": "Mixed-sex education , also known as mixed-gender education , co-education or coeducation ( abbreviated to co-ed or coed ) , is a system of education where males and females are educated together . Whereas single-sex education was more common up to the 19th century , mixed-sex education has since become standard in many cultures , particularly in Western countries . Single-sex education , however , remains prevalent in many Muslim countries . The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate . The world 's oldest co-educational school is thought to be Archbishop Tenison 's Church of England High School , Croydon , established in 1714 in the United Kingdom , which admitted boys and girls from its opening onwards . This has always been a day school only . The world 's oldest co-educational day and boarding school is Dollar Academy , a junior and senior school for males and females from ages 5 to 18 in Scotland , United Kingdom . From its opening in 1818 , the school admitted both boys and girls of the parish of Dollar and the surrounding area . The school continues in existence to the present day with around 1,250 pupils . The first co-educational college to be founded was Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Oberlin , Ohio . It opened on December 3 , 1833 , with 44 students , including 29 men and 15 women . Fully equal status for women did not arrive until 1837 , and the first three women to graduate with bachelor 's degrees did so in 1840 .",
