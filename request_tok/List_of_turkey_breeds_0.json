  "/wiki/Beltsville_Small_White": "The Beltsville Small White is a breed of domestic turkey . The bird was named after its physical characteristics - a relatively small size and entirely white plumage - as well as its place of origin : the USDA 's Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland . The Beltsville Small White was developed beginning in 1934 in response to market research that said consumers wanted a turkey of small to medium size with no dark pinfeathers . In a breeding program at the Beltsville Center that lasted from 1934 to 1941 , the USDA used White Holland , White Austrian , Narragansett , Bronze , and wild turkey genetics . The breed was used commercially in the 1940s , and was recognized officially by the American Poultry Association in 1951 . As a result of being developed specifically for smaller , urban households , the breed never had the size to satisfy the demands of restaurants . By the 1970s , it had nearly disappeared , and the Broad Breasted White had come into prominence . It is still extremely rare today , and is listed as Critical by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy . It retains interest primarily among breed enthusiasts and those interested in a heritage turkey breed .",
  "/wiki/Heritage_turkey": "A heritage turkey is one of a variety of strains of domestic turkey which retains historic characteristics that are no longer present in the majority of turkeys raised for consumption since the mid-20th century . Heritage turkeys can be differentiated from other domestic turkeys in that they are biologically capable of being raised in a manner that more closely matches the natural behavior and life cycle of wild turkeys . Heritage turkeys have a relatively long lifespan and a much slower growth rate than turkeys bred for industrial agriculture , and unlike industrially bred turkeys , can reproduce without artificial insemination . More than ten different turkey breeds are classified as heritage turkeys , including the Auburn , Buff , Black , Bourbon Red , Narragansett , Royal Palm , Slate , Standard Bronze , and Midget White . Some prominent chefs , farmers , and food critics have also contended that heritage turkey meat tastes better and is more healthful . Despite increasing interest in heritage turkeys , they are still a tiny minority , perhaps 25,000 raised annually compared to more than 200,000,000 industrial turkeys and 7,000,000 turkeys in the wild , and most heritage breeds are endangered in some respect .",

  "/wiki/Maryland": "Maryland ( US : /\u02c8m\u025br\u0259l\u0259nd/ ( listen ) MERR-\u0259-l\u0259nd ) [ a ] is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States , bordering Virginia , West Virginia , and the District of Columbia to its south and west ; Pennsylvania to its north ; and Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to its east . The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",
  "/wiki/Black_turkey": "The Black , sometimes referred to as the Black Spanish or the Norfolk Black , is a breed of domestic turkey . The Black was developed in Europe from the Aztec turkeys originally brought from Mexico by Spanish explorers . Despite the monikers of Spanish and Norfolk ( England ) , birds of this type live in many European nations . Originally , black colored turkeys were a relative rarity among New World flocks , but Europeans heavily selected for this trait until it became predominant . The Norfolk Black is generally considered the oldest turkey breed in the UK . Black turkeys were sent in the holds of ships on the transatlantic crossing from Europe to the New World , and were raised by early colonists . It is possible that turkey consumed at the first Thanksgiving meal was taken from among European birds , rather than from among native wild turkeys , though both have common ancestors . Later , Blacks were crossed with the wild turkey to help produce breeds such as the Bronze , Narragansett , and Slate . They remained a commercially farmed variety in the U.S. until the early 20th century , but fell out of favor after the development of the Broad Breasted Bronze and Broad Breasted White . Fairly common in Europe , they are considered an endangered variety of heritage turkey today by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy , and are also included in Slow Food USA 's Ark of Taste , a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction .",
  "/wiki/Bourbon_Red_Turkey": "The Bourbon Red is a breed of domestic turkey named for its unique reddish plumage and for Bourbon County , Kentucky . The breed standard indicates that mature Bourbon Red toms ( males ) weigh 15 kilograms ( 33 pounds ) , and mature hens ( females ) weigh 8.2 kilograms ( 18 pounds ) . The breed standard indicates the Bourbon Red should weigh 10.4 kilograms ( 23 pounds ) for toms and 6.3 kilograms ( 14 pounds ) for hens at slaughter age ( 28 weeks ) . These standard weights were published with anticipation of the potential of the Bourbon Red and when the breed was at its prime . Though there are efforts to restore and accomplish the Bourbon Red standard , today these weights are realized by few breeders and growers . Bourbon Reds have been unrefined for too long due to the lack of selective breeding to preserve the breed . However , mature turkeys in a breeding flock will exhibit an intense fluctuate ~30% from these published weights due to their relentless , extensive and highly instinctive breeding season with their lowest weights typically being recorded in July . The breed 's feathers are a dark base color , with white primaries in the tail characterized by a soft red band and white flight feathers ; both the tail and wings feature chestnut coverts . The standard allows for a total of 30% red feathers in the tail before the bird is disqualified .",
  "/wiki/Bronze_Turkey": "The Bronze is a breed of domestic turkey . The name refers to its plumage , which bears an iridescent bronze-like sheen . The Bronze had been the most popular turkey throughout most of American history , but waned in popularity beginning in the mid-20th century . Later in its history , the breed was divided into two distinct types : the Broad Breasted Bronze and the Standard Bronze . A great deal of confusion exists about the difference between Standard and Broad Breasted Bronzes , or that there is any difference at all .

  "/wiki/Broad_Breasted_White": "The Broad Breasted White is commercially the most widely used breed of domesticated turkey . These birds have shorter breast bones and larger breasts , sometimes rendering them unable to breed without human assistance ( typically via artificial insemination ) . They produce more breast meat and their pin feathers are less visible when the carcass is dressed due to their white color . These properties have made the breed popular in commercial turkey production but enthusiasts of slow food argue that the development of this breed and the methods in commercial turkey production have come at a cost of less flavor . These birds are grown in large , fully automated grow-out barns , which may house as many as 10,000 birds . The growing process for these birds has been so well refined , the birds often grow to larger than 40 lbs . Average birds are typically 38-40 lbs . Because of their size , they are flightless and prone to health problems associated with being overweight ( due to excess muscle ) , such as heart disease , respiratory failure and joint damage ; even if such turkeys are spared from slaughter ( such as those involved in the annual turkey pardons ) , they usually have short lives as a result . Broad Breasted Whites also have a very high percentage of their eggs hatch , which makes turkey eggs as a food item a rare delicacy .",
  "/wiki/Narragansett_Turkey": "The Narragansett turkey is a breed of Meleagris gallopavo which descends from a cross between the eastern wild turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo silvestris ) and the domestic turkey . According to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy , the Narragansett turkey is a historic variety , unique to North America and is named for Narragansett Bay .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Palm_(turkey)": "The Royal Palm is a breed of domestic turkey . One of the few turkeys not primarily selected for meat production , the Royal Palm is best known as an ornamental bird with a unique appearance , largely white with bands of metallic black . Primarily kept as an exhibition bird , or on small farms , it lacks the size for large scale commercial use . Toms usually weigh 16 to 22 lbs and the hens 10 to 12 lbs . A relative newcomer among turkey breeds , the bird first appeared in the 1920s on a farm in Lake Worth , Florida , apparently as a cross between Black , Bronze , Narragansett , and native turkeys . Years of selective breeding followed to stabilize the coloring , and the Royal Palm was finally accepted by the American Poultry Association 's Standard of Perfection in 1971 . In Europe , a turkey with similar coloration is sometimes called the Cr\u00f6llwitzer , Pied , or Black-laced White . Along with the decline of most heritage turkey breeds after the adoption of the Broad Breasted White by the turkey industry , Royal Palms are a very endangered breed today . The breed is classified as being on watch status with the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy . It is also included in Slow Food USA 's Ark of Taste , a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction . The Australian and United States both report the breed as Endangered to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations . The toms are noted for being non-aggressive , and the hens are particularly good mothers .",

Lighter birds are sometimes called Lavender turkeys . :236 Turkeys of the Slate breed may actually be any number of shades between pure black and white , but only ash-gray birds are eligible for showing under the directive of the American Poultry Associations Standard of Perfection , into which they admitted as a variety in 1874.:236 Slate turkeys are listed as critically endangered by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy , and meet the definition of a heritage turkey breed .",
  "/wiki/White_Holland_turkey": "The White Holland is an old variety of domestic turkey known for its white plumage . The White Holland , whose connection to the Netherlands is unsubstantiated , originated from crosses of white European turkeys ( re ) imported to North America and crossed with native birds . The White Holland was first recognized by the American Poultry Association in 1874 , and today is considered a heritage turkey breed . The breed was crossed in the 1950s with the Broad Breasted Bronze to create the Broad Breasted White , which is now the most common turkey breed in the world . They were also the base for creating the also rare Beltsville Small White breed . Standard weights are today 36 pounds for a tom and 20 for a hen . The Holland is currently listed as threatened by The Livestock Conservancy in the United States . The Standard of Perfection mostly now does not distinguish between White Holland and Broad Breasted White , though the White Holland is known for its hardiness , smaller breast , and longer legs . In Britain , the same has occurred , and all white turkeys may be described by breeders as British White birds ."
