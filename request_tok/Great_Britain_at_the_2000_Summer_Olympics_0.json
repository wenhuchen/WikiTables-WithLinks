Born into a family who then ran a stud farm in Sussex , Faulds was then raised on the 300-acre ( 1.2 km2 ) family-owned Owl 's Lodge Farm in the Hampshire village of Longparish . On his tenth birthday , Faulds 's father Bruce bought him some shooting lessons , with Richard hitting 17 out of 25 clays in his first attempt . His father built him a range on the family farm , but just before finishing third in his first world junior championship , his PE teacher said that his hand-eye co-ordination was very poor . It was discovered that Faulds suffered from a weak left eye , which was corrected by special dot-to-dot exercises with such good effect that he now shoots left-handed . Faulds competed internationally for Britain at the age of 13 , and was a world junior champion when he was 16 . Three years later , Faulds competed in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics finishing fifth , and became the 1997 European champion . After working at the West London Gun Club for three years as an instructor , Faulds became a full-time shooter , and qualified for the 2000 Sydney games after shooting a then double trap world record score at a World Cup meeting held again in Atlanta , Georgia . Faulds shot a then Olympic record total of 143 in the preliminary round , and won his Olympic gold medal after a shoot-off at the Sydney International Shooting Centre , to become Britains first shooting gold medal-winner since Malcolm Cooper in 1988 .

  "/wiki/Darren_Campbell": "Darren Andrew Campbell , MBE ( born 12 September 1973 ) is a British former sprint athlete . He was the sprint coach at Wasps Rugby Club for the 2015-16 season . He competed in the 100 metres and 200 metres , as well as the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay . Campbell was a promising junior athlete and won a number of medals at the World and European Junior Championships . He spent two years away from athletics , playing professional football but returned in 1995 , attending his first Olympics shortly afterwards . He began to compete as part of the British 4 \u00d7 100 m relay team and between 1997 and 2000 he won two World Championship medals , a gold medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games , and set the European record in the event . Success also came in the individual events : he became the 1998 European Champion in the 100 m and won his first Olympic medal , a silver in the 200 m at the 2000 Sydney Games . In the 100 m he won silver at the 2002 European Championships and was the 2003 World Championships bronze medallist . Campbell formed part of perhaps Britain 's most successful relay team - they won in the European Cup in 1999 and 2000 , at the 2002 Commonwealth Games , and took the gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics ( the first time a British team had done so since 1912 ) . Campbell had also won a gold medal at the 2002 European Championships and a 2003 World Championship silver medal but had to return them when his running-mate , Dwain Chambers , tested positive for banned substances , sparking much animosity between the two . He won his last medal in 2006 , again taking the relay gold at the European Championships , and he retired shortly afterwards . His personal bests of 10.04 s in the 100 m and 20.13 s in the 200 m were not prodigiously quick by elite global standards , but over his career he earned an impressive reputation as a 'championship ' runner , saving his best for finals and collecting significantly more medals than his times alone would indicate .",
