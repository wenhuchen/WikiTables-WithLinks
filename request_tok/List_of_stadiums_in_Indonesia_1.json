  "/wiki/Luwu": "The Kingdom of Luwu ( also Luwuq or Wareq ) is generally thought to be the oldest kingdom in South Sulawesi . In 1889 , the Dutch Governor of Makassar placed Luwu 's heyday between the 10th and 14th centuries , but offered no evidence . The La Galigo , an epic poem composed in a literary form of the Bugis language , is the likely inspiration of Braam Morris dating . The La Galigo depicts a vaguely defined world of coastal and riverine kingdoms whose economies are based on trade . Two early centres of this world are Luwu and the kingdom of Cina ( pronounced Cheena ) in what is now Wajo . The incompatibility of the La Galigo 's trade-based political economy with the agricultural economies of other South Sulawesi kingdoms has led scholars to posit an intervening period of chaos to separate the two societies chronologically . Archaeological and textual research carried out since the 1980s has undermined this chronology . Extensive surveys and excavations in Luwu have revealed that the Bugis-speaking kingdom is a century or so younger than the oldest polities of the southwest peninsula . The earliest textual reference to Luwu is in the East Javanese court poem Desawarnana , dated 1365 , which lists Luwu , Bantaeng and Uda ( possibly Cina ) as the three major powers on the peninsula . However , there is no convincing archaeological evidence of Bugis settlement in Luwu before c.1300 CE . The new understanding is that Bugis speaking settlers from the western Cenrana valley began to settle along the coastal margins of Luwu around the year 1300 CE . The Gulf of Bone is not a Bugis-speaking area : it is a thinly populated region of great ethnic diversity in which Bugis speakers are a minority Speakers of Pamona , Padoe , Wotu and Lemolang languages live on the coastal lowlands and foothills , while the highland valleys are home to groups speaking other Central and South Sulawesi languages ."
