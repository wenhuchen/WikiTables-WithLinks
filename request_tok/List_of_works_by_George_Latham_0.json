  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Transept": "A transept ( with two semitransepts ) is a transverse part of any building , which lies across the main body of the edifice . In churches , a transept is an area set crosswise to the nave in a cruciform ( cross-shaped ) building within the Romanesque and Gothic Christian church architectural traditions . Each half of a transept is known as a semitransept .",

  "/wiki/Country_house": "An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside . Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house . This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city - hence , for these people , the term distinguished between town and country . However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive . While a ch\u00e2teau or a Schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building , a country house , similar to an Ansitz , is usually unfortified . If fortified , it is called a castle , but not all buildings with the name castle are fortified ( for example Highclere Castle ) .",
  "/wiki/Portico": "A portico is a porch leading to the entrance of a building , or extended as a colonnade , with a roof structure over a walkway , supported by columns or enclosed by walls . This idea was widely used in ancient Greece and has influenced many cultures , including most Western cultures . Some noteworthy examples of porticos are the East Portico of the United States Capitol , the portico adorning the Pantheon in Rome and the portico of University College London . Porticos are sometimes topped with pediments . Palladio was a pioneer of using temple-fronts for secular buildings . In the UK , the temple-front applied to The Vyne , Hampshire , was the first portico applied to an English country house . A pronaos ( UK : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0252s/ or US : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0259s/ ) is the inner area of the portico of a Greek or Roman temple , situated between the portico 's colonnade or walls and the entrance to the cella , or shrine . Roman temples commonly had an open pronaos , usually with only columns and no walls , and the pronaos could be as long as the cella . The word pronaos is Greek for before a temple . In Latin , a pronaos is also referred to as an anticum or prodomus .",

  "/wiki/Admiral": "Admiral is one of the highest ranks in some navies , and in many navies is the highest rank . The rank is generally thought to have originated in Sicily from a conflation of Arabic : \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 , am\u012br al-ba\u1e25r , prince in Arabic ; supervisor in Turkic ; ( commander ) of the sea , with Latin admirabilis ( admirable ) or admiratus ( admired ) , although alternative etymologies derive the word directly from Latin , or from the Turkish military and naval rank miralay . The French version - amiral without the additional d - tends to add evidence for the Arab origin . In the Commonwealth nations and the United States , a full admiral is equivalent to a full general in the army , and is above vice admiral and below admiral of the fleet , or fleet admiral . In NATO , admirals have a rank code of OF-9 as a four-star rank .",

  "/wiki/Workhouse": "In England and Wales , a workhouse ( Welsh : tloty ) was a total institution where those unable to support themselves were offered accommodation and employment . ( In Scotland , they were usually known as poorhouses . ) The earliest known use of the term workhouse is from 1631 , in an account by the mayor of Abingdon reporting that wee haue erected wthn our borough a workehouse to sett poore people to worke . The origins of the workhouse can be traced to the Poor Law Act of 1388 , which attempted to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers , and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor . However , mass unemployment following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular , and a series of bad harvests , meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable . The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse . Some Poor Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates , who generally lacked the skills or motivation to compete in the open market [ citation needed ] . Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones , crushing bones to produce fertiliser , or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike , perhaps the origin of the nickname the spike for a workhouse . As the 19th century wore on , workhouses increasingly became refuges for the elderly , infirm and sick rather than the able-bodied poor , and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals . Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930 , many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions under the control of local authorities . It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared , and with them the workhouses .",

A normal heraldic achievement consists of the shield , above which is set the helm , on which sits the crest , its base encircled by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse . The use of the crest and torse independently from the rest of the achievement , a practice which became common in the era of paper heraldry , has led the term crest to be frequently but erroneously used to refer to the arms displayed on the shield , or to the achievement as a whole .",

  "/wiki/Cast_iron": "Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2% . Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature . The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured : white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through , grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks , and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite nodules which stop the crack from further progressing . Carbon ( C ) ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt% , and silicon ( Si ) 1-3 wt% , are the main alloying elements of cast iron . Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel . Cast iron tends to be brittle , except for malleable cast irons . With its relatively low melting point , good fluidity , castability , excellent machinability , resistance to deformation and wear resistance , cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes , machines and automotive industry parts , such as cylinder heads , cylinder blocks and gearbox cases . It is resistant to damage by oxidation . The earliest cast-iron artefacts date to the 5th century BC , and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu in China . Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare , agriculture , and architecture . During the 15th century , cast iron became utilized for cannon in Burgundy , France , and in England during the Reformation . The amounts of cast iron used for cannon required large scale production ."
