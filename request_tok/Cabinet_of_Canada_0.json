  "/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada": "The prime minister of Canada ( French : premier ministre du Canada ) is the primary Minister of the Crown , chair of the Cabinet , and Canada 's head of government . The current , and 23rd , prime minister of Canada is the Liberal Party 's Justin Trudeau , following the 2019 Canadian federal election . Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable ( French : Le Tr\u00e8s Honorable ) , a privilege maintained for life . The prime minister of Canada is in charge of the Prime Minister 's Office . The prime minister also chooses the ministers who make up the Cabinet . The two groups , with the authority of the Parliament of Canada , manage the Government of Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces . The Cabinet and the prime minister also appoint members of the Senate of Canada , the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada and other federal courts , and the leaders and boards , as required under law , of various Crown Corporations , and selects the governor general of Canada . Under the Canadian constitution , all of the power to exercise these activities is actually vested in the monarch of Canada , but in practice the monarch ( who is the head of state ) or her representative , the governor general of Canada , approves them routinely , and their role is largely ceremonial , and their powers are only exercised under the advice of the prime minister . Not outlined in any constitutional document , the office exists only as per long-established convention ( originating in Canada 's former colonial power , the United Kingdom ) that stipulates the monarch 's representative , the governor general , must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber .
