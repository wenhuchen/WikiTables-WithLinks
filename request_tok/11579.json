  "/wiki/Burra_Burra_Mine_(Ducktown,_Tennessee)": "The Burra Burra Mine is a copper mine located in Ducktown , Tennessee , in the southeastern United States . Named for the famous mine in Australia , the Burra Burra Mine extracted over 15 million tons ( 14 million metric tons ) of copper ore during its 60 years of operation between 1899 and 1959 . The mine 's remaining structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Burra Burra Mine Historic District . The site is also home to the Ducktown Basin Museum , and the museum and mine are a Tennessee State Historic Site operated in partnership with the Tennessee Historical Commission . The Burra Burra Mine was one of a number of mining operations in the Copper Basin from 1850 to 1987 that produced substantial amounts of copper ore that contained sulfur . Trees were cut to smelt the ore and burn off the sulfur . Both the tree-harvesting and the sulfuric acid pollution left more than 32,000 acres ( 50 sq mi ) - ( 13,000 hectares ( 130 km2 ) - of the basin eroded and virtually devoid of life , though the area has begun to recover after decades of re-greening efforts .",

  "/wiki/Copperhill,_Tennessee": "Copperhill is a city in Polk County , Tennessee , United States . The population was 354 at the 2010 census . It is included in the Cleveland Metropolitan Statistical Area . Starting around the time of the Civil War , the production method for removing the Sulphur from the copper ore mined in the area required building bonfires , throwing in the ore , and burning off the Sulphur . This necessitated cutting most of the trees in the valley for the bonfires . The acid rain caused by the burning of the Sulphur inhibited additional vegetation from growing , and the topsoil consequently washed off the hilly terrain due to lack of vegetation to hold it . Though acid plants were later built to convert the Sulphur into a useful product , the result of the earlier activities was that for years , up until the 1980s , the area was denuded of any greenery , and the red clay soil remaining gave it a Martian appearance . The area has now been greatly reforested , due to a multimillion-dollar effort by the successor companies to the original copper company . The copper and acid plants have been permanently closed and most of the plant infrastructure already removed and sold overseas . Much of the scrap metals from the site have been removed and sold to China . Glenn Springs Holdings has cleaned and purified all the surrounding creeks and waterways , and water quality is now back to near pristine condition according to published EPA and Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation studies . The town these days is a tourist attraction , with near daily rail excursions from Blue Ridge , Georgia , on the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway , and near daily rail excursions from The Gee Creek Wilderness on the Hiwassee River train route .",

  "/wiki/Kimsey_Junior_College": "Located in Ducktown , Tennessee , Kimsey Junior College was originally constructed in 1933 by the Fourth Fractional Township with the intention of serving as a junior college for the region . The building is named for one of the commissioners of the township at the time its construction was commissioned . Due to the isolation of the Copper Basin from major population centers in the state , the building was never used for its intended purpose . The Kimsey Junior College building remained vacant until 1938 when Ducktown High School and Ducktown Elementary School relocated to the site . The High School remained in the building until 1956 . The elementary school remained in the facility until 2006 when an agreement was reached to consolidate Ducktown and Turtletown Elementary Schools . Although the site was more centrally located for consolidation , concerns over ownership and maintenance costs led to the decision to choose another site . The new location chosen was the old Copper Basin High School building thus the Kimsey Junior College building was vacated . In September 1992 , the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places . Since 2007 , the site has remained vacant although there has been interest expressed in the building for use as a community center , office space , and an assisted living facility . The building is still owned and maintained by the Fourth Fractional Township , one of the last remaining entities of its kind in the state . The township consists of a three-person board which provides security for the site and maintenance of the 150 acre tract the building occupies .",

  "/wiki/Ocoee_River": "The Toccoa River and Ocoee River are the names in use for a single 93-mile-long ( 150 km ) river that flows northwestward through the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern United States .

It is famous for its whitewater rapids on the Tennessee side . The river is called the Toccoa for its 56 miles ( 90 km ) through Georgia , until it reaches the twin cities of McCaysville , Georgia and Copperhill , Tennessee , at the truss bridge which connects Georgia 5 ( Blue Ridge Street ) with Tennessee 68 and Georgia 60 ( Ocoee Street and Toccoa Street ) . The remainder is called the Ocoee through Tennessee , known for its whitewater rafting , and host to whitewater slalom events during the Centennial 1996 Summer Olympics held primarily in Atlanta , about 100 miles ( 160 km ) to the south . The name Ocoee originates from the Cherokee name for Passiflora incarnata , ocoee . Toccoa comes from the Cherokee term for where the Catawbas lived or beautiful . On February 16 , 1990 flooding of the river submerged much of the central business district of the riverfront towns of Copperhill , Tennessee and McCaysville , Georgia . The area was once heavily mined for copper ore from the Copper Basin and polluted by smelting operations .
