  "/wiki/Ph.D.": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries . PhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields . As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree . Sometimes this status is also colloquially known as PhD ABD , meaning All But Dissertation .",

  "/wiki/Ota_Benga": "Ota Benga ( c. 1883 - March 20 , 1916 ) was a Mbuti ( Congo pygmy ) man , known for being featured in an anthropology exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis , Missouri , in 1904 , and in a human zoo exhibit in 1906 at the Bronx Zoo . Benga had been purchased from African slave traders by the missionary and anthropologist Samuel Phillips Verner , a businessman searching for African people for the exhibition . He accompanied Verner to the United States . Later , at the Bronx Zoo , Benga was allowed to walk the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo 's Monkey House . Except for a brief visit with Verner to Africa after the close of the St. Louis Fair , Benga lived in the United States , mostly in Virginia , for the rest of his life . African-American newspapers around the nation published editorials strongly opposing Benga 's treatment . Robert Stuart MacArthur , spokesman for a delegation of black churches , petitioned New York City Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. for his release from the Bronx Zoo . [ year needed ] In late 1906 , the mayor released Benga to the custody of James M. Gordon , who supervised the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn . In 1910 , Gordon arranged for Benga to be cared for in Lynchburg , Virginia , where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth capped . This would enable the young man to be more readily accepted in local society . Benga was tutored in English and began to work at a Lynchburg tobacco factory . He began to plan a return to Africa , but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 stopped all ship passenger travel .",
