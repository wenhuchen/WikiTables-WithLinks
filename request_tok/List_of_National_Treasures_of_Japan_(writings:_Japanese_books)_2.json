The Nihon Shoki focuses on the merits of the virtuous rulers as well as the errors of the bad rulers . It describes episodes from mythological eras and diplomatic contacts with other countries . The Nihon Shoki was written in classical Chinese , as was common for official documents at that time .

  "/wiki/Kuge": "The kuge ( \u516c\u5bb6 ) was a Japanese aristocratic class that dominated the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto . The kuge were important from the establishment of Kyoto as the capital during the Heian period in the late 8th century until the rise of the Kamakura shogunate in the 12th century , at which point it was eclipsed by the bushi . The kuge still provided a weak court around the Emperor until the Meiji Restoration , when they merged with the daimy\u014d , regaining some of their status in the process , and formed the kazoku ( peerage ) , which lasted until shortly after World War II ( 1947 ) , when the Japanese peerage system was abolished . Though there is no longer an official status , members of the kuge families remain influential in Japanese society , government , and industry .",

It hosts temporary exhibitions on the third floor , while the permanent collections are on the fourth floor .
