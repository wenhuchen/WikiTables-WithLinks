Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death , Bizet achieved few successes before his final work , Carmen , which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire . During a brilliant student career at the Conservatoire de Paris , Bizet won many prizes , including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857 . He was recognised as an outstanding pianist , though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public . Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy , he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers . His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored ; as a result , his career stalled , and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others . Restless for success , he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s , most of which were abandoned . Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time - Les p\u00eacheurs de perles and La jolie fille de Perth - were immediately successful . After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 , during which Bizet served in the National Guard , he had little success with his one-act opera Djamileh , though an orchestral suite derived from his incidental music to Alphonse Daudet 's play L'Arl\u00e9sienne was instantly popular . The production of Bizet 's final opera , Carmen , was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences . After its premiere on 3 March 1875 , Bizet was convinced that the work was a failure ; he died of a heart attack three months later , unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success . Bizet 's marriage to Genevi\u00e8ve Hal\u00e9vy was intermittently happy and produced one son .",
  "/wiki/Carmen": "Carmen [ ka\u0281.m\u025bn ] is an opera in four acts by French composer Georges Bizet . The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy , based on a novella of the same title by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e . The opera was first performed by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875 , where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences . Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance , unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years . Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon ; the Habanera from act 1 and the Toreador Song from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias . The opera is written in the genre of op\u00e9ra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue . It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don Jos\u00e9 , a na\u00efve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen . Jos\u00e9 abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties , yet loses Carmen 's love to the glamorous torero Escamillo , after which Jos\u00e9 kills her in a jealous rage . The depictions of proletarian life , immorality , and lawlessness , and the tragic death of the main character on stage , broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial . After the premiere , most reviews were critical , and the French public was generally indifferent . Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France , and was not revived in Paris until 1883 . Thereafter , it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad .",

Along with Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini , Donizetti was a leading composer of the bel canto opera style during the first half of the nineteenth century . Donizetti 's close association with the bel canto style was undoubtedly an influence on other composers such as Giuseppe Verdi . Donizetti was born in Bergamo in Lombardy . Although he did not come from a musical background , at an early age he was taken under the wing of composer Simon Mayr who had enrolled him by means of a full scholarship in a school which he had set up . There he received detailed training in the arts of fugue and counterpoint . Mayr was also instrumental in obtaining a place for the young man at the Bologna Academy , where , at the age of 19 , he wrote his first one-act opera , the comedy Il Pigmalione , which may never have been performed during his lifetime . Over the course of his career , Donizetti wrote almost 70 operas . An offer in 1822 from Domenico Barbaja , the impresario of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples , which followed the composer 's ninth opera , led to his move to that city and his residency there which lasted until the production of Caterina Cornaro in January 1844 . In all , Naples presented 51 of Donizetti 's operas .",
  "/wiki/Lucia_di_Lammermoor": "Lucia di Lammermoor is a dramma tragico ( tragic opera ) in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti . Salvadore Cammarano wrote the Italian-language libretto loosely based upon Sir Walter Scott 's historical novel The Bride of Lammermoor . Donizetti wrote Lucia di Lammermoor in 1835 , a time when several factors led to the height of his reputation as a composer of opera . Gioachino Rossini had recently retired and Vincenzo Bellini had died shortly before the premiere of Lucia leaving Donizetti as the sole reigning genius of Italian opera . Not only were conditions ripe for Donizetti 's success as a composer , but there was also a European interest in the history and culture of Scotland . The perceived romance of its violent wars and feuds , as well as its folklore and mythology , intrigued 19th century readers and audiences . Sir Walter Scott dramatized these elements in his novel The Bride of Lammermoor , which inspired several musical works including Lucia . The story concerns the emotionally fragile Lucy Ashton ( Lucia ) who is caught in a feud between her own family and that of the Ravenswoods . The setting is the Lammermuir Hills of Scotland ( Lammermoor ) in the 17th century .",

His 1890 masterpiece Cavalleria Rusticana caused one of the greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the Verismo movement in Italian dramatic music . While it was often held that Mascagni , like Ruggiero Leoncavallo , was a one-opera man who could never repeat his first success , L'amico Fritz and Iris have remained in the repertoire in Europe ( especially Italy ) since their premieres . Mascagni wrote fifteen operas , an operetta , several orchestral and vocal works , and also songs and piano music . He enjoyed immense success during his lifetime , both as a composer and conductor of his own and other people 's music . He created a variety of styles in his operas : a Sicilian passion and warmth of Cavalleria , the exotic flavor of Iris , the idylls of L'amico Fritz and Lodoletta , the Gallic chiaroscuro of Isabeau , the steely , Veristic power of Il piccolo Marat and the over-ripe post-romanticism of the lush Parisina .",

  "/wiki/Rossini": "Gioachino Antonio Rossini [ n 1 ] [ n 2 ] ( 29 February 1792 - 13 November 1868 ) was an Italian composer who gained fame for his 39 operas , although he also wrote many songs , some chamber music and piano pieces , and some sacred music . He set new standards for both comic and serious opera before retiring from large-scale composition while still in his thirties , at the height of his popularity . Born in Pesaro to parents who were both musicians ( his father a trumpeter , his mother a singer ) , Rossini began to compose by the age of 12 and was educated at music school in Bologna . His first opera was performed in Venice in 1810 when he was 18 years old . In 1815 he was engaged to write operas and manage theatres in Naples . In the period 1810-1823 he wrote 34 operas for the Italian stage that were performed in Venice , Milan , Ferrara , Naples and elsewhere ; this productivity necessitated an almost formulaic approach for some components ( such as overtures ) and a certain amount of self-borrowing . During this period he produced his most popular works including the comic operas L'italiana in Algeri , Il barbiere di Siviglia ( known in English as The Barber of Seville ) and La Cenerentola , which brought to a peak the opera buffa tradition he inherited from masters such as Domenico Cimarosa . He also composed opera seria works such as Otello , Tancredi and Semiramide . All of these attracted admiration for their innovation in melody , harmonic and instrumental colour , and dramatic form . In 1824 he was contracted by the Op\u00e9ra in Paris , for which he produced an opera to celebrate the coronation of Charles X , Il viaggio a Reims ( later cannibalised for his first opera in French , Le comte Ory ) , revisions of two of his Italian operas , Le si\u00e8ge de Corinthe and Mo\u00efse , and in 1829 his last opera , Guillaume Tell . Rossini 's withdrawal from opera for the last 40 years of his life has never been fully explained ; contributary factors may have been ill-health , the wealth his success had brought him , and the rise of spectacular grand opera under composers such as Giacomo Meyerbeer . From the early 1830s to 1855 , when he left Paris and was based in Bologna , Rossini wrote relatively little .",

He was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means , and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron . Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Vincenzo Bellini , Gaetano Donizetti , and Gioachino Rossini , whose works significantly influenced him . In his early operas , Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy . He also participated briefly as an elected politician . The chorus Va , pensiero from his early opera Nabucco ( 1842 ) , and similar choruses in later operas , were much in the spirit of the unification movement , and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals . An intensely private person , Verdi , however , did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region . He surprised the musical world by returning , after his success with the opera Aida ( 1871 ) , with three late masterpieces : his Requiem ( 1874 ) , and the operas Otello ( 1887 ) and Falstaff ( 1893 ) .

In becoming the Un ballo in maschera which we know today , Verdi 's opera ( and his libretto ) underwent a significant series of transformations and title changes , caused by a combination of censorship regulations in both Naples and Rome , as well as by the political situation in France in January 1858 . Based on the Scribe libretto and begun as Gustavo III set in Stockholm , it became Una vendetta in domino set in Stettin , and finally Un ballo in maschera set in Boston during the colonial era .

Verdi wrote Falstaff , which was the last of his 28 operas , as he was approaching the age of 80 . It was his second comedy , and his third work based on a Shakespeare play , following Macbeth and Otello . The plot revolves around the thwarted , sometimes farcical , efforts of the fat knight , Sir John Falstaff , to seduce two married women to gain access to their husbands ' wealth . Verdi was concerned about working on a new opera at his advanced age , but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito 's draft libretto . It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete . Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world , Falstaff did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer 's canon . After the initial performances in Italy , other European countries and the US , the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s into the next century . Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi 's previous operas , a view strongly contradicted by Toscanini .

It was Guti\u00e9rrez 's most successful play , one which Verdi scholar Julian Budden describes as a high flown , sprawling melodrama flamboyantly defiant of the Aristotelian unities , packed with all manner of fantastic and bizarre incident . The premiere took place at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 19 January 1853 , where it began a victorious march throughout the operatic world , a success due to Verdi 's work over the previous three years . It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of Il trovatore . There followed , slowly and with interruptions , the preparation of the libretto , first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare , which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions , which were accomplished under his direction . These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora . For Verdi , the three years were filled with musical activity ; work on this opera did not proceed while the composer wrote and premiered Rigoletto in Venice in March 1851 . His personal affairs also limited his professional work . In May 1851 , an additional commission was offered by the Venice company after Rigoletto 's success there .
