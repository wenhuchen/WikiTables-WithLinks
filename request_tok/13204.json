  "/wiki/Salsa_(dance)": "Salsa is a Latin dance associated with the music genre of the same name which originated in the 1960s in New York City . Salsa is an amalgamation of Cuban dances that were popular in the ballrooms and nightclubs of Havana by the end of the 1950s ( e.g . casino , mambo and pachanga ) , as well as American jazz dances . It was primarily developed by Puerto Ricans living in New York ( Nuyoricans ) in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as Cuban , Puerto Rican , Cali Colombia , L.A. and New York styles . Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs , bars , ballrooms , restaurants , and outside , especially when part of an outdoor festival . In many styles of salsa dancing , as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping , the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes . Weight shifts cause the hips to move . Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated . Salsa generally uses music ranging from about 150 bpm ( beats per minute ) to around 250 bpm , although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160-220 bpm . The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music . The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps .",

  "/wiki/Street_dance": "A street dance is a dance style that evolved outside dance studios in any available open space such as streets , dance parties , block parties , parks , school yards , raves , and nightclubs . A street dance is a vernacular dance in an urban context . Vernacular dances are often improvisational and social in nature , encouraging interaction and contact with spectators and other dancers . These dances are a part of the vernacular culture of the geographical area that they come from . Examples of street dance include b-boying ( or breakdancing ) , which originated in New York City . Clogging is a very early form of street dance , since it evolved in the streets and factories of Northern England in the mid-19th century . Various street dances have lent themselves to the style of urban dance , which arose from the collegiate dance scene . Urban dance is choreography-oriented but is inspired by different street dance styles and fundamental moves , such as house , locking , and popping . Urban dance should not be mistaken with hip hop , the culture and art movement that began in the Bronx in New York City during the late 1970s ."
