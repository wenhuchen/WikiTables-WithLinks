  "/wiki/Bugs_Bunny": "Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character , created in the late 1930s by Leon Schlesinger Productions ( later Warner Bros. Cartoons ) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc . Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films , produced by Warner Bros . Though a similar character called Happy Rabbit debuted in the WB cartoon Porky 's Hare Hunt ( 1938 ) and appeared in a few subsequent shorts , the definitive character of Bugs is widely credited to have made his debut in director Tex Avery 's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare ( 1940 ) . Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant , insouciant personality . He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent , his portrayal as a trickster , and his catch phrase Eh.What 's up , doc ? . Due to Bugs ' popularity during the golden age of American animation , he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment , but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world . He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos . Since his debut , Bugs has appeared in various short films , feature films , compilations , TV series , music records , comics , video games , award shows , amusement park rides , and commercials . He has also appeared in more films than any other cartoon character , is the 9th most-portrayed film personality in the world , and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .",

Be vewy vewy quiet , I 'm hunting wabbits , as well as his trademark laughter . The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones ' work What 's Opera , Doc ?

  "/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner": "Wile E. Coyote ( also known simply as the Coyote ) and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . In each episode , the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner , a fast-running ground bird , but is never successful . Instead of his animal instincts , the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions ( sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg ) to try to catch his prey , which backfire comically , with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion . Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme . One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff . After he goes over the edge , the rest of the scene , shot from a bird's-eye view , shows him falling into a canyon so deep , that his figure is eventually lost to sight . This is followed , a second or two later , by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits . Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name . The Road Runner is called by such names as Accelerati incredibilus , Velocitus tremenjus , Birdibus zippibus , Speedipus rex and Morselus babyfatious tastius . Species names for Wile E. Coyote include Carnivorous slobbius , Eatius birdius , Overconfidentii vulgaris , Poor schinookiusor Caninus nervousrex .

  "/wiki/Ready,_Set,_Zoom!": "Introduction : The Road Runner is in the middle of the road , and after surveying his surroundings , dashes at hyperspeed onto a low plateau ( Speedipus Rex ) , then continues to mountain roads and leaves dust clouds everywhere . Meanwhile , Wile E. Coyote ( Famishus-Famishus ) emerges from his cave after a good-night 's sleep and is soon fully awoken by a Beep-beep . He peeks over the plateau to see the Road Runner at the bottom and strides down the vertical edge with eating utensils , in pursuit of breakfast . The Road Runner taunts his nemesis by dodging at the last possible moment , allowing the coyote to slam into the rock floor . The chase moves to the real roads , and the Road Runner taunts him with a Beep-beep before blasting into Mach 187 , disappearing beyond the 10 mile horizon in only 6 frames of film , causing Wile E. 's entire jaw to hang open and then drop out as he enters a cloud . The coyote trails dust as he reclines on a low rock to dream his next plan . 1 . Wile E. covers an entire section of a canyon with glue , making sure to leave space for himself to stand . However , the approaching Beep-beep belongs to a truck and not the Road Runner , and thus the coyote lacks sufficient time to escape the glue ; he tries anyway and can not leap far enough before he gets stuck , and can only watch as he is flattened . Wile E. thus tries another method : covering a low rockface with glue and preparing , from a distance , to throw dynamite at the Road Runner . However , the bird 's velocity causes the glue to part sideways , drowning Wile E. in his hiding place and preventing him from throwing the dynamite . After failing at this and at blowing out the fuse , he begins walking with his hips ( his legs are glued to the stick ) in an effort to allow the wind to snuff or slow the burning fuse , then jumps into a nearby river ; however , the explosive detonates about three feet above , and the coyote pauses in midair before he falls into the water .",
