  "/wiki/Estuary": "An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it , and with a free connection to the open sea . Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments known as ecotone . Estuaries are subject both to marine influences such as tides , waves , and the influx of saline water and to riverine influences such as flows of freshwater and sediment . The mixing of seawater and freshwater provides high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment , making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world . Most existing estuaries formed during the Holocene epoch with the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10,000-12,000 years ago . Estuaries are typically classified according to their geomorphological features or to water-circulation patterns . They can have many different names , such as bays , harbors , lagoons , inlets , or sounds , although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and could be fully saline . Many estuaries suffer degeneration from a variety of factors including soil erosion , deforestation , overgrazing , overfishing and the filling of wetlands . Eutrophication may lead to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes ; pollutants including heavy metals , polychlorinated biphenyls , radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs ; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion .",
