  "/wiki/Mii": "A Mii ( /mi\u02d0/ ) is a customizable avatar used on several Nintendo video game consoles and mobile apps . Miis were first introduced on the Wii , and later appeared on the Nintendo 3DS , Wii U , Nintendo Switch , and various Nintendo apps for smart devices . Miis can be created using different body , facial , and clothing features , and can then be used as characters within games on the consoles , either as an avatar of a specific player ( such as in the Wii series ) , or in the case of certain games ( such as Tomodachi Life and Miitopia ) , portrayed as characters with their own personalities . Miis can be shared and transferred between consoles , either manually or automatically with other users over the internet and local wireless communications . A player can create infinite versions of them creating them on any sort of basis aka themselves , famous people , etc . On the 3DS and Wii U , user accounts are associated with a Mii as their avatar , and used as the basis of the systems ' social networking features , most prominently the now-defunct Miiverse . On the Nintendo Switch , a Mii can still be used as an account avatar , but avatars depicting various Nintendo characters are also available . However , games such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe , Go Vacation , Super Smash Bros . Ultimate and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe use Miis as playable characters . Miis are also used as profile pictures for Nintendo Accounts , and can be used in Nintendo smart device games such as Super Mario Run and the now-defunct Miitomo . They are created by way of Mii Maker ( Wii U and 3DS ) , Mii Channel ( Wii ) , or the Mii system settings panel ( Switch ) .",

  "/wiki/Racing": "In sport , racing is a competition of speed , against an objective criterion , usually a clock or to a specific point . The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time . Typically this involves traversing some distance , but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal . A race may be run continuously to finish or may be made of several segments called heats , stages or legs . A heat is usually run over the same course at different times . A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a time trial . Early records of races are evident on pottery from ancient Greece , which depicted running men vying for first place . A chariot race is described in Homer 's Iliad .",
  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",
  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Americas": "The Americas ( also collectively called America ; French : Am\u00e9rique , Dutch : Amerika , Spanish and Portuguese : Am\u00e9rica ) comprise the totality of the continents of North and South America . Together , they make up most of the land in Earth 's western hemisphere and comprise the New World . Along with their associated islands , they cover 8% of Earth 's total surface area and 28.4% of its land area . The topography is dominated by the American Cordillera , a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast . The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins , such as the Amazon , St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes basin , Mississippi , and La Plata . Since the Americas extend 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) from north to south , the climate and ecology vary widely , from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada , Greenland , and Alaska , to the tropical rain forests in Central America and South America . Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between 42,000 and 17,000 years ago . A second migration of Na-Dene speakers followed later from Asia . The subsequent migration of the Inuit into the neoarctic around 3500 BCE completed what is generally regarded as the settlement by the indigenous peoples of the Americas . The first known European settlement in the Americas was by the Norse explorer Leif Erikson . However , the colonization never became permanent and was later abandoned . The Spanish voyages of Christopher Columbus from 1492 to 1502 resulted in permanent contact with European ( and subsequently , other Old World ) powers , which eventually led to the Columbian exchange and inaugurated a period of exploration , conquest , and colonization whose effects and consequences persist to the present .",
