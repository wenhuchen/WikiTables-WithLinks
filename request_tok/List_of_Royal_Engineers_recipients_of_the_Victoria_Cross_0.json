  "/wiki/First_World_War": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

When Mortimer Durand , Secretary for State of India was appointed administrator of the Gilgit Agency , he opened up the region by building roads , telegraph , and mail systems while maintaining a dialogue with the Mir of Gilgit . He intended to improve the road from Kashmir through Hunza and Nagar and up to the frontier with Russia . The Mirs of Nagar and Hunza saw this as a threat to their natural advantage of remoteness . In 1890 , Durant reinforced Chalt Fort that was near the border due to the rumor that Nagar and Hunza fighters were about to attack it , and continued redeveloping the road up to the fort . In May 1891 , Nagar and Hunza sent a warning to Durant not to continue work on the road to the fort and to vacate the fort , which was on the Gilgit side of the border , else they would regard it as an act of war . Durant reinforced the fort and accelerated the road construction to it , causing Nagar and Hunza to see this as an escalation and so they stopped mail from the British Resident in Chinese Turkmenistan through their territory . British India regarded this as a breach of their 1889 agreement with Hunza , and after an ultimatum was issued and ignored they initiated the Anglo-Brusho Campaign of 1891 .

  "/wiki/Anglo-Zulu_War": "The Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom . Following Lord Carnarvon 's successful introduction of federation in Canada , it was thought that similar political effort , coupled with military campaigns , might succeed with the African kingdoms , tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa . In 1874 , Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being . Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army . Frere , on his own initiative , without the approval of the British government [ d ] and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu , had presented an ultimatum on 11 December 1878 , to the Zulu king Cetshwayo with which the Zulu king could not comply , including disbanding his army and abandoning key cultural traditions . [ e ] Bartle Frere then sent Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand after this ultimatum was not met . The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles , including an opening victory of the Zulu at the Battle of Isandlwana , followed by the defeat of a large Zulu army at Rorke 's Drift by a small force of British troops .

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war .

  "/wiki/St_Nazaire_Raid": "The St Nazaire Raid or Operation Chariot was a British amphibious attack on the heavily defended Normandie dry dock at St Nazaire in German-occupied France during the Second World War . The operation was undertaken by the Royal Navy and British Commandos under the auspices of Combined Operations Headquarters on 28 March 1942 . St Nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs , such as Tirpitz , sister ship of Bismarck , to return to home waters by running the gauntlet of the Home Fleet of the Royal Navy and other British forces , via the English Channel or the GIUK gap . The obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown , accompanied by 18 smaller craft , crossed the English Channel to the Atlantic coast of France and was rammed into the Normandie dock gates . The ship had been packed with delayed-action explosives , well-hidden within a steel and concrete case , that detonated later that day , putting the dock out of service until 1948 . A force of commandos landed to destroy machinery and other structures . German gunfire sank , set ablaze , or immobilised virtually all the small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England . The commandos fought their way through the town to escape overland but many surrendered when they ran out of ammunition or were surrounded by the Wehrmacht defending Saint-Nazaire . Of the 611 men who undertook the raid , 228 returned to Britain , 169 were killed and 215 became prisoners of war . German casualties included over 360 dead , some of whom were killed after the raid when Campbeltown exploded . To recognise their bravery , 89 members of the raiding party were awarded decorations , including five Victoria Crosses .

The immediate cause of the war involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land , which was a part of the Ottoman Empire . The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics , while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church . The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the Ottoman Empire 's expense . It has widely been noted that the causes , in one case involving an argument over a key , have never revealed a greater confusion of purpose , yet they led to a war noted for its notoriously incompetent international butchery . While the churches worked out their differences and came to an agreement , Nicholas I of Russia and the French Emperor Napoleon III refused to back down . Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection . Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to . When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement , Nicholas recanted and prepared for war . Having obtained promises of support from France and Britain , the Ottomans declared war on Russia in October 1853 .

The 56-kilometre ( 35 mi ) traverse took a year of fighting against the Russians . Major battles along the way were Alma ( September 1854 ) , Balaklava ( October 1854 ) , Inkerman ( November 1854 ) , Tchernaya ( August 1855 ) , Redan ( September 1855 ) , and , finally , Malakoff ( September 1855 ) . During the siege , the allied navy undertook six bombardments of the capital , on 17 October 1854 ; and on 9 April , 6 June , 17 June , 17 August , and 5 September 1855 . Sevastopol is one of the classic sieges of all time . The city of Sevastopol was the home of the Tsar 's Black Sea Fleet , which threatened the Mediterranean . The Russian field army withdrew before the allies could encircle it . The siege was the culminating struggle for the strategic Russian port in 1854-55 and was the final episode in the Crimean War . During the Victorian Era , these battles were repeatedly memorialized . The siege of Sevastopol was the subject of Crimean soldier Leo Tolstoy 's Sebastopol Sketches and the subject of the first Russian feature film , Defence of Sevastopol .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Hill_70": "The Battle of Hill 70 took place in the First World War between the Canadian Corps and four divisions of the German 6th Army . The battle took place along the Western Front on the outskirts of Lens in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France between 15 and 25 August 1917 . The objectives of the assault were to inflict casualties and to draw German troops away from the 3rd Battle of Ypres and to make the German hold on Lens untenable . The Canadian Corps executed an operation to capture Hill 70 and then establish defensive positions from which combined small-arms and artillery fire , some of which used the new technique of predicted fire , would repel German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible . The goals of the Canadian Corps were only partially accomplished ; the Germans were prevented from transferring local divisions to the Ypres Salient but failed to draw in troops from other areas . A later attempt by the Canadian Corps to extend its position into the city of Lens failed but the German and Canadian assessments of the battle concluded that it succeeded in its attrition objective . The battle was costly for both sides and many casualties were suffered from extensive use of poison gas , including the new German Yellow Cross shell containing the blistering agent sulphur mustard ( mustard gas ) .",
