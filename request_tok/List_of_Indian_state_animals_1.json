  "/wiki/Binomial_name": "Binomial nomenclature ( two-term naming system ) , also called binominal nomenclature ( two-name naming system ) or binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts , both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages . Such a name is called a binomial name ( which may be shortened to just binomial ) , a binomen , binominal name or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name - the generic name - identifies the genus to which the species belongs , while the second part - the specific name or specific epithet - identifies the species within the genus . For example , humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . Tyrannosaurus rex is probably the most widely known binomial . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753 . But Gaspard Bauhin , in as early as 1622 , had introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici ( English , Illustrated exposition of plants ) many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus . The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules , of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICNafp ) . Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes , there are some differences , both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules . In modern usage , the first letter of the first part of the name , the genus , is always capitalized in writing , while that of the second part is not , even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place . Similarly , both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text ( or underlined in handwriting ) . Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox ( named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii .",
  "/wiki/Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands": "The Andaman and Nicobar Islands , a Union territory of India comprising 572 islands of which 37 are inhabited , are a group of islands at the juncture of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea . The territory is about 150 km ( 93 mi ) north of Aceh in Indonesia and separated from Thailand and Myanmar by the Andaman Sea . It comprises two island groups , the Andaman Islands ( partly ) and the Nicobar Islands , separated by the 150 km wide Ten Degree Channel ( on the 10\u00b0N parallel ) , with the Andamans to the north of this latitude , and the Nicobars to the south ( or by 179 km ) . The Andaman Sea lies to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the west . The territory 's capital is the city of Port Blair . The total land area of the islands is approximately 8,249 km2 ( 3,185 sq mi ) . The islands host the Andaman and Nicobar Command , the only tri-service geographical command of the Indian Armed Forces . The territory is divided into three districts : Nicobar District with Car Nicobar as capital , South Andaman district with Port Blair as capital and North and Middle Andaman district with Mayabunder as capital . The Andaman Islands are home to the Sentinelese people , an uncontacted people . The Sentinelese are the only people currently known to not have reached further than a Paleolithic level of technology .",
  "/wiki/Dugong": "The dugong ( /\u02c8dju\u02d0\u0261\u0252\u014b/ ; Dugong dugon ) is a medium-sized marine mammal . It is one of four living species of the order Sirenia , which also includes three species of manatees . It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae ; its closest modern relative , Steller 's sea cow ( Hydrodamalis gigas ) , was hunted to extinction in the 18th century . The dugong is the only strictly herbivorous marine mammal . The dugong is the only sirenian in its range , which spans the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the Indo-West Pacific . The dugong is largely dependent on seagrass communities for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats which support seagrass meadows , with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide , shallow , protected areas such as bays , mangrove channels , the waters of large inshore islands and inter-reefal waters . The northern waters of Australia between Shark Bay and Moreton Bay are believed to be the dugong 's contemporary stronghold . Like all modern sirenians , the dugong has a fusiform body with no dorsal fin or hind limbs . The forelimbs or flippers are paddle-like . The dugong is easily distinguished from the manatees by its fluked , dolphin-like tail , but also possesses a unique skull and teeth . Its snout is sharply downturned , an adaptation for feeding in benthic seagrass communities . The molar teeth are simple and peg-like unlike the more elaborate molar dentition of manatees .",

The city is unique as it is not a part of either of the two states but is governed directly by the Union Government , which administers all such territories in the country . Chandigarh is bordered by the state of Punjab to the north , the west and the south , and by the state of Haryana to the east . It is considered to be a part of the Chandigarh capital region or Greater Chandigarh , which includes Chandigarh , and the city of Panchkula ( in Haryana ) and cities of Kharar , Kurali , Mohali , Zirakpur ( in Punjab ) . It is located 260 km ( 162 miles ) north of New Delhi and 229 km ( 143 miles ) southeast of Amritsar . It was one of the early planned cities in post-independence India and is internationally known for its architecture and urban design . The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier , which transformed from earlier plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American planner Albert Mayer . Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by the Chandigarh Capital Project Team headed by Le Corbusier , Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry . In 2015 , an article published by BBC named Chandigarh as one of the few master-planned cities in the world to have succeeded in terms of combining monumental architecture , cultural growth and modernisation . Chandigarh 's Capitol Complex was in July 2016 declared by UNESCO as World Heritage at the 40th session of World Heritage Conference held in Istanbul . UNESCO inscription was under The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier an outstanding contribution to the Modern Movement .

A column of pendant coarse hair hangs from the dewlap ridge below the white patch . Sexual dimorphism is prominent - while females and juveniles are orange to tawny , adult males have a bluish-grey coat . Only males possess horns , 15-24 centimetres ( 5.9-9.4 in ) long . The nilgai is diurnal ( active mainly during the day ) . The animals band together in three distinct kinds of groups : one or two females with young calves , three to six adult and yearling females with calves , and all-male groups with two to 18 members .
