  "/wiki/Halloween": "Halloween or Hallowe'en ( a contraction of Hallows ' Even or Hallows ' Evening ) , also known as Allhalloween , All Hallows ' Eve , or All Saints ' Eve , is a celebration observed in several countries on 31 October , the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows ' Day . It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide , the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead , including saints ( hallows ) , martyrs , and all the faithful departed . It is widely believed that many Halloween traditions originated from ancient Celtic harvest festivals , particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain ; that such festivals may have had pagan roots ; and that Samhain itself was Christianized as Halloween by the early Church . Some believe , however , that Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday , separate from ancient festivals like Samhain . Halloween activities include trick-or-treating ( or the related guising and souling ) , attending Halloween costume parties , carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns , lighting bonfires , apple bobbing , divination games , playing pranks , visiting haunted attractions , telling scary stories , as well as watching horror films . In many parts of the world , the Christian religious observances of All Hallows ' Eve , including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead , remain popular , although elsewhere it is a more commercial and secular celebration . Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows ' Eve , a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day , including apples , potato pancakes , and soul cakes .",
