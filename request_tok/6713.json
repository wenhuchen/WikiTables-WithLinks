June 2 ] 1882 - June 1 , 1946 ) was a Romanian soldier and authoritarian politician who , as the Prime Minister and Conduc\u0103tor during most of World War II , presided over two successive wartime dictatorships . After the war , he was convicted of war crimes and executed . A Romanian Army career officer who made his name during the 1907 peasants ' revolt and the World War I Romanian Campaign , the antisemitic Antonescu sympathized with the far right and fascist National Christian and Iron Guard groups for much of the interwar period . He was a military attach\u00e9 to France and later Chief of the General Staff , briefly serving as Defense Minister in the National Christian cabinet of Octavian Goga as well as the subsequent First Cristea cabinet , in which he also served as Air and Marine Minister . During the late 1930s , his political stance brought him into conflict with King Carol II and led to his detainment . Antonescu nevertheless rose to political prominence during the political crisis of 1940 , and established the National Legionary State , an uneasy partnership with the Iron Guard 's leader Horia Sima . After entering Romania into an alliance with Nazi Germany and the Axis and ensuring Adolf Hitler 's confidence , he eliminated the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion of 1941 . In addition to being Prime Minister , he served as his own Foreign Minister and Defense Minister . Soon after Romania joined the Axis in Operation Barbarossa , recovering Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina , Antonescu also became Marshal of Romania . An atypical figure among Holocaust perpetrators , Antonescu enforced policies independently responsible for the deaths of as many as 400,000 people , most of them Bessarabian , Ukrainian and Romanian Jews , as well as Romanian Romani . The regime 's complicity in the Holocaust combined pogroms and mass murders such as the Odessa massacre with ethnic cleansing , systematic deportations to occupied Transnistria and widespread criminal negligence .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Romania": "The Kingdom of Romania ( Romanian : Regatul Rom\u00e2niei ) was a constitutional monarchy that existed in Romania from 26 March 1881 with the crowning of prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen as King Carol I , until 1947 with the abdication of King Michael I of Romania , and the Romanian parliament proclaiming Romania a people 's republic . From 1859 to 1877 , Romania evolved from a personal union of two vassal principalities ( Moldavia and Wallachia ) under a single prince to an autonomous principality with a Hohenzollern monarchy . The country gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire during the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War ( known locally as the Romanian War of Independence ) , when it also received Northern Dobruja in exchange for the southern part of Bessarabia . The kingdom 's territory during the reign of King Carol I , between 14 March ( O.S . ) ( 27 March ( N.S . ) ) 1881 and 27 September ( O.S . ) ( 10 October ( N.S . ) ) 1914 is sometimes referred as the Romanian Old Kingdom , to distinguish it from Greater Romania , which included the provinces that became part of the state after World War I ( Bessarabia , Banat , Bukovina , and Transylvania ) . With the exception of the southern halves of Bukovina and Transylvania , these territories were ceded to neighboring countries in 1940 , under the pressure of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union . Following a disastrous World War II campaign on the side of the Axis powers and name change ( Legionary Romania ) , Romania joined the Allies in 1944 , recovering Northern Transylvania . The influence of the neighboring Soviet Union and the policies followed by Communist-dominated coalition governments ultimately led to the abolition of the monarchy , with Romania becoming a People 's Republic on the last day of 1947 .",

After a career as a diplomat , he was chosen by the Council of Regents , who at the time had power in Bulgaria , to form a government capable of negotiating peace . In contrast to his predecessor , Dobri Bozhilov , Bagryanov was known for his largely pro-Western views . He saw his mission as removing Bulgaria from the war before the arrival of the Red Army and so attempted to open negotiations with the Western Allies . He also opened dialogue with Jewish leaders in an attempt to end anti-Jewish legislation . However , the coup by Michael I of Romania on August 23 , 1944 severely damaged this plan as it ended effective Romanian resistance and allowed the Red Army a free hand to advance into Bulgaria . Bagryanov continued his drive to find separate peace , repudiating any alliance with Nazi Germany on August 26 and declaring neutrality , ending all anti-Jewish laws on August 29 ( although it was officially ratified by the new government on September 5 ) and ordering the withdrawal of Bulgarian troops from Yugoslavian Macedonia . However , Bagryanov 's insistence on neutrality , rather than declaring war on the Axis Powers , hamstrung negotiations with the Allies and he was removed from government . After the Communist-led Fatherland front came to power he was amongst those tried for war crimes by the People 's Court and executed on 1 February 1945 .

Ferdinand I was crowned a Tsar at the Declaration of Independence , mainly because of his military plans and for seeking options for unification of all lands in the Balkans region with an ethnic Bulgarian majority ( lands that had been seized from Bulgaria and given to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Berlin ) . The state was almost constantly at war throughout its existence , lending to its nickname as the Balkan Prussia . For several years Bulgaria mobilized an army of more than 1 million people from its population of about 5 million and in the 1910s it engaged in three wars - the First and Second Balkan Wars , and the First World War . Following the First World War , the Bulgarian army was disbanded and forbidden to exist by the Allied Powers , and all plans for national unification of the Bulgarian lands failed . Less than two decades later Bulgaria once again went to war for national unification as part of the Second World War , and once again found itself on the losing side , until it switched sides to the Allies in 1944 .

Appointed Foreign Minister in 1963 , Bhutto was a proponent of Operation Gibraltar in Kashmir , leading to war with India in 1965 . After the Tashkent Agreement ended hostilities , Bhutto fell out with Ayub Khan and was sacked from government . Bhutto founded the PPP in 1967 on a socialist platform , and contested general elections held by President Yahya Khan in 1970 . While the Awami League won a majority of seats overall , the PPP won a majority of seats in West Pakistan ; the two parties were unable to agree on a new constitution in particular on the issue of Six Point Movement which many in West Pakistan saw as a way to break up the country . Subsequent uprisings led to the secession of Bangladesh , and Pakistan losing the war against Bangladesh-allied India in 1971 .

Born in Kotel , Bulgaria , Bozhilov attended the Higher Commercial School in Svishtov before starting work as a bookkeeper at the Bulgarian National Bank for the Kyustendil Banking Agency in 1902 . Bozhilov worked for the Bulgarian National Bank for a total of 36 years and served at various times as its governor ( 1922-1923 , 1923-1924 , 1931-1932 , 1934-1935 , 1935-1938 , 1944 ) .

The People 's Republic of Bulgaria existed from 1946 to 1990 and it was ruled by the Bulgarian Communist Party ( BCP ) , which in turn ruled together with its coalition partner , the Bulgarian Agrarian People 's Union ( former communist ally ) . Bulgaria was part of Comecon and a member of the Warsaw Pact and was closely allied with the Soviet Union during the Cold War . The Bulgarian resistance movement during World War II deposed the Kingdom of Bulgaria administration in the Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944 which ended the country 's alliance with the Axis powers and led to the People 's Republic in 1946 . The BCP modelled its policies after those of the Soviet Union , transforming the country over the course of a decade from an agrarian peasant society into an industrialized socialist society . In the mid-1950s and after the death of Stalin , conservative hardliners lost influence and a period of social liberalization and stability followed under Todor Zhivkov . Varying degrees of conservative or liberal influence followed . After a new energy and transportation infrastructure was constructed , by 1960 manufacturing became the dominant sector of the economy and Bulgaria became a major exporter of household goods and later on computer technologies , earning it the nickname of Silicon Valley of the Eastern Bloc . The country 's relatively high productivity levels and high scores on social development rankings made it a model for other socialist countries ' administrative policies . In 1989 , after a few years of liberal influence , political reforms were initiated and Todor Zhivkov , who had served as head of the party since 1954 , was removed from office in a BCP congress . In 1990 , under the leadership of Georgi Parvanov , the BCP changed its name to the Bulgarian Socialist Party ( BSP ) and adopted a centre-left political ideology in place of Marxism-Leninism .

He became heir apparent to the three kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland in 1612 on the death of his elder brother Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations . Two years later he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France . After his succession in 1625 , Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England , which sought to curb his royal prerogative . Charles believed in the divine right of kings , and was determined to govern according to his own conscience . Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of Reformed groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters , who thought his views were too Catholic . He supported high church Anglican ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments , and helped precipitate his own downfall .

On 12 July 927 , the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were united by \u00c6thelstan ( r. 927-939 ) to form the Kingdom of England . In 1016 , the kingdom became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre . Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066-1154 , Plantagenet 1154-1485 , Tudor 1485-1603 and Stuart 1603-1707 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649-1660 ) . Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became more English in nature ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor . The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327-1377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government - in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558-1603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World .

Its territories expanded and shrank , but it came to occupy the northern third of the island of Great Britain , sharing a land border to the south with the Kingdom of England . It suffered many invasions by the English , but under Robert I it fought a successful War of Independence and remained an independent state throughout the late Middle Ages . Following the annexation of the Northern Isles from the Kingdom of Norway in 1472 and the final capture of the Royal Burgh of Berwick by the Kingdom of England in 1482 , the territory of the Kingdom of Scotland corresponded to that of modern-day Scotland , bounded by the North Sea to the east , the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the southwest . In 1603 , James VI of Scotland became King of England , joining Scotland with England in a personal union . In 1707 , the two kingdoms were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain under the terms of the Acts of Union . The Crown was the most important element of government . The Scottish monarchy in the Middle Ages was a largely itinerant institution , before Edinburgh developed as a capital city in the second half of the 15th century . The Crown remained at the centre of political life and in the 16th century emerged as a major centre of display and artistic patronage , until it was effectively dissolved with the Union of Crowns in 1603 . The Scottish Crown adopted the conventional offices of western European monarchical states of the time and developed a Privy Council and great offices of state . Parliament also emerged as a major legal institution , gaining an oversight of taxation and policy , but was never as central to the national life . In the early period , the kings of the Scots depended on the great lords - the mormaers and to\u00edsechs - but from the reign of David I , sheriffdoms were introduced , which allowed more direct control and gradually limited the power of the major lordships .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland": "The Kingdom of Ireland ( Classical Irish : R\u00edoghacht \u00c9ireann ; Modern Irish : R\u00edocht \u00c9ireann ) was a client state of England and then of Great Britain that existed from 1542 until 1800 . It was ruled by the monarchs of England and then of Great Britain in personal union with their other realms . The kingdom was administered from Dublin Castle nominally by the King or Queen , who appointed a viceroy ( the Lord Deputy , later Lord Lieutenant ) to rule in their stead . It had its own legislature ( the Parliament of Ireland ) , peerage ( the Peerage of Ireland ) , legal system , and state church ( the Protestant Church of Ireland ) . The territory of the Kingdom had formerly been a lordship ruled by the kings of England , founded in 1177 after the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland . By the 1500s the area of English rule had shrunk greatly , and most of Ireland was held by Gaelic Irish chiefdoms . In 1542 , King Henry VIII of England was made King of Ireland . The English began establishing control over the island , which sparked the Desmond Rebellions and the Nine Years War . It was completed in the 1600s . The conquest involved confiscating land from the native Irish and colonising it with settlers from Britain . In its early years , the Kingdom had limited recognition , as no Catholic countries in Europe recognised Henry and his heir Edward as monarch of Ireland ; although Catholic Queen Mary I was recognised as Queen of Ireland by Pope Paul IV . Catholics , who made up most of the population , were officially discriminated against in the Kingdom , [ citation needed ] which from the late 17th century was dominated by a Protestant Ascendancy .",

This should not be confused with the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek , which was fighting with the Allies of World War II against Japan . The country was ruled as a one-party republic under Wang Jingwei , a very high-ranking former Kuomintang ( KMT ) official . The region that it would administer was initially seized by Japan throughout the late 1930s with the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War . Wang , a rival of Chiang Kai-shek and member of the pro-peace faction of the KMT , defected to the Japanese side and formed a collaborationist government in occupied Nanking ( Nanjing ) ( the traditional capital of China ) in 1940 . The new state claimed the entirety of China during its existence , portraying itself as the legitimate inheritors of the Xinhai Revolution and Sun Yat-sen 's legacy as opposed to Chiang Kai-shek 's government in Chunking ( Chongqing ) , but effectively only Japanese-occupied territory was under its direct control . Its international recognition was limited to other members of the Anti-Comintern Pact , of which it was a signatory . The Reorganized National Government existed until the end of World War II and the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , at which point the regime was dissolved and many of its leading members were executed for treason . The state was formed by combining the previous Reformed Government ( 1938-1940 ) and Provisional Government ( 1937-1940 ) of the Republic of China , puppet regimes which ruled the central and northern regions of China that were under Japanese control , respectively . Unlike Wang Jingwei 's government , these regimes were not much more than arms of the Japanese military leadership and received no recognition even from Japan itself or its allies . However , after 1940 the former territory of the Provisional Government remained semi-autonomous from Nanjing 's control , under the name : the North China Political Council . The region of Mengjiang ( puppet government in Inner Mongolia ) was under Wang Jingwei 's government only nominally .",

Jane was the great-granddaughter of Henry VII through his younger daughter Mary , and was a first cousin once removed of Edward VI . She had an excellent humanist education and a reputation as one of the most learned young women of her day . In May 1553 , she married Lord Guildford Dudley , a younger son of Edward 's chief minister John Dudley , Duke of Northumberland . In June 1553 , Edward VI wrote his will , nominating Jane and her male heirs as successors to the Crown , in part because his half-sister Mary was Roman Catholic , while Jane was a committed Protestant and would support the reformed Church of England , whose foundation Edward claimed to have laid . The will removed his half-sisters , Mary and Elizabeth , from the line of succession on account of their illegitimacy , subverting their claims under the Third Succession Act . After Edward 's death , Jane was proclaimed queen on 10 July 1553 and awaited coronation in the Tower of London . Support for Mary grew very quickly , and most of Jane 's supporters abandoned her .

Named for its heartland in Qin state ( modern Gansu and Shaanxi ) , the dynasty was founded by Qin Shi Huang , the First Emperor of Qin . The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC , during the Warring States period . In the mid and late third century BC , the Qin state carried out a series of swift conquests , first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty , and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States . Its 15 years was the shortest major dynasty in Chinese history , consisting of only two emperors , but inaugurated an imperial system that lasted from 221 BC , with interruption and adaptation , until 1912 AD . The Qin sought to create a state unified by structured centralized political power and a large military supported by a stable economy . The central government moved to undercut aristocrats and landowners to gain direct administrative control over the peasantry , who comprised the overwhelming majority of the population and labour force . This allowed ambitious projects involving three hundred thousand peasants and convicts , such as connecting walls along the northern border , eventually developing into the Great Wall of China . The Qin introduced a range of reforms such as standardized currency , weights , measures , and a uniform system of writing , which aimed to unify the state and promote commerce . Additionally , its military used the most recent weaponry , transportation , and tactics , though the government was heavy-handedly bureaucratic . Han Confucians portrayed the legalistic Qin dynasty as a monolithic tyranny , notably citing a purge known as the burning of books and burying of scholars although some modern scholars dispute the veracity of these accounts . When the first emperor died in 210 BC , two of his advisers placed an heir on the throne in an attempt to influence and control the administration of the dynasty .",

The first part of his reign was marked by attempts to reform the French government in accordance with Enlightenment ideas . These included efforts to abolish serfdom , remove the taille ( land tax ) and the corv\u00e9e ( labour tax ) , and increase tolerance toward non-Catholics as well as the abolition of the death penalty for deserters . The French nobility reacted to the proposed reforms with hostility , and successfully opposed their implementation . Louis implemented deregulation of the grain market , advocated by his economic liberal minister Turgot , but it resulted in an increase in bread prices . In periods of bad harvests , it would lead to food scarcity which would prompt the masses to revolt . From 1776 , Louis XVI actively supported the North American colonists , who were seeking their independence from Great Britain , which was realised in the 1783 Treaty of Paris .

It was among the most powerful states in Europe and a great power since the Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years ' War . It was also an early colonial power , with possessions around the world . France originated as West Francia ( Francia Occidentalis ) , the western half of the Carolingian Empire , with the Treaty of Verdun ( 843 ) . A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987 , when Hugh Capet was elected king and founded the Capetian dynasty .

The first king calling himself Roi de France ( King of France ) was Philip II , in 1190 . France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines - the Valois and Bourbon - until the monarchy was abolished in 1792 during the French Revolution . France in the Middle Ages was a de-centralised , feudal monarchy . In Brittany and Catalonia ( now a part of Spain ) the authority of the French king was barely felt . Lorraine and Provence were states of the Holy Roman Empire and not yet a part of France . Initially , West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates , but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father 's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture , which became codified in the Salic law .",

The device consists of a tall , upright frame with a weighted and angled blade suspended at the top . The condemned person is secured with stocks at the bottom of the frame , positioning the neck directly below the blade . The blade is then released , swiftly and forcefully decapitating the victim with a single , clean pass so that the head falls into a basket or other receptacle below . The guillotine is best known for its use in France , in particular during the French Revolution , where the revolution 's supporters celebrated it as the people 's avenger and the revolution 's opponents vilified it as the pre-eminent symbol of the violence of the Reign of Terror . While the name guillotine dates from this period , similar devices had been in use elsewhere in Europe over several centuries . The display of severed heads had long been one of the most common ways European sovereigns exhibited their power to their subjects . The guillotine was invented with the specific intention of making capital punishment more humane in accordance with Enlightenment ideals , as previous methods of execution in France had proven to be substantially more painful and prone to error . After its adoption , the device remained France 's standard method of judicial execution until the abolition of capital punishment in 1981 . The last person to be executed in France was Hamida Djandoubi , who was guillotined on 10 September 1977 . This was also the last time that the government of a Western nation ever executed an individual by beheading .
