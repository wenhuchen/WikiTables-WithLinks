Founded by Mohammed Yusuf in 2002 , the group has been led by Abubakar Shekau since 2009 . When Boko Haram first formed , their actions were nonviolent . Their main goal was to purify Islam in northern Nigeria . Since March 2015 , the group has been aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . Since the current insurgency started in 2009 , Boko Haram has killed tens of thousands and displaced 2.3 million from their homes and was at one time the world 's deadliest terror group according to the Global Terrorism Index . After its founding in 2002 , Boko Haram 's increasing radicalisation led to the suppression operation by the Nigerian military forces and the summary execution of its leader Mohammed Yusuf in July 2009 . Its unexpected resurgence , following a mass prison break in September 2010 , was accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks , initially against soft targets , but progressing in 2011 to include suicide bombings of police buildings and the United Nations office in Abuja . The government 's establishment of a state of emergency at the beginning of 2012 , extended in the following year to cover the entire northeast of Nigeria , led to an increase in both security force abuses and militant attacks . Of the 2.3 million people displaced by the conflict since May 2013 , at least 250,000 have left Nigeria and fled into Cameroon , Chad or Niger . Boko Haram killed over 6,600 in 2014 .",
