  "/wiki/Apple_II_series": "The Apple II series ( trademarked with square brackets as Apple ] [ and rendered on later models as Apple // ) is a family of home computers , one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products , designed primarily by Steve Wozniak , manufactured by Apple Computer ( now Apple Inc. ) , and launched in 1977 with the original Apple II . In terms of ease of use , features , and expandability , the Apple II was a major advancement over its predecessor , the Apple I , a limited-production bare circuit board computer for electronics hobbyists . Through 1988 , a number of models were introduced , with the most popular , the Apple IIe , remaining changed relatively little into the 1990s . A 16-bit model with much more advanced graphics and sound , the Apple IIGS , was added in 1986 . While compatible with earlier Apple II systems , the IIGS was in closer competition with the Atari ST and Amiga . The Apple II was first sold on June 10 , 1977 . By the end of production in 1993 , somewhere between five and six million Apple II series computers ( including about 1.25 million Apple IIGS models ) had been produced . The Apple II was one of the longest running mass-produced home computer series , with models in production for just under 17 years . The Apple II became one of several recognizable and successful computers during the 1980s and early 1990s , although this was mainly limited to the USA . It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions , which made it the first computer in widespread use in American secondary schools , displacing the early leader Commodore PET . The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II , including the 1979 release of the popular VisiCalc spreadsheet , made the computer especially popular with business users and families . The original Apple II operating system was in ROM along with Integer BASIC .",

It used the same MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor as Apple II and Commodore 64 . Commissioned by the USSR Ministry of Radio , for many years it was a popular microcomputer in Soviet schools . First introduced at a Moscow trade fair in 1983 , the Agat was primarily produced between 1984 and 1990 , although a limited number of units may have been manufactured as late as 1993 . By 1988 , about 12,000 units were produced , over 9 months of 1989 - about 7,000 .",

Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

Development of AppleWin passed to Oliver Schmidt and is now maintained by Tom Charlesworth . AppleWin originally required a minimum Intel 486 CPU and is written in C++ . AppleWin has support for most programs that could run either on the Apple II+ or the Apple IIe . By default , AppleWin emulates the Extended Keyboard IIe ( better known as the Platinum IIe ) with built-in 80-column text support , 128 kilobytes of RAM , two 5\u00bc-inch floppy disk drives , a joystick , a serial card and 65C02 CPU . AppleWin supports lo-res , hi-res , and double hi-res graphics modes and can emulate both color and monochrome Apple II monitors ; later versions of AppleWin also can emulate a television set used as a monitor . Both 40-column and 80-column text is supported . AppleWin can emulate the Apple II joystick ( using the PC 's default controller ) , paddle controllers ( using the computer mouse ) , and can also emulate the Apple II joystick using the PC keyboard . AppleWin can also use the PC speaker to emulate the Apple II 's sound if no sound card is available ( does not work under NT-based Windows versions ) . Full screen mode is available through the use of DirectX . Features added to the latest versions of AppleWin include Ethernet support using Uthernet , Mockingboard and Phasor sound card support , SSI263 speech synthesis , hard drive disk images , save states , and taking screenshots .",

  "/wiki/Amstrad_CPC": "The Amstrad CPC ( short for Colour Personal Computer ) is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990 . It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom , France , Spain , and the German-speaking parts of Europe . The series spawned a total of six distinct models : The CPC464 , CPC664 , and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market . The later 464plus and 6128plus , intended to prolong the system 's lifecycle with hardware updates , were considerably less successful , as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000 . The CPC models ' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU , complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM . Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device , either a compact cassette deck or 3 inch floppy disk drive . The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour , green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit 's power supply . Additionally , a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives , printers , and memory extensions , was available . The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software . The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor , its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users , which was reflected by a wide selection of application software . During its lifetime , the CPC series sold approximately three million units .",
  "/wiki/Atari_2600": "The Atari 2600 , originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System or Atari VCS for short until November 1982 , is a home video game console from Atari , Inc . Released on September 11 , 1977 , it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges ( a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976 ) instead of dedicated hardware with games physically built into the unit . The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers , a conjoined pair of paddle controllers , and a game cartridge : initially Combat , and later Pac-Man . The Atari VCS launched with nine simple , low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges . The system found its killer app with its version of Taito 's Space Invaders in 1980 and became widely successful , leading to the creation of Activision and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco . By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983-84 , games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for , such as Pitfall ! and its scrolling sequel Pitfall II : Lost Caverns . Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600 , Pac-Man and E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , that became commercial failures and contributed to the video game crash of 1983 which ended the market relevance of the 2600 . Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel . In 1986 , the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backwards-compatible Atari 7800 , but these were not enough to turn things around , and ultimately it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry . Atari finally ended production of the Atari 2600 on January 1 , 1992 .",

The Master System launched in North America in 1986 , followed by Europe in 1987 , and Brazil in 1989 . A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987 , which features a few enhancements over the export models ( and by proxy the original Mark III ) : a built-in FM audio chip , a rapid-fire switch , and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses . A cost-reduced model known as the Master System II was released in 1990 in North America and Europe . The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards . Accessories for the consoles include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with a range of specially designed games . The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot , turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system and is incompatible with the 3D glasses . The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES , due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity . Though the Master System had newer , improved hardware , it failed to overturn Nintendo 's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America .

Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",
  "/wiki/Freeware": "Freeware is software , most often proprietary , that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user . There is no agreed-upon set of rights , license , or EULA that defines freeware unambiguously ; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers . For instance , modification , redistribution by third parties , and reverse engineering without the author 's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others . Unlike with free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge , the source code for freeware is typically not made available . Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by , for example , encouraging sales of a more capable version , as in the freemium and shareware business models .",
  "/wiki/Palm_OS": "Palm OS ( also known as Garnet OS ) is a discontinued mobile operating system initially developed by Palm , Inc. , for personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) in 1996 . Palm OS was designed for ease of use with a touchscreen-based graphical user interface . It is provided with a suite of basic applications for personal information management . Later versions of the OS have been extended to support smartphones . Several other licensees have manufactured devices powered by Palm OS . Following Palm 's purchase of the Palm trademark , the currently licensed version from ACCESS was renamed Garnet OS . In 2007 , ACCESS introduced the successor to Garnet OS , called Access Linux Platform and in 2009 , the main licensee of Palm OS , Palm , Inc. , switched from Palm OS to webOS for their forthcoming devices .",
  "/wiki/Nintendo_DS": "The Nintendo DS , [ b ] or simply DS , is a dual-screen handheld game console developed and released by Nintendo . The device released globally across 2004 and 2005 . The DS , an acronym for Developers ' System or Dual Screen , introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming : two LCD screens working in tandem ( the bottom one being a touchscreen ) , a built-in microphone , and support for wireless connectivity . Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP . The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network . Alternatively , they could interact online using the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service . Its main competitor was Sony 's PlayStation Portable during the seventh generation of video game consoles . Prior to its release , the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental , third pillar in Nintendo 's console lineup , meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube . However , backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to the Game Boy series . On March 2 , 2006 , Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite , a slimmer and lighter redesign of the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens . On November 1 , 2008 , Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi , another redesign with several hardware improvements and new features , although it lost backwards compatibility for Game Boy Advance titles . All Nintendo DS models combined have sold 154.02 million units , making it the best selling handheld game console to date , and the second best selling video game console of all time behind Sony 's PlayStation 2 .",
  "/wiki/Shareware": "Shareware is a type of proprietary software which is initially provided free of charge to users , who are allowed and encouraged to make and share copies of the program . Shareware is often offered as a download from a website or on a compact disc included with a magazine . [ citation needed ] Shareware differs from open-source software , in which the source code is available for anyone to inspect and alter ; and freeware , which is software distributed at no cost to the user but without source code being made available . There are many types of shareware , and while they may not require an initial up-front payment , many are intended to generate revenue in one way or another . Some limit use to personal non-commercial purposes only , with purchase of a license required for use in a business enterprise . The software itself may be limited in functionality or be time-limited , or it may remind the user that payment would be appreciated .",
  "/wiki/Nintendo_Wii": "The Wii ( /wi\u02d0/ WEE ; known unofficially as the Nintendo Wii ) is a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 19 , 2006 . As a seventh-generation console , the Wii competed with Microsoft 's Xbox 360 and Sony 's PlayStation 3 . Nintendo states that its console targets a broader demographic than that of the two others .

The Wii introduced the Wii Remote controller , which can be used as a handheld pointing device and which detects movement in three dimensions . The console runs games supplied on Wii optical discs . It also supported the now discontinued WiiConnect24 service , which enabled Wii to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby mode . Like other seventh-generation consoles it supported a service , called Virtual Console , that downloaded emulated games from past Nintendo consoles , support for online video streaming such as BBC iPlayer , and other services provided by Nintendo over the Internet . From June 28 , 2013 , Internet services were gradually discontinued ; since January 31 , 2019 , only re-download of games , system software update , and transfer of data between Wii and Wii U continued to be available , to be withdrawn at an unspecified future date . Wii Points could no longer be purchased after March 2018 , and could not be used and were permanently lost from January 31 , 2019 . The Wii succeeded the GameCube ; early models are fully backward-compatible with all GameCube games and most accessories . Nintendo first spoke of the console at the E3 2004 press conference and later unveiled it at E3 2005 ."
