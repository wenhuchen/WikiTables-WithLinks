Among notable local enterprises is the Abdysh Ata Brewery , whose products are well known throughout Kyrgyzstan . During the Soviet era , Kant and its surrounding area were home to a large number of ethnic Germans who had been forcibly relocated to Central Asia in 1941 from the Volga region when the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was abolished . Most left for Germany during the 1990s and after the demise of the Soviet Union when the factories where they had worked shut down . Several other nearby settlements , such as Luxemburg and Bergtal , still carry their German names , but retain only very small remnants of their Volga German and Russian Mennonite founders .",

The province surrounds the city , although the city itself is not part of the province , but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan . In 1825 Khokand authorities established the fortress of Pishpek to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz tribes . On 4 September 1860 , with the approval of the Kyrgyz , Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress . In 1868 a Russian settlement was established on the site of the fortress under its original name , Pishpek . It lay within the General Governorship of Russian Turkestan and its Semirechye Oblast . In 1925 the Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was established in Russian Turkestan , promoting Pishpek to its capital . In 1926 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union renamed the city as Frunze , after the Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze ( 1885-1925 ) , who was born there . In 1936 , the city of Frunze became the capital of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic , during the final stages of the national delimitation in the Soviet Union .
