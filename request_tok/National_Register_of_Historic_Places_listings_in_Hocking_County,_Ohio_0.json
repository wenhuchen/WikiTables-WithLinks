  "/wiki/Section_(United_States_land_surveying)": "In U.S. land surveying under the Public Land Survey System ( PLSS ) , a section is an area nominally one square mile ( 2.6 square kilometers ) , containing 640 acres ( 260 hectares ) , with 36 sections making up one survey township on a rectangular grid . The legal description of a tract of land under the PLSS includes the name of the state , name of the county , township number , range number , section number , and portion of a section . Sections are customarily surveyed into smaller squares by repeated halving and quartering . A quarter section is 160 acres ( 65 ha ) and a quarter-quarter section is 40 acres ( 16 ha ) . In 1832 the smallest area of land that could be acquired was reduced to the 40-acre ( 16 ha ) quarter-quarter section , and this size parcel became entrenched in American mythology . After the Civil War , freedmen ( freed slaves ) were reckoned to be self-sufficient with 40 acres and a mule . In the 20th century real estate developers preferred working with 40-acre ( 16 ha ) parcels . The phrases front 40 and back 40 , referring to farm fields , indicate the front and back quarter-quarter sections of land . One of the reasons for creating sections of 640 acres ( 260 ha ) was the ease of dividing into halves and quarters while still maintaining a whole number of acres . A section can be halved seven times in this way , down to a 5-acre ( 2 ha ) parcel , or half of a quarter-quarter-quarter section - an easily surveyed 50-square-chain ( 2 ha ) area . This system was of great practical value on the American frontier , where surveyors often had a shaky grasp of mathematics and were required to work quickly . A description of a quarter-quarter section in standard abbreviated form , might look like NW 1/4 , NE 1/4 , Sec .",
  "/wiki/Survey_township": "Survey township , sometimes called Congressional township , as used by the United States Public Land Survey System , refers to a square unit of land that is nominally six ( U.S. Survey ) miles ( ~9.7 km ) on a side . Each 36-square-mile ( ~93 km2 ) township is divided into 36 one-square-mile ( ~2.6 km2 ) sections , which can be further subdivided for sale , and each section covers a nominal 640 acres ( 2.6 km2 ) . The townships are referenced by a numbering system that locates the township in relation to a principal meridian ( north-south ) and a base line ( east-west ) . For example , Township 2 North , Range 4 East is the 4th township east of the principal meridian and the 2nd township north of the base line . Township ( exterior ) lines were originally surveyed and platted by the US General Land Office using contracted private survey crews . Later survey crews subdivided the townships into sections ( interior ) lines . Virtually all lands covered by this system were sold according to those boundaries and are marked on the U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps .",
  "/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System": "The Public Land Survey System ( PLSS ) is the surveying method developed and used in the United States to plat , or divide , real property for sale and settling . Also known as the Rectangular Survey System , it was created by the Land Ordinance of 1785 to survey land ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris in 1783 , following the end of the American Revolution . Beginning with the Seven Ranges , in present-day Ohio , the PLSS has been used as the primary survey method in the United States . Following the passage of the Northwest Ordinance , in 1787 , the Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory platted lands in the Northwest Territory . The Surveyor General was later merged with the General Land Office , which later became a part of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) . Today , the BLM controls the survey , sale , and settling of the new lands .",

  "/wiki/George_Deffenbaugh_Mound": "The George Deffenbaugh Mound is a Native American mound in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Ohio . Located northeast of Laurelville in Hocking County , the mound sits on a ridgeline ; it is 6.5 feet ( 2.0 m ) tall and approximately 50 feet ( 15 m ) in diameter . It was first excavated at an unknown date prior to 1941 ; at this time , a hole was sunk from the mound 's crest to its base , and a smaller hole was dug into its edge . The mound 's location and conical shape indicates that it is a work of the Adena culture , which was active between 1000 BC and AD 400 . Occupation of the vicinity was not seemingly limited to the Adena period ; approximately 0.3 miles ( 0.48 km ) away from the Deffenbaugh Mound is a stone mound perhaps built by the Fort Ancient culture , perhaps more than one thousand years after the construction of the Deffenbaugh Mound . In 1974 , the Deffenbaugh Mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its potential to be a valuable archaeological site .",

  "/wiki/Karshner_Mound": "The Karshner Mound is a Native American mound in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio . Located near the village of Laurelville in Hocking County , it is one of Ohio 's largest remaining burial mounds that has not been significantly damaged since white settlement . Measuring 100 feet ( 30 m ) in diameter and 28 feet ( 8.5 m ) high , it lies in the middle of a farm field , but it has never been cultivated , and vegetation on the mound has prevented erosion . Although no archaeological investigation has ever been carried out at the Karshner Mound , it is believed to have been constructed by people of the Adena culture , who inhabited the region between 1000 BC and AD 400 . This identification is based on its shape and location ; the Karshner Mound lies on the second terrace above Salt Creek , and large numbers of mounds on terraces above small streams have been found to be constructed by the Adena . Because of this identification , the mound is seen as a valuable archaeological site and believed to be likely to yield many informative artifacts if excavated . In recognition of its archaeological value , it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 .",
  "/wiki/Edith_Ross_Mound": "The Edith Ross Mound is a Native American mound and archaeological site in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Ohio . Located near the village of Laurelville in Hocking County , the mound is a circular structure that measures 40 feet ( 12 m ) in diameter at its base and 4.6 feet ( 1.4 m ) high at the center . It is constructed primarily of earth , with large stones placed on various parts of the surface . Few changes have been made to the mound since white settlement of the region ; a small depression in the northwestern corner may be the result of someone digging , but no significant damage was done . The Ross Mound is important primarily for its archaeological value . The land surrounding the mound has yielded large numbers of archaeological artifacts , and a concentration of stones on the western edge of the mound 's surface suggests that a grave or wall was once located there . The essentially pristine condition of the mound guarantees that any burials and grave goods placed in the mound at the time of its construction is still buried within . Because no systematic excavation has been undertaken of the mound , its contents and its builders are uncertain . Archaeologists are certain that it is a burial mound , but the date and culture are unknown : possible candidates for the builders are the Adena , Hopewell , or Fort Ancient cultures , and it could have been built as early as 1000 BC or as late as AD 1000 . In recognition of the Edith Ross Mound 's archaeological value , it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 ; it is one of four Hocking County archaeological sites on the Register .",
