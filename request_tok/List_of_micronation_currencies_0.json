  "/wiki/Micronation": "A micronation is a political entity whose members claim that they belong to an independent nation or sovereign state lacking legal recognition by world governments or major international organizations . Most are geographically very small , but range in size from a single square foot to millions of square miles ( Westarctica ) . They are usually the outgrowth of a single individual . A micronation expresses a formal and persistent if unrecognized claim of sovereignty over some physical territory . Micronations are distinct from true secessionist movements ; micronations ' activities are almost always trivial enough to be ignored rather than challenged by the established nations whose territory they claim . Several micronations have issued coins , flags , postage stamps , passports , medals and other state-related items , often as a source of revenue . Some of what might now be considered micronations began in the 20th century . The advent of the Internet provided the means for people to create many new micronations , whose members are scattered all over the world and interact mostly by electronic means , often calling their nations nomadic countries . The differences between such Internet micronations , other kinds of social networking groups and role-playing games are often difficult to define . The term micronation to describe those entities dates at least to the 1970s . The term micropatriology is sometimes used to describe the study of both micronations and microstates by micronationalists , some of whom refer to sovereign nation-states as macronations . Micronations contrast with microstates , which are small but recognized sovereign states such as Andorra , Liechtenstein , Luxembourg , Monaco , San Marino and Vatican City .",
  "/wiki/Currency": "A currency ( from Middle English : curraunt , in circulation , from Latin : currens , -entis ) , in the most specific sense is money in any form when in use or circulation as a medium of exchange , especially circulating banknotes and coins . A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money ( monetary units ) in common use , especially for people in a nation . Under this definition , U.S. dollars ( US $ ) , euros ( \u20ac ) , Japanese yen ( \u00a5 ) , and pounds sterling ( \u00a3 ) are examples of currencies . These various currencies are recognized as stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets , which determine the relative values of the different currencies . Currencies in this sense are defined by governments , and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance . Other definitions of the term currency are discussed in their respective synonymous articles banknote , coin , and money . The latter definition , [ clarification needed ] pertaining to the currency systems of nations , is the topic of this article . Currencies can be classified into two monetary systems : fiat money and commodity money , depending on what guarantees the currency 's value ( the economy at large vs. the government 's physical metal reserves ) . Some currencies are legal tender in certain political jurisdictions . Others are simply traded for their economic value . Digital currency has arisen with the popularity of computers and the Internet .",
  "/wiki/Aerica": "The Aerican Empire ( conventionally referred to in short form as Aerica ) is a micronation founded in May 1987 , which has no sovereign territory of its own and has never been recognized by any other sovereign state as existing . The name is cultured from the term American Empire . In 2000 The New York Times described its website as one of the more imaginative micronation sites . Its members claim sovereignty over a vast disconnected territory , including a square kilometer of land in Australia , a house-sized area in Montreal , Quebec , Canada ( containing the Embassy to Everything Else ) , several other areas of the Earth , a colony on Mars , the northern hemisphere of Pluto , and an imaginary planet . Their flag is similar to the flag of Canada , with a large yellow smiley face instead of the red maple leaf in the white square ( although the red rectangles on the sides have different side length ratios ) .",
  "/wiki/Hydrogen": "Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1 . With a standard atomic weight of 1.008 , hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic table . Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe , constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass . [ note 1 ] Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state . The most common isotope of hydrogen , termed protium ( name rarely used , symbol 1H ) , has one proton and no neutrons . The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch ( Big Bang ) . At standard temperature and pressure , hydrogen is a colorless , odorless , tasteless , non-toxic , nonmetallic , highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2 . Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements , most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds . Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules . In ionic compounds , hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge ( i.e. , anion ) when it is known as a hydride , or as a positively charged ( i.e. , cation ) species denoted by the symbol H+ . The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton , but in reality , hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex . As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically , study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics .",

Micronations : The Lonely Planet Guide to Home-Made Nations described Atlantium in 2006 as a refreshing antidote to the reactionary self-aggrandisement of so many micronations , and an extremely sophisticated nation-state experiment , as well as an entirely serious claimant to legitimate statehood . The book 's entry on Atlantium notes its espousal of progressive , liberal policies and characterises it as a secular humanist utopia . Among the causes Atlantium supports were the right to unrestricted international freedom of movement , the right to abortion , the right to assisted suicide and decimal calendar reform .

  "/wiki/United_States_dollar": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",
  "/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Avram": "The Grand Duchy of Avram is a micronation founded in the early 1980s by Tasmanian John Charlton Rudge , who styles himself the Grand Duke of Avram . The public manifestation of the Duchy was The Royal Bank of Avram which at one time operated from retail premises owned by The Grand Duke of Avram in George Town , Tasmania , and which still issues its own banknotes and coinage and platinum 1 ounce coins . This enterprise was later relocated to Strahan , on Tasmania 's west coast . Customers were required to exchange Australian currency for the Avram equivalents in order to obtain the currency . The Bank still operates today . The unlicensed nature of the Avram Bank roused the ire of the Australian government , who promptly confiscated Avram 's entire currency reserves and initiated proceedings against him in the Australian Federal Court system . Eventually , after a total of six court cases , costing the federal government some A $ 22 million , the courts ruled that The Grand Duke of Avram had not engaged in any illegal activity , and ordered the return of all the confiscated property , however some disappeared in Federal Custody and later appeared on the market . He was permitted to resume his banking practices unhindered . He has issued several sets of coins and banknotes in the name of the Royal Bank of Avram since the 1980s ( the most recent of which are dated 2008 ) and has asserted to a number of media representatives that the bank operates from a number of unspecified sites inside and outside of Tasmania . Rudge was elected as a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly , representing the Liberal Party in the seat of Lyons . He served a single term and held the position of Shadow Minister for Construction . Rudge later served as a councillor and Deputy Mayor of the municipal council of Sorell under his legal name as agreed by Justice Pierre Slicer in one of his decisions .",

While the protests that sparked the creation of the Conch Republic ( and others since then ) have been described by some as tongue-in-cheek , they were motivated by frustrations over genuine concerns . The original protest event was motivated by a U.S. Border Patrol roadblock and checkpoint that greatly inconvenienced residents and tourists . The Conch Republic celebrates Independence Day every April 23 as part of a week-long festival of activities involving numerous businesses in Key West . The organization - a Sovereign State of Mind , seeking only to bring more Humor , Warmth and Respect to a world in sore need of all three according to its late Secretary General , Peter Anderson - is a key tourism booster for the area .",

  "/wiki/Nation_of_Celestial_Space": "The Nation of Celestial Space ( also known as Celestia ) is a micronation created by Evergreen Park , Illinois , resident James Thomas Mangan . Celestia comprised the entirety of outer space , which Mangan laid claim to on behalf of humanity to ensure that no one country might establish a political hegemony there . As Founder and First Representative , he registered this acquisition with the Recorder of Deeds and Titles of Cook County on January 1 , 1949 . At its foundation Celestia claimed to have 19 members , among them Mangan 's daughter Ruth ; a decade later a booklet published by the group claimed that membership had grown to 19,057 . Mangan was active for many years in pursuing his claims on behalf of Celestia ; in 1949 he notified the United States , Soviet Union , United Kingdom and United Nations that Celestia had banned all further atmospheric nuclear tests . Later , as the space race got underway in earnest he sent angry letters of protest to the leaders of the Soviet Union and United States on the occasions that their early space flights encroached upon his territory - although he later waived these proscriptions to allow for satellite launches by the latter . While Mangan and Celestia were politely ignored by the superpowers , there is evidence that at least some others were prepared to entertain his claims with a greater degree of seriousness ; the first unfurling of the Celestian flag - featuring a blue sharp symbol within a white disc against a blue field - was broadcast in June 1958 to a television audience of millions across the U.S. , and the following day the flag was raised at the United Nations building in New York City , to fly alongside those of the member nations of that organisation .",
