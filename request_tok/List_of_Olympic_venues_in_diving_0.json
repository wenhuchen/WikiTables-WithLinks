It was the first time that the Olympic Games were held outside Europe . Boxing , the oldest combat sport , was introduced . Tensions caused by the Russo-Japanese War and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis in 1904 may have contributed to the fact that very few top ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in these Games . Only 62 of the 651 athletes who competed came from outside North America , and only 12-15 nations were represented in all . Some events combined the U.S. national championship with the Olympic championship .

This was the second time that the Olympics were not held entirely in one country , the first being the 1920 Summer Olympics , which were held in Antwerp , Belgium , with some events taking place in Ostend , Belgium and Amsterdam , Netherlands .
