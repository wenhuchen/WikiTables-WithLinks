The Territory was formed on 3 March 1962 , although the UK 's claim to this portion of the Antarctic dates back to letters patent of 1908 and 1917 . The area now covered by the Territory includes three regions which , before 1962 , were administered by the British as separate dependencies of the Falkland Islands : Graham Land , the South Orkney Islands , and the South Shetland Islands . The United Kingdom 's claim to the region has been suspended since the Antarctic Treaty came into force in 1961 , Article 4 of which states No acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting , supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica . No new claim , or enlargement of an existing claim , to territorial sovereignty , shall be asserted while the present Treaty is in force . Most countries do not recognise territorial claims in Antarctica . The United Kingdom has ratified the treaty . In 2012 , the southern part of the territory was named Queen Elizabeth Land in honour of Queen Elizabeth II . The territory is inhabited by the staff of research and support stations operated and maintained by the British Antarctic Survey and other organisations , and stations of Argentina , Chile and other countries .

From 1939 to 1979 , they formed an Anglo-American condominium , with administration jointly exercised by the U.S. and the UK . This arrangement only covered Canton and Enderbury islands ; the remaining Phoenix Islands were still claimed by the U.S. under the Guano Islands Act , but aside from Hull Island were either abandoned or remained under exclusive British control until 1979 . The United States and the United Kingdom relinquished control over the islands to the government of newly independent Kiribati under the Treaty of Tarawa in 1979 and the Canton and Enderbury Islands Condominium ceased to exist . In this treaty , the U.S. acknowledged I-Kiribati sovereignty over fourteen islands , but reserved the right to military bases .

Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",

The nearest continent is almost 3,355 miles ( 5,399 kilometers ) to the northeast . The atoll is 4.6 sq mi ( 12 km2 ) , and it is located in the equatorial Northern Pacific Ocean . Its 9 mi ( 14 km ) of coastline has one anchorage known as West Lagoon . It is the northernmost of the Line Islands , and one of four American islands in the archipelago , along with Jarvis Island , Johnston Atoll and Kingman Reef . Palmyra Atoll is part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument which makes up the largest marine protected area in the world . The atoll is made up of submerged sand flats along with dry land and reefs . It consists of three lagoons separated by arms of coral reefs . The Western Reef terrace is one of the biggest shelf-reefs , with dimensions of two by three miles . Over 150 species of coral have been recorded at Palmyra Atoll , double the amount of species recorded in Hawaii . Palmyra Atoll is an unoccupied equatorial Northern Pacific atoll administered as an unorganized incorporated territory , the only one of its kind , by the United States federal government . The 4.6-square-mile ( 12 km2 ) territory hosts a variable temporary population of 4-25 non-occupants , namely staff and scientists employed by various departments of the U.S. government and by The Nature Conservancy , as well as a rotating mix of Palmyra Atoll Research Consortium scholars pursuing research .",
  "/wiki/Panama_Canal_Zone": "The Panama Canal Zone ( Spanish : Zona del Canal de Panam\u00e1 ) was an unincorporated territory of the United States from 1903 to 1979 , centered on the Panama Canal and surrounded by the Republic of Panama . The zone consisted of the canal and an area generally extending five miles ( 8.0 km ) on each side of the centerline , excluding Panama City and Col\u00f3n , which otherwise would have been partly within the limits of the Zone . Its border spanned three of Panama 's provinces . When reservoirs were created to assure a steady supply of water for the locks , those lakes were included within the Zone . In 1904 , the Isthmian Canal Convention was proclaimed . In it , the Republic of Panama granted to the United States in perpetuity the use , occupation , and control of a zone of land and land under water for the construction , maintenance , operation , sanitation , and protection of the canal . From 1903 to 1979 , the territory was controlled by the United States , which had purchased the land from the private and public owners , built the canal and financed its construction . The Canal Zone was abolished in 1979 , as a term of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties two years earlier ; the canal itself was later under joint U.S.-Panamanian control until it was fully turned over to Panama in 1999 .",
  "/wiki/Rhodesia": "Rhodesia ( /ro\u028a\u02c8di\u02d0\u0292\u0259/ , /ro\u028a\u02c8di\u02d0\u0283\u0259/ ) was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979 , equivalent in territory to modern Zimbabwe . Rhodesia was the de facto successor state to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia , which had been self-governing since achieving responsible government in 1923 . A landlocked nation , Rhodesia was bordered by South Africa to the south , Bechuanaland ( later Botswana ) to the southwest , Zambia to the northwest , and Mozambique ( a Portuguese province until 1975 ) to the east . In the late 19th century , the territory north of the Transvaal was chartered to the British South Africa Company , led by Cecil Rhodes . Rhodes and his Pioneer Column marched north in 1890 , acquiring a huge block of territory that the company would rule until the early 1920s . In 1923 , the company 's charter was revoked , and Southern Rhodesia attained self-government and established a legislature . Between 1953 and 1963 , Southern Rhodesia was joined with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland . The decolonisation of Africa in the early 1960s alarmed a significant proportion of Rhodesia 's white population . In an effort to delay the transition to black majority rule , Rhodesia 's predominantly white government issued its own Unilateral Declaration of Independence ( UDI ) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 . ( The government of the United Kingdom supported Rhodesia 's transition to a multiracial democracy . ) The UDI administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the Commonwealth of Nations , but reconstituted itself as a republic in 1970 . The Rhodesian Bush War , which pitted the government against two African nationalist organisations , ZANU and ZAPU , intensified in the 1970s , prompting Rhodesian premier Ian Smith to concede to multiracial democracy in 1978 .",

It is bordered by Poland to the north , Ukraine to the east , Hungary to the south , Austria to the southwest , and the Czech Republic to the northwest . Slovakia 's territory spans about 49,000 square kilometres ( 19,000 sq mi ) and is mostly mountainous . The population is over 5.6 million and consists mostly of Slovaks . The capital and largest city is Bratislava , and the second-largest city is Ko\u0161ice . The official language is Slovak . The Slavs arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries .

In the 10th century , after the dissolution of Great Moravia , the territory was integrated into the Principality of Hungary , which would become the Kingdom of Hungary in 1000 . In 1241 and 1242 , much of the territory was destroyed by the Mongols during their invasion of Central and Eastern Europe . The area was recovered largely thanks to B\u00e9la IV of Hungary who also settled Germans who became an important ethnic group in the area , especially in what are today parts of central and eastern Slovakia .

During the August Revolution following World War II , Vietnamese communist revolutionary H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh , leader of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh , declared independence from French Indochina on 2 September 1945 , announcing the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam . The Vi\u1ec7t Minh ( League for the Independence of Vietnam ) was a coalition of multiple Vietnamese nationalist groups , mostly led by communists who increasingly marginalized non-communists in the organisation after the reestablishment of the previously banned Communist Party of Vietnam in February 1951 . France moved in to reassert its colonial dominance over Vietnam which led to the First Indochina War in December 1946 , a bloody guerrilla war between France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh . The Vi\u1ec7t Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas in Vietnam which led to French defeat in 1954 . The negotiations in the Geneva Conference that year ended the war and recognized Vietnamese independence . The Geneva Accords provisionally divided the country into a northern and a southern zone along the 17th parallel , stipulating general elections in July 1956 to bring about the unification of Viet-Nam . The northern zone was controlled by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and became commonly called North Vietnam , while the southern zone , under control of the French-established State of Vietnam was commonly called South Vietnam . Supervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India , Canada , and Poland . The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords and stated that it shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly . In July 1955 , the prime minister of the State of Vietnam , Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m , announced that South Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country . He said that the State of Vietnam had not signed the Geneva Accords and was therefor not bound by it .",

It was also referred to as Democratic Yemen or Yemen ( Aden ) . South Yemen 's origins can be traced to 1874 with the creation of the British colony of Aden and the Aden Protectorate , which consisted of two-thirds of the present-day Yemen . However , Aden became a province within the British Raj in 1937 . After the collapse of Aden Protectorate , a state of emergency was declared in 1963 when the National Liberation Front ( NLF ) and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen ( FLOSY ) rebelled against British rule . The Federation of South Arabia and the Protectorate of South Arabia merged to become the People 's Republic of Southern Yemen on 30 November 1967 and became a Marxist-Leninist one-party state in 1970 supported by the Soviet Union . It was the only communist state to be established in the Arab world . Despite its efforts to bring stability into the region , it was involved in a brief civil war in 1986 . With the collapse of communism , South Yemen was unified with the Yemen Arab Republic ( commonly known as North Yemen ) on 22 May 1990 , to form the present-day Yemen . After four years , however , South Yemen declared its secession from the north , which resulted in the north occupying south Yemen and the 1994 civil war . Another attempt to restore South Yemen ( as only a country , not a socialist state ) with the Southern Transitional Council as its new government continues on since 2017 ."
