The Canary Islands , which are also known informally as the Canaries , are among the outermost regions ( OMR ) of the European Union proper . It is also one of eight regions with special consideration of historical nationality as recognized by the Spanish Government . The Canary Islands belong to the African Plate like the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla , the two on the African mainland . The eight main islands are ( from largest to smallest in area ) Tenerife , Fuerteventura , Gran Canaria , Lanzarote , La Palma , La Gomera , El Hierro and La Graciosa . The archipelago includes many smaller islands and islets : Alegranza , Isla de Lobos , Monta\u00f1a Clara , Roque del Oeste and Roque del Este . It also includes a series of adjacent roques ( those of Salmor , Fasnia , Bonanza , Garachico and Anaga ) . In ancient times , the island chain was often referred to as the Fortunate Isles . The Canary Islands are the most southerly region of Spain and the largest and most populated archipelago of Macaronesia . Historically , the Canary Islands have been considered a bridge between four continents : Africa , North America , South America and Europe . The Canary Islands currently have a population of 2,127,685 inhabitants and a density of 283.08 inhabitants/km\u00b2 , being the eighth most populous autonomous community . The population of the archipelago is mostly concentrated in the two capital islands , around 43% on the island of Tenerife and 40% on the island of Gran Canaria .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",

The department status of Mayotte is recent and the region remains , by a significant margin , the poorest in France . Mayotte is nevertheless much more prosperous than the other countries of the Mozambique Channel , making it a major destination for illegal immigration . Mayotte 's area is 374 square kilometres ( 144 sq mi ) and , with its 270,372 people according to January 2019 official estimates , is very densely populated at 723 per km2 ( 1,872 per sq mi ) .
