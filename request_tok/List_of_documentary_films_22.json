Historically , ancient peoples who inhabited Iraq were the Sumerians and Babylonians to the south , Akkadians in the central-south and Assyrians to the north of the country . An Arab population has been present in the country as early as the second or third century BC , about four centuries before the Islamic conquest in the seventh century . The earliest known recorded language in history is the Sumerian language , originating in southern Iraq ( Sumer-Babylonia ) . During the third millennium BC , a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians of the south and the Akkadians to further north in central Mesopotamia , in which there was very widespread bilingualism of both peoples able to speak the Sumerian and Akkadian languages .

The pre-Islamic people of Iraq included people from various ethnic groups in Mesopotamia ; and the majority of them spoke the Syriac language , despite not all being ethnic Syriacs , Assyrians or Christians . Syriac Christianity first emerged in Upper Mesopotamia and the Nestorian Church ( Church of the East ) and its successor churches were established in the major ancient Mesopotamian Greek-Persian city of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in central-southern Iraq . The first Arab kingdom outside Arabia was established in Northern Iraq in the second century and was called the Kingdom of Araba .",

  "/wiki/The_Voyage_that_Shook_the_World": "The Voyage That Shook The World is a 2009 dramatised documentary film commissioned by Creation Ministries International , a Christian Young Earth creationist organisation , and produced by Fathom Media . It was released to mark the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his seminal work On the Origin of Species . A historian featured in the film has stated that the creationist backing of the film had been concealed when he agreed to take part , that the editing of his words could give a false impression of his views , and that the film presents a historically distorted portrait of Darwin . Creation Ministries agreed that they had set up a front company to approach experts . They denied any deception and stated that one of the interviewees had admitted that while the producers choose comments they did n't distort what we said , and compared their approach to that used by the BBC in making documentaries . The three historians featured in the film subsequently issued a statement that they had been misrepresented by the film company 's selective reconstruction of Darwin 's voyage . CMI countered these claims with extended quotes from the interviews of the historians . Their response was described as appearing to be sound in specific aspects by American skeptic Jim Lippard , who had not seen the film at that time . Having seen the film , he described it as trying to hide its own creationism , which becomes increasingly apparent as the film progresses .",
