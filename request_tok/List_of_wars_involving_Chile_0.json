  "/wiki/Spanish_American_wars_of_independence": "The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America with the aim of political independence that took place during the early 19th century , shortly after the French invasion of Spain in 1807 during Europe 's Napoleonic Wars . Although there has been research on the idea of a separate Spanish American ( creole ) identity separate from that of Iberia , political independence was not initially the aim of most Spanish Americans , nor was it necessarily inevitable . With the restoration of Ferdinand VII in 1814 , the King rejected any type of Popular sovereignty ( Junta or Cortes ) . The Liberal Triennium of 1820 also did not change the position of the C\u00e1diz constitution of 1812 against separatism , while Latin Americans were increasingly radicalized seeking political independence . The violent conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito in opposing the government of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville . In 1810 , numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas when the Central Junta fell to the French invasion . Although various regions of Spanish America objected to many crown policies , there was little interest in outright independence ; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French . While some Spanish Americans believed that independence was necessary , most who initially supported the creation of the new governments saw them as a means to preserve the region 's autonomy from the French . Over the course of the next decade , the political instability in Spain and the absolutist restoration under Ferdinand VII convinced many Spanish Americans of the need to formally establish independence from the mother country . These conflicts were fought both as irregular warfare and conventional warfare . These wars began as localized Civil Wars that later spread and expanded to promote general independence from Spanish rule . This independence led to the development of new national boundaries based on the colonial provinces , which would form the future independent countries that constitute contemporary Latin America during the early 19th century .",

It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) of Antarctica under the Chilean Antarctic Territory . [ nb 3 ] , The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper and lithium . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil .",
  "/wiki/Gran_Colombia": "Gran Colombia ( Spanish pronunciation : [ \u02c8\u0261\u027ea\u014b ko\u02c8lombja ] ( listen ) , Greater Colombia ) is the name historians use to refer to the state that encompassed much of northern South America and part of southern Central America from 1819 to 1831 . The state included the territories of present-day Colombia , Ecuador , Panama and Venezuela , and parts of northern Peru , western Guyana and northwestern Brazil . The term Gran Colombia is used historiographically to distinguish it from the current Republic of Colombia , which is also the official name of the former state . At the time of its creation , Gran Colombia was the most prestigious country in Spanish America . John Quincy Adams , then Secretary of State and future president of the United States , claimed it to be one of the most powerful nations on the planet . This prestige , added to the figure of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , attracted to the nation unionist ideas of independence movements in Cuba , the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico , which sought to form an associated state with the republic . But international recognition of the legitimacy of the Gran Colombian state ran afoul of European opposition to the independence of states in the Americas . Austria , France , and Russia only recognized independence in the Americas if the new states accepted monarchs from European dynasties . In addition , Colombia and the international powers disagreed over the extension of the Colombian territory and its boundaries . Gran Colombia was proclaimed through the Fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia , issued during the Congress of Angostura ( 1819 ) , but did not come into being until the Congress of C\u00facuta ( 1821 ) promulgated the Constitution of C\u00facuta . Gran Colombia was constituted as a unitary centralist state . Its existence was marked by a struggle between those who supported a centralized government with a strong presidency and those who supported a decentralized , federal form of government .",

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river . At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent . Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017 .",

Although it is one of only two landlocked countries in South America ( the other is Bolivia ) , the country has coasts , beaches and ports on the Paraguay and Paran\u00e1 rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay Waterway . Due to its central location in South America , it is sometimes referred to as Coraz\u00f3n de Sudam\u00e9rica ( Heart of South America ) . Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the R\u00edo de la Plata to the Paran\u00e1 River , and finally up the Paraguay River . In 1537 , they established the city of Asunci\u00f3n , which was the first capital of the Governorate of Paraguay and R\u00edo de la Plata . Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions , where the Guaran\u00ed people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions , mainly during the 17th century . However , after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish territories in 1767 , Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony , with few urban centers and settlers . Following independence from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century , Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist , isolationist and protectionist policies . This period ended with the disastrous Paraguayan War , during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25-33% of its territory to the Triple Alliance of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay . In the 20th century , Paraguay faced another major international conflict - the Chaco War - against Bolivia , from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious . Afterwards , the country entered a period of military dictatorships , ending with the 35 year regime of Alfredo Stroessner that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup .",

It was the easternmost territory of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata . After decades of disputes over the territories , the 1777 First Treaty of San Ildefonso settled the division between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire : the southern part was to be held by the Spanish Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata and the northern territories by the Portuguese Capitania de S\u00e3o Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul ( English : Captaincy of Saint Peter of the Southern R\u00edo Grande ) .

Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers - and many , especially in the Amazon basin , still are - many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture . The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas . Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture , others practiced a mix of farming , hunting and gathering . In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture , large-scale organized cities , city-states , chiefdoms , states , kingdoms and empires . Among these are the Aztec , Inca and Maya states that until the 16th century were among the most politically and socially advanced nations in the world . They had a vast knowledge of engineering , architecture , mathematics , astronomy , writing , physics , medicine , planting and irrigation , geology , mining , sculpture and goldsmithing .

The Spanish monarchy is currently represented by King Felipe VI , Queen Letizia , and their daughters Leonor , Princess of Asturias , and Infanta Sof\u00eda . The Spanish Constitution of 1978 re-established a constitutional monarchy as the form of government for Spain . The 1978 constitution affirmed the role of the King of Spain as the living personification and embodiment of the Spanish State and a symbol of Spain 's enduring unity and permanence and is also invested as the arbitrator and the moderator of Spanish state institutions Constitutionally , the king is the head of state and commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armed Forces . The constitution codifies the use of royal styles and titulary , Royal Prerogatives , hereditary succession to the crown , compensation , and a regency-guardianship contingency in cases of the monarch 's minority or incapacitation . According to the constitution , the monarch is also instrumental in promoting relations with the nations of its historical community . The King of Spain serves as the president of the Organization of Ibero-American States , purportedly representing over 700,000,000 people in twenty-four member nations worldwide . In 2008 , King Juan Carlos I was considered the most popular leader in all Ibero-America . The Spanish monarchy has its roots in the Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo founded after the fall of the Roman Empire .

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) .

The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas": "The overseas expansion under the Crown of Castile was initiated under the royal authority and first accomplished by the Spanish conquistadors . The Americas were invaded and incorporated into the Spanish Empire , with the exception of Brazil , Canada , the north-eastern United States and several other small countries in South America and The Caribbean . The crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region . The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the Catholic faith through indigenous conversions . Beginning with the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries , the Spanish Empire would expand across the Caribbean Islands , half of South America , most of Central America and much of North America ( including present day Mexico , Florida and the Southwestern and Pacific Coastal regions of the United States ) . It is estimated that during the colonial period ( 1492-1832 ) , a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era ( 1850-1950 ) ; the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century , and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty . In contrast , the indigenous population plummeted by an estimated 80% in the first century and a half following Columbus 's voyages , primarily through the spread of Afro-Eurasian diseases . This has been argued to be the first large-scale act of genocide in the modern era , although this claim is disputed due to the introduction of disease , which is considered a byproduct of the Columbian exchange . Racial mixing was a central process in the Spanish colonization of the Americas , and ultimately led to the Latin American identity , which combines African , Hispanic , and Native American cultures . Spain enjoyed a cultural golden age in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars . In the early 19th century , the Spanish American wars of independence resulted in the secession and subsequent balkanization of most Spanish territories in the Americas , except for Cuba and Puerto Rico , which were finally given up in 1898 , following the Spanish-American War , together with Guam and the Philippines in the Pacific . Spain 's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas .",

One of the longest-lived empires in world history , it existed for almost six centuries , from the capture of Ceuta in 1415 , to the handover of Portuguese Macau to China in 1999 . The empire began in the 15th century , and from the early 16th century it stretched across the globe , with bases in North and South America , Africa , and various regions of Asia and Oceania . The Portuguese Empire originated at the beginning of the Age of Discovery , and the power and influence of the Kingdom of Portugal would eventually expand across the globe . In the wake of the Reconquista , Portuguese sailors began exploring the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418-19 , using recent developments in navigation , cartography and maritime technology such as the caravel , with the aim of finding a sea route to the source of the lucrative spice-trade . In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope , and in 1498 Vasco da Gama reached India . In 1500 , either by an accidental landfall or by the crown 's secret design , Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil on the South American coast . Over the following decades , Portuguese sailors continued to explore the coasts and islands of East Asia , establishing forts and factories as they went . By 1571 a string of naval outposts connected Lisbon to Nagasaki along the coasts of Africa , the Middle East , India and South Asia . This commercial network and the colonial trade had a substantial positive impact on Portuguese economic growth ( 1500-1800 ) , when it accounted for about a fifth of Portugal 's per-capita income . When King Philip II of Spain ( Philip I of Portugal ) seized the Portuguese crown in 1580 there began a 60-year union between Spain and Portugal known to subsequent historiography as the Iberian Union .

  "/wiki/Americas": "The Americas ( also collectively called America ; French : Am\u00e9rique , Dutch : Amerika , Spanish and Portuguese : Am\u00e9rica ) comprise the totality of the continents of North and South America . Together , they make up most of the land in Earth 's western hemisphere and comprise the New World . Along with their associated islands , they cover 8% of Earth 's total surface area and 28.4% of its land area . The topography is dominated by the American Cordillera , a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast . The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins , such as the Amazon , St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes basin , Mississippi , and La Plata . Since the Americas extend 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) from north to south , the climate and ecology vary widely , from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada , Greenland , and Alaska , to the tropical rain forests in Central America and South America . Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between 42,000 and 17,000 years ago . A second migration of Na-Dene speakers followed later from Asia . The subsequent migration of the Inuit into the neoarctic around 3500 BCE completed what is generally regarded as the settlement by the indigenous peoples of the Americas . The first known European settlement in the Americas was by the Norse explorer Leif Erikson . However , the colonization never became permanent and was later abandoned . The Spanish voyages of Christopher Columbus from 1492 to 1502 resulted in permanent contact with European ( and subsequently , other Old World ) powers , which eventually led to the Columbian exchange and inaugurated a period of exploration , conquest , and colonization whose effects and consequences persist to the present .",

The restructuring of the Captaincy General in 1764 was the first example of the Bourbon Reforms in America . The changes included adding the provinces of Florida and Louisiana and granting more autonomy for these provinces . This later change was carried out by the Count of Floridablanca under Charles III to strengthen the Spanish position vis-a-vis the British in the Caribbean . A new governor-captain general based in Havana oversaw the administration of the new district . The local governors of the larger Captaincy General had previously been overseen in political and military matters by the president of the Audiencia of Santo Domingo . This audiencia retained oversight of judicial affairs until the establishment of new audiencias in Puerto Pr\u00edncipe ( 1800 ) and Havana ( 1838 ) . In 1825 , as a result of the loss of the mainland possessions , the Spanish government granted the governors-captain generals of Cuba extraordinary powers in matters of administration , justice and the treasury and in the second half of the 19th century gave them the title of Governor General .",

Its creation was part of the , ultimately futile , Habsburg attempt in the late 16th century to prevent incursion into the Caribbean by foreign powers . Spain also established Captaincies General in Cuba , Guatemala and Yucat\u00e1n . The Captaincy General played a crucial role in the history of the Spanish Caribbean .

Their influence once extended from the Aconcagua River to the Chilo\u00e9 Island and spread later eastward to the Argentine pampa . Today the collective group makes up over 80% of the indigenous peoples in Chile , and about 9% of the total Chilean population . Mapuches are particularly concentrated in Araucan\u00eda . Many have migrated to the Santiago and Buenos Aires area for economic opportunities . The Mapuche traditional economy is based on agriculture ; their traditional social organization consists of extended families , under the direction of a lonko or chief . In times of war , Mapuche would unite in larger groupings and elect a toki ( meaning axe , axe-bearer ) to lead them . Mapuche are known for the textiles woven by women , which have been goods for trade for centuries , since before the arrival of European explorers .

There is no precise definition of caudillo , which is often used interchangeably with dictator and strongman . The term is historically associated with Spain , and with Spanish America after virtually all of that region won independence in the early nineteenth century . The roots of caudillismo may be tied to the framework of rule in medieval and early modern Spain during the Reconquest from the Moors . Spanish conquistadors such as Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and Francisco Pizarro exhibit characteristics of the caudillo , being successful military leaders , having mutual reliance of the leader and their supporters , and rewarding them for their loyalty . During the colonial era , the Spanish crown asserted its power and established a plethora of bureaucratic institutions that prevented such personalist rule . Historian John Lynch argues that the rise of caudillos in Spanish America is rooted not in the distant Spanish past but in the immediate context of the Spanish American wars of independence . Those wars threw off colonial rule and left a power vacuum in the early nineteenth century . Caudillos were very influential in the history of Spanish America and have a legacy that has influenced political movements in the modern era . The term is often used pejoratively by critics of a regime . However , Spain 's General Francisco Franco ( 1936-1975 ) proudly took the title as his own during and after his military overthrow of the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War ( 1936-39 ) , in parallel to the German and Italian equivalents of the same period : F\u00fchrer and Duce .

As such , it represented the anticlericalist position in Chilean politics , and was instrumental in producing the theological reforms in Chilean law in the early 1880s . These laws removed the cemeteries from the control of the Roman Catholic Church , established a civil registry of births and death in place of the previous recordkeeping of the church , and established a civil law of matrimony , which removed the determination of validity of marriages from the church . Prior to these laws , it was impossible for non-Catholics to contract marriage in Chile , and meant that any children they produced were illegitimate .

The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century . The territory was colonized by Spain during the 16th century , achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia , from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 . The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador 's ethnically diverse population , with most of its 17.1 million people being mestizos , followed by large minorities of European , Amerindian , and African descendants . Spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population , though 13 Amerindian languages are also recognized , including Quichua and Shuar . The sovereign state of Ecuador is a middle-income representative democratic republic with a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities , namely petroleum and agricultural products . It is governed as a democratic presidential republic . One of 18 megadiverse countries in the world , Ecuador hosts many endemic plants and animals , such as those of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands . In recognition of its unique ecological heritage , the new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature , or ecosystem rights . It also has the fifth lowest homicide rate in the Americas .",

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) .

The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

  "/wiki/War_of_the_Pacific": "The War of the Pacific ( Spanish : Guerra del Pac\u00edfico ) , also known as the Saltpeter War ( Spanish : Guerra del salitre ) and by multiple other names , was a war between Chile and a Bolivian-Peruvian alliance . It lasted from 1879 to 1884 , and was fought over Chilean claims on coastal Bolivian territory in the Atacama Desert . The war ended with victory for Chile , which gained a significant amount of resource-rich territory from Peru and Bolivia . Chile 's army took Bolivia 's nitrate rich coastal region and Peru was defeated by Chile 's navy . Battles were fought in the Pacific Ocean , the Atacama Desert , Peru 's deserts , and mountainous regions in the Andes . For the first five months the war played out in a naval campaign , as Chile struggled to establish a sea-based resupply corridor for its forces in the world 's driest desert . In February 1878 , Bolivia imposed a new tax on a Chilean mining company ( Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta , CSFA ) despite Bolivian express warranty in the 1874 Boundary Treaty that it would not increase taxes on Chilean persons or industries for 25 years . Chile protested and solicited to submit it to mediation , but Bolivia refused and considered it a subject of Bolivia 's courts . Chile insisted and informed the Bolivian government that Chile would no longer consider itself bound by the 1874 Boundary Treaty if Bolivia did not suspend enforcing the law . On February 14 , 1879 when Bolivian authorities attempted to auction the confiscated property of CSFA , Chilean armed forces occupied the port city of Antofagasta . Peru , bound to Bolivia by their secret treaty of alliance from 1873 , tried to mediate , but on 1 March 1879 Bolivia declared war on Chile and called on Peru to activate their alliance , while Chile demanded that Peru declare its neutrality . On April 5 , after Peru refused this , Chile declared war on both nations .",
  "/wiki/Treaty_of_Anc\u00f3n": "The Treaty of Anc\u00f3n was signed by Chile and Peru on 20 October 1883 , in the Anc\u00f3n District near Lima . It was intended to settle the two nations ' remaining territorial differences at the conclusion of their involvement in the War of the Pacific and to stabilise post-bellum relations between them . Under the treaty 's terms , Chile gained control over Tarapac\u00e1 . Chile was also to retain the conquered provinces of Tacna and Arica for ten years , after which their fate was to be decided by a plebiscite . The plebiscite was never held . Finally , in 1929 , through the mediation of the United States under President Herbert Hoover , an accord was reached . Under the Tacna-Arica compromise , Chile kept Arica , while Peru regained Tacna and received USD $ 6 million indemnity and other concessions . Another important provision in the treaty said that Chile could not cede sovereignty of former Peruvian territories to other nations without asking Peru first . The Chapter has been invoked once , during the Chilean proposal of 1975 that offered Bolivia sovereignty over some minor ports . The Peruvian government rejected the proposed land swap .",

To further explain , even if the signs around the flooded parking lot say Parking Lot ( the law determining it as a parking lot ) , it is in fact a swimming pool ( due to the current practical circumstances of it being flooded ) .",

  "/wiki/Puna_de_Atacama_dispute": "The Puna de Atacama dispute , sometimes referred to as Puna de Atacama Lawsuit ( Spanish : Litigio de la Puna de Atacama ) , was a border dispute involving Argentina , Chile and Bolivia in the 19th century over the arid high plateau of Puna de Atacama located about 4500 meters above the sea around the current borders of the three countries . The dispute originated with the Chilean annexation of the Bolivian Litoral Department in 1879 during the War of the Pacific . In 1879 the Chilean Army occupied San Pedro de Atacama , the main settlement of the current Chilean part of Puna de Atacama . By 1884 Bolivia and its ally Peru had lost the war and Argentina communicated to the Chilean Government that the border line in the Puna was still a pending issue between Argentina and Bolivia . Chile answered that the Puna de Atacama still belonged to Bolivia . The same year Argentina occupied Pastos Grandes in the Puna . Bolivia had still not signed any peace treaty with Chile until the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904 . In the light that influential Bolivian politicians considered the Litoral Province lost for ever , the adjacent Puna de Atacama appeared to be a remote , mountainous and arid place difficult to defend . This prompted the Bolivian government to use it as a tool for to obtaining benefits from both Chile and Argentina . This led to the signature of two contradictory treaties in which Bolivia granted Argentina and Chile overlapping areas . The treaties were the following :",

Also called pseudo-parliamentary period or Parliamentary Republic , this period was thus named because it established a quasi-parliamentary system based on the interpretation of the 1833 Constitution following the defeat of President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda during the Civil War . As opposed to a true parliamentary system , the executive was not subject to the legislative power but checks and balances of executive over the legislature were weakened . The President remained the head of state but its powers and control of the government were reduced . The Parliamentary Republic lasted until the 1925 Constitution drafted by President Arturo Alessandri and his minister Jos\u00e9 Maza .
