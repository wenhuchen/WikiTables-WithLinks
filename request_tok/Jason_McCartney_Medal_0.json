  "/wiki/Marn_Grook": "Marn Grook or marngrook , from the Woiwurung language for ball or game , is a collective name given the traditional Indigenous Australian football game played at gatherings and celebrations of sometimes more than 100 players . Marn Grook featured punt kicking and catching a stuffed ball . It involved large numbers of players , and games were played over an extremely large area . The game was not played tribe versus tribe . All tribes consisted of two halves ( moieties ) most often represented by the totemic symbols of Black Cockatoo and White Cockatoo . The tribes would therefore merge and divide themselves into the two teams based on the moiety totems . The game was subject to strict behavioural protocols and for instance all players had to be matched for size , gender and skin group relationship . However , to observers the game appeared to lack a team objective , having no real rules , or scoring . A winner could only be declared if one of the sides agreed that the other side had played better . Individual players who consistently exhibited outstanding skills , such as leaping high over others to catch the ball , were often praised , but proficiency in the sport gave them no tribal influence . Anecdotal evidence supports such games being played all over south-eastern Australia , including the Djabwurrung and Jardwadjali people and other tribes in the Wimmera , Mallee and Millewa regions of western Victoria ( However , according to some accounts , the range extended to the Wurundjeri in the Yarra Valley , the Gunai people of Gippsland , and the Riverina in south-western New South Wales . The Warlpiri tribe of Central Australia played a very similar kicking and catching game with a possum skin ball , and the game was known as pultja .",
