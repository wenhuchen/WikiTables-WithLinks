  "/wiki/Military_Frontier": "The Military Frontier was a borderland of the Habsburg Monarchy and later the Austrian and Austro-Hungarian Empire . It acted as the cordon sanitaire against incursions from the Ottoman Empire . When created in the 16th century by Ferdinand I , the region was divided into two districts under special military administration : the Croatian Military Frontier and the Slavonian Military Frontier . Initially , the Military Frontier came under the jurisdiction of the Croatian Sabor and ban but , in 1627 , it was placed under the direct control of the Habsburg military . For more than two centuries , they would retain complete civilian and military authority over the area , up to the abolition of the Military Frontier in 1881 . During the 17th century , the territory was expanded towards the East and new sections were created . By then , it stretched from Croatia proper in the west to eastern Transylvania in the east and included parts of present-day Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Serbia , Romania and Hungary . During , this period , the defence system was also changed , from a conventional garrison model to one of 'soldier-settler ' communities . The inhabitants of the area were known as the Grenzer , or 'Frontiersmen ' . They were mostly colonists of Serbian , Croatian and German ethnicity since the native population of Croats have been largely removed from the area by centuries of war prior to the establishment of the Military Frontier . In exchange for land-grants , religious freedom and favorable tax rates , they colonized the area and served as the bulwark for the monarchy against Ottoman incursions . Germans had been recruited by Hungary in the late 18th century to resettle and develop the Danube River Valley , and became known as Donauschwaben .",

It was formed from the territories to the south of the rivers Sava and Danube , corresponding to the Sanjak of Smederevo ( or Belgrade Pashalik ) , conquered by the Habsburgs from the Ottoman Empire in 1717 . It was abolished and returned to the Ottoman Empire in 1739 . During this Habsburg rule , Serbian majority did benefit from self-government , including an autonomous militia , and economic integration with the Habsburg monarchy - reforms that contributed to the growth of the Serb middle class and continued by the Ottomans in the interest of law and order . Serbia 's population increased rapidly from 270 000 to 400 000 , but the decline of Habsburg power in the region provoked the second Great Migrations of the Serbs ( 1737-39 ) .",

The territory included only central Serbia , with the addition of the northern part of Kosovo ( around Kosovska Mitrovica ) , and the Banat . This territory was the only area of partitioned Yugoslavia in which the German occupants established a military government . This was due to the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it , and its valuable resources , particularly non-ferrous metals . On 22 April 1941 , the territory was placed under the supreme authority of the German military commander in Serbia , with the day-to-day administration of the territory under the control of the chief of the military administration staff . The lines of command and control in the occupied territory were never unified , and were made more complex by the appointment of direct representatives of senior Nazi figures such as Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler ( for police and security matters ) , Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring ( for the economy ) , and Reichsminister Joachim von Ribbentrop ( for foreign affairs ) . The Germans used Bulgarian troops to assist in the occupation , but they were at all times under German control . Sources variously describe the territory as a puppet state , a protectorate , a special administrative province , or describe it as having a puppet government . The military commander in Serbia had very limited German garrison troops and police detachments to maintain order , but could request assistance from a corps of three divisions of poorly-equipped occupation troops . The German military commander in Serbia appointed two Serbian civil puppet governments to carry out administrative tasks in accordance with German direction and supervision . The first of these was the short-lived Commissioner Administration which was established on 30 May 1941 . The Commissioner Administration was a basic tool of the occupation regime , lacking in any powers .",

Following the Italian surrender in September 1943 , the territory of Montenegro was occupied by German forces which withdrew in December 1944 ."
