  "/wiki/JFK_(film)": "JFK is a 1991 American political thriller film directed by Oliver Stone . It examines the events leading to the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy and alleged cover-up through the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison ( Kevin Costner ) . Garrison filed charges against New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw ( Tommy Lee Jones ) for his alleged participation in a conspiracy to assassinate the President , for which Lee Harvey Oswald ( Gary Oldman ) was found responsible by the Warren Commission . The film was adapted by Stone and Zachary Sklar from the books On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire : The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs . Stone described this account as a counter-myth to the Warren Commission 's fictional myth . The film became embroiled in controversy . Upon its theatrical release , many major American newspapers ran editorials accusing Stone of taking liberties with historical facts , including the film 's implication that President Lyndon B. Johnson was part of a coup d'\u00e9tat to kill Kennedy . Despite the controversy surrounding its historical depiction , JFK received critical praise for the performances of its cast , Stone 's directing , score , editing , and cinematography . The film gradually picked up momentum at the box office after a slow start , earning over $ 205 million in worldwide gross , making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 1991 worldwide . JFK was nominated for eight Academy Awards , including Best Picture , Best Director for Stone and Best Supporting Actor for Jones and won two for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing . It was the most successful of three films Stone made about American presidents , followed by Nixon with Anthony Hopkins in the title role and W. with Josh Brolin as George W. Bush .",
