  "/wiki/Glenn_Gould": "Glenn Herbert Gould [ fn 1 ] [ fn 2 ] ( /\u0261u\u02d0ld/ ; 25 September 1932 - 4 October 1982 ) was a Canadian pianist who became one of the best-known and most-celebrated classical pianists of the 20th century . He was renowned as an interpreter of the keyboard works of Johann Sebastian Bach . Gould 's playing was distinguished by a remarkable technical proficiency and a capacity to articulate the contrapuntal texture of Bach 's music . Gould rejected most of the standard Romantic piano literature by Chopin , Liszt , and others , in favour of Bach and Beethoven mainly , along with some late-Romantic and modernist composers . Although his recordings were dominated by Bach and Beethoven , Gould 's repertoire was diverse , including works by Mozart , Haydn , and Brahms ; pre-Baroque composers such as Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck and Orlando Gibbons ; and 20th-century composers including Paul Hindemith , Arnold Schoenberg , and Richard Strauss . Gould was known for his eccentricities , from his unorthodox musical interpretations and mannerisms at the keyboard to aspects of his lifestyle and behaviour . He stopped giving concerts at the age of 31 to concentrate on studio recording and other projects . Gould was also a writer , broadcaster , composer and conductor . He was a prolific contributor to musical journals , in which he discussed music theory and outlined his musical philosophy . He performed on television and radio , and produced three musique concr\u00e8te radio documentaries called the Solitude Trilogy , about isolated areas of Canada .",

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century . Stravinsky 's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity . He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario Serge Diaghilev and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev 's Ballets Russes : The Firebird ( 1910 ) , Petrushka ( 1911 ) , and The Rite of Spring ( 1913 ) . The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky 's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design . His Russian phase which continued with works such as Renard , the Soldier 's Tale and Les Noces , was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to neoclassicism . The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ( concerto grosso , fugue and symphony ) , drawing on earlier styles , especially from the 18th century . In the 1950s , Stravinsky adopted serial procedures . His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output : rhythmic energy , the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note cells and clarity of form , and of instrumentation .",

  "/wiki/BWV_140": "Wachet auf , ruft uns die Stimme ( 'Awake , calls the voice to us ' ) , BWV 140 , also known as Sleepers Wake , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach , regarded as one of his most mature and popular sacred cantatas . He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for the 27th Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 25 November 1731 . Bach composed this cantata to complete his second annual cycle of chorale cantatas , begun in 1724 . The cantata is based on the hymn in three stanzas Wachet auf , ruft uns die Stimme ( 1599 ) by Philipp Nicolai , which covers the prescribed reading for the Sunday , the parable of the Ten Virgins . The text and tune of the three stanzas of the hymn appears unchanged in three of seven movements ( 1 , 4 and 7 ) . An unknown author supplied additional poetry for the inner movements as sequences of recitative and duet , based on the love poetry of the Song of Songs . Bach structured the cantata in seven movements , setting the first stanza as a chorale fantasia , the second stanza in the central movement in the style of a chorale prelude , and the third stanza as a four-part chorale . He set the new texts as dramatic recitatives and love-duets , similar to contemporary opera . Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists ( soprano , tenor and bass ) , a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of a horn ( to reinforce the soprano ) , two oboes , taille , violino piccolo , strings and basso continuo including bassoon . Bach used the central movement of the cantata as the basis for the first of his Sch\u00fcbler Chorales , BWV 645 . Bach scholar Alfred D\u00fcrr notes that the cantata is an expression of Christian mysticism in art , while William G. Whittaker calls it a cantata without weakness , without a dull bar , technically , emotionally and spiritually of the highest order .",
