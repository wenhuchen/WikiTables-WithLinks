  "/wiki/Cheras": "The Chera dynasty ( or C\u0113ra ) was one of the principal lineages in the early history of the present day states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in southern India . Together with the Cholas of Uraiyur and the Pandyas of Madurai , the early Cheras were known as one of the three major powers ( muventar ) of ancient Tamilakam ( a macro region in south India ) in the early centuries of the Common Era . The people of the Chera country owed their importance to exchange of spices , especially black pepper , with Middle Eastern and Graeco-Roman merchants . The age and antiquity of the dynasty is difficult to establish . The Cheras of the early historical period ( c. second century BCE - c. third century CE ) are known to have had their original centre at Karur/Karuvur-Vanchi in interior Tamil Nadu and harbours at Muchiri ( Muziris ) and Thondi ( Tyndis ) on the Indian Ocean coast ( Kerala ) . The early historic ( pre-Pallava ) Chera chiefdom is often described as a redistributive economy based on kinship . It was largely shaped by agriculture , of both crops and livestock , and predatory politics . Inscriptions discovered from Karur dated to c. 1st - 2nd century CE , describe Ilam Kadungo , son of Perum Kadungo , and the grandson of Ko Athan Cheral of the Irumporai clan . Inscribed portrait coins with Brahmi legends give a number of names , such as Mak-kotai , Kuttuvan Kotai , Kollippurai , and Kolli Irumporai . Reverse of these coins often contained the Chera bow and arrow symbol . The anthologies of early Tamil texts are a major source of information about the early Cheras . The texts mention the names of a number of Chera chiefs , and the court poets who extolled them .",
