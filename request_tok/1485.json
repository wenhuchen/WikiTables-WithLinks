  "/wiki/L'Africaine": "L'Africaine ( The African Woman ) is a grand opera in five acts , the last work of the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer . The French libretto by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe deals with fictitious events in the life of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama . Meyerbeer began working on the libretto using the title L'Africaine , although his working title for the opera was Vasco de Gama at the time of his death in 1864 , before he had prepared a final version . The opera had its first performance in a version made by Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis at the Paris Op\u00e9ra ( Salle Le Peletier ) on 28 April 1865 . This version has been generally used , but some recent productions have used versions which reconstitute elements from Meyerbeer 's manuscript score and libretto .",
  "/wiki/Giacomo_Meyerbeer": "Giacomo Meyerbeer [ n 1 ] ( born Jacob Liebmann Beer ; 5 September 1791 - 2 May 1864 ) was a German opera composer of Jewish birth who has been described as perhaps the most successful stage composer of the nineteenth century . With his 1831 opera Robert le diable and its successors , he gave the genre of grand opera 'decisive character ' . Meyerbeer 's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition . These were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe and were enhanced by the up-to-date theatre technology of the Paris Op\u00e9ra . They set a standard which helped to maintain Paris as the opera capital of the nineteenth century . Born to a very wealthy Berlin family , Meyerbeer began his musical career as a pianist but soon decided to devote himself to opera , spending several years in Italy studying and composing . His 1824 opera Il crociato in Egitto was the first to bring him Europe-wide reputation , but it was Robert le diable ( 1831 ) which raised his status to great celebrity . His public career , lasting from then until his death , during which he remained a dominating figure in the world of opera , was summarized by his contemporary Hector Berlioz , who claimed that he 'has not only the luck to be talented , but the talent to be lucky . ' He was at his peak with his operas Les Huguenots ( 1836 ) and Le proph\u00e8te ( 1849 ) ; his last opera ( L'Africaine ) was performed posthumously . His operas made him the most frequently performed composer at the world 's leading opera houses in the nineteenth century . At the same time as his successes in Paris , Meyerbeer , as a Prussian Court Kapellmeister ( Director of Music ) from 1832 , and from 1843 as Prussian General Music Director , was also influential in opera in Berlin and throughout Germany . He was an early supporter of Richard Wagner , enabling the first production of the latter 's opera Rienzi .",

Today the work holds a central place in the operatic canon , receiving performances every year around the world ; at New York 's Metropolitan Opera alone , Aida has been sung more than 1,100 times since 1886 . Ghislanzoni 's scheme follows a scenario often attributed to the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette , but Verdi biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz argues that the source is actually Temistocle Solera .",
  "/wiki/Giuseppe_Verdi": "Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi ( Italian : [ d\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bppe \u02c8verdi ] ; 9 or 10 October 1813 - 27 January 1901 ) was an Italian opera composer . He was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means , and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron . Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Vincenzo Bellini , Gaetano Donizetti , and Gioachino Rossini , whose works significantly influenced him . In his early operas , Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy . He also participated briefly as an elected politician . The chorus Va , pensiero from his early opera Nabucco ( 1842 ) , and similar choruses in later operas , were much in the spirit of the unification movement , and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals . An intensely private person , Verdi , however , did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region . He surprised the musical world by returning , after his success with the opera Aida ( 1871 ) , with three late masterpieces : his Requiem ( 1874 ) , and the operas Otello ( 1887 ) and Falstaff ( 1893 ) . His operas remain extremely popular , especially the three peaks of his 'middle period ' : Rigoletto , Il trovatore and La traviata , and the 2013 bicentenary of his birth was widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances .",
  "/wiki/Un_ballo_in_maschera": "Un ballo in maschera ( A Masked Ball ) is an 1859 opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi . The text , by Antonio Somma , was based on Eug\u00e8ne Scribe 's libretto for Daniel Auber 's 1833 five act opera , Gustave III , ou Le bal masqu\u00e9 . The plot concerns the assassination in 1792 of King Gustav III of Sweden who was shot , as the result of a political conspiracy , while attending a masked ball , dying of his wounds thirteen days later . It was to take over two years between the commission from Naples , planned for a production there , and its premiere performance at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 17 February 1859 . In becoming the Un ballo in maschera which we know today , Verdi 's opera ( and his libretto ) underwent a significant series of transformations and title changes , caused by a combination of censorship regulations in both Naples and Rome , as well as by the political situation in France in January 1858 . Based on the Scribe libretto and begun as Gustavo III set in Stockholm , it became Una vendetta in domino set in Stettin , and finally Un ballo in maschera set in Boston during the colonial era . It became one of the most frustrating experiences of Verdi 's career . From the mid-20th century , it has become more common for the setting to revert to its original 18th-century Stockholm location . A re-creation of the original Gustavo III has been staged in Sweden .",

  "/wiki/Gioachino_Rossini": "Gioachino Antonio Rossini [ n 1 ] [ n 2 ] ( 29 February 1792 - 13 November 1868 ) was an Italian composer who gained fame for his 39 operas , although he also wrote many songs , some chamber music and piano pieces , and some sacred music . He set new standards for both comic and serious opera before retiring from large-scale composition while still in his thirties , at the height of his popularity . Born in Pesaro to parents who were both musicians ( his father a trumpeter , his mother a singer ) , Rossini began to compose by the age of 12 and was educated at music school in Bologna . His first opera was performed in Venice in 1810 when he was 18 years old . In 1815 he was engaged to write operas and manage theatres in Naples . In the period 1810-1823 he wrote 34 operas for the Italian stage that were performed in Venice , Milan , Ferrara , Naples and elsewhere ; this productivity necessitated an almost formulaic approach for some components ( such as overtures ) and a certain amount of self-borrowing . During this period he produced his most popular works including the comic operas L'italiana in Algeri , Il barbiere di Siviglia ( known in English as The Barber of Seville ) and La Cenerentola , which brought to a peak the opera buffa tradition he inherited from masters such as Domenico Cimarosa . He also composed opera seria works such as Otello , Tancredi and Semiramide . All of these attracted admiration for their innovation in melody , harmonic and instrumental colour , and dramatic form . In 1824 he was contracted by the Op\u00e9ra in Paris , for which he produced an opera to celebrate the coronation of Charles X , Il viaggio a Reims ( later cannibalised for his first opera in French , Le comte Ory ) , revisions of two of his Italian operas , Le si\u00e8ge de Corinthe and Mo\u00efse , and in 1829 his last opera , Guillaume Tell . Rossini 's withdrawal from opera for the last 40 years of his life has never been fully explained ; contributary factors may have been ill-health , the wealth his success had brought him , and the rise of spectacular grand opera under composers such as Giacomo Meyerbeer . From the early 1830s to 1855 , when he left Paris and was based in Bologna , Rossini wrote relatively little .",
  "/wiki/The_Bartered_Bride": "The Bartered Bride ( Czech : Prodan\u00e1 nev\u011bsta , The Sold Bride ) is a comic opera in three acts by the Czech composer Bed\u0159ich Smetana , to a libretto by Karel Sabina . The work is generally regarded as a major contribution towards the development of Czech music . It was composed during the period 1863 to 1866 , and first performed at the Provisional Theatre , Prague , on 30 May 1866 in a two-act format with spoken dialogue . Set in a country village and with realistic characters , it tells the story of how , after a late surprise revelation , true love prevails over the combined efforts of ambitious parents and a scheming marriage broker . The opera was not immediately successful , and was revised and extended in the following four years . In its final version , premiered in 1870 , it rapidly gained popularity and eventually became a worldwide success . Until this time , the Czech national opera had only been represented by minor , rarely performed works . This opera , Smetana 's second , was part of his quest to create a truly Czech operatic genre . Smetana 's musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms , such as the polka and furiant , and , although he largely avoided the direct quotation of folksong , he nevertheless created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech in spirit . The overture , often played as a concert piece independently from the opera , was , unusually , composed before almost any of the other music had been written . After a performance at the Vienna Music and Theatre Exhibition of 1892 , the opera achieved international recognition . It was performed in Chicago in 1893 , London in 1895 and reached New York in 1909 , subsequently becoming the first , and for many years the only , Czech opera in the general repertory .",

He has been regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music . Internationally he is best known for his opera The Bartered Bride and for the symphonic cycle M\u00e1 vlast ( My Homeland ) , which portrays the history , legends and landscape of the composer 's native Bohemia . It contains the famous symphonic poem Vltava , also known by its English name The Moldau . Smetana was naturally gifted as a composer , and gave his first public performance at the age of 6 . After conventional schooling , he studied music under Josef Proksch in Prague . His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising , in which he briefly participated . After failing to establish his career in Prague , he left for Sweden , where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in Gothenburg , and began to write large-scale orchestral works . During this period of his life Smetana was twice married ; of six daughters , three died in infancy . In the early 1860s , a more liberal political climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague . He threw himself into the musical life of the city , primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera . In 1866 his first two operas , The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride , were premiered at Prague 's new Provisional Theatre , the latter achieving great popularity .",

The opera was first performed by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875 , where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences . Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance , unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years . Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon ; the Habanera from act 1 and the Toreador Song from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias . The opera is written in the genre of op\u00e9ra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue . It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don Jos\u00e9 , a na\u00efve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen . Jos\u00e9 abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties , yet loses Carmen 's love to the glamorous torero Escamillo , after which Jos\u00e9 kills her in a jealous rage . The depictions of proletarian life , immorality , and lawlessness , and the tragic death of the main character on stage , broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial . After the premiere , most reviews were critical , and the French public was generally indifferent . Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France , and was not revived in Paris until 1883 . Thereafter , it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad .",

The following year , Stephan von Breuning helped shorten the work from three acts to two . After further work on the libretto by Georg Friedrich Treitschke , a final version was performed at the K\u00e4rntnertortheater on 23 May 1814 .

Bouilly 's scenario fits Beethoven 's aesthetic and political outlook : a story of personal sacrifice , heroism , and eventual triumph . With its underlying struggle for liberty and justice mirroring contemporary political movements in Europe , such topics are typical of Beethoven 's middle period . Notable moments in the opera include the Prisoners ' Chorus ( O welche Lust - O what a joy ) , an ode to freedom sung by a chorus of political prisoners , Florestan 's vision of Leonore come as an angel to rescue him , and the scene in which the rescue finally takes place .

He was a crucial figure in the transition between the classical and romantic eras in classical music and is considered to be one of the greatest composers of all time . Beethoven was born in Bonn , the capital of the Electorate of Cologne , which was part of the Holy Roman Empire . His musical talent was obvious at an early age , and he was harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven , who thought this would enable him to become a child prodigy like Mozart . He was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe . At age 21 , he moved to Vienna and studied composition with Joseph Haydn . Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist , and he was soon courted by Karl Alois , Prince Lichnowsky for compositions , which resulted in Opus 1 in 1795 . The piece was a great critical and commercial success and was followed by Symphony No . 1 in 1800 . This composition was distinguished by its frequent use of sforzandi , sudden shifts in tonal centers ( which were uncommon for traditional symphonic form ) , and the prominent , more independent use of wind instruments . In 1801 , he also gained fame for his six String Quartets and for the ballet The Creatures of Prometheus .

  "/wiki/La_fille_du_r\u00e9giment": "La fille du r\u00e9giment ( The Daughter of the Regiment ) is an op\u00e9ra comique in two acts by Gaetano Donizetti , set to a French libretto by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bayard . It was first performed on 11 February 1840 by the Paris Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the Salle de la Bourse . The opera was written by Donizetti while he was living in Paris between 1838 and 1840 preparing a revised version of his then-unperformed Italian opera , Poliuto , as Les martyrs for the Paris Op\u00e9ra . Since Martyrs was delayed , the composer had time to write the music for La fille du r\u00e9giment , his first opera set to a French text , as well as to stage the French version of Lucia di Lammermoor as Lucie de Lammermoor . La fille du r\u00e9giment quickly became a popular success partly because of the famous aria Ah ! mes amis , quel jour de f\u00eate ! , which requires the tenor to sing no fewer than eight high Cs - a frequently sung ninth is not written . La figlia del reggimento , a slightly different Italian-language version ( in translation by Calisto Bassi ) , was adapted to the tastes of the Italian public .",

Along with Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini , Donizetti was a leading composer of the bel canto opera style during the first half of the nineteenth century . Donizetti 's close association with the bel canto style was undoubtedly an influence on other composers such as Giuseppe Verdi . Donizetti was born in Bergamo in Lombardy . Although he did not come from a musical background , at an early age he was taken under the wing of composer Simon Mayr who had enrolled him by means of a full scholarship in a school which he had set up . There he received detailed training in the arts of fugue and counterpoint . Mayr was also instrumental in obtaining a place for the young man at the Bologna Academy , where , at the age of 19 , he wrote his first one-act opera , the comedy Il Pigmalione , which may never have been performed during his lifetime . Over the course of his career , Donizetti wrote almost 70 operas . An offer in 1822 from Domenico Barbaja , the impresario of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples , which followed the composer 's ninth opera , led to his move to that city and his residency there which lasted until the production of Caterina Cornaro in January 1844 . In all , Naples presented 51 of Donizetti 's operas .",
