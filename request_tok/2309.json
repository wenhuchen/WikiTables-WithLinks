  "/wiki/Holocaust": "The Holocaust , also known as the Shoah , [ b ] was the World War II genocide of the European Jews . Between 1941 and 1945 , across German-occupied Europe , Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews , around two-thirds of Europe 's Jewish population . [ a ] [ c ] The murders were carried out in pogroms and mass shootings ; by a policy of extermination through work in concentration camps ; and in gas chambers and gas vans in German extermination camps , chiefly Auschwitz , Be\u0142\u017cec , Che\u0142mno , Majdanek , Sobib\u00f3r , and Treblinka in occupied Poland . Germany implemented the persecution in stages . Following Adolf Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 , the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed undesirable , starting with Dachau on 22 March 1933 . After the passing of the Enabling Act on 24 March , which gave Hitler plenary powers , the government began isolating Jews from civil society ; this included boycotting Jewish businesses in April 1933 and enacting the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935 . On 9-10 November 1938 , eight months after Germany annexed Austria , Jewish businesses and other buildings were ransacked , smashed or set on fire throughout Germany and Austria during what became known as Kristallnacht ( the Night of Broken Glass ) . After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 , triggering World War II , the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews from the rest of the population . Eventually thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German-occupied Europe . The segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the Final Solution to the Jewish Question , discussed by senior Nazi officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January 1942 . As German forces captured territories in the East , all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized . Under the coordination of the SS , with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party , killings were committed within Germany itself , throughout occupied Europe , and within territories controlled by Germany 's allies .",
  "/wiki/Genocide": "Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people ( usually defined as an ethnic , national , racial , or religious group ) in whole or in part . The hybrid word genocide is a combination of the Greek word \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( race , people ) and the Latin suffix -caedo ( act of killing ) . The term genocide was coined by Raphael Lemkin in his 1944 book Axis Rule in Occupied Europe . The United Nations Genocide Convention , which was established in 1948 , defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group , as such including the killing of its members , causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group , deliberately imposing living conditions that seek to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part , preventing births , or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group . The term has been coined and applied to the Holocaust , the Armenian Genocide and many other mass killings including the genocide of indigenous peoples in the Americas , the Greek genocide , the Assyrian genocide , the Serbian genocide , the Holodomor , the Indonesian genocide , the Guatemalan genocide , the 1971 Bangladesh genocide , the Cambodian genocide , and after 1980 the Bosnian genocide , the Anfal genocide , the Darfur genocide , the Rwandan genocide and the Rohingya genocide . Others are listed in Genocides in history and List of genocides by death toll . The Political Instability Task Force estimated that , between 1956 and 2016 , a total of 43 genocides took place , causing the death of about 50 million people .

The evidence of occupation found in the rich series of sediments that accumulated over many thousands of years is regarded as internationally unique in demonstrating how prehistoric people managed to live at the extreme northernmost limits of their territory during the Late Pleistocene period . The caves contain occupation layers with evidence of flint tools from the Mousterian , proto-Solutrean , Creswellian and Maglemosian cultures . They were seasonally occupied by nomadic groups of people during the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods . Evidence of Neolithic , Bronze Age , Roman and post-medieval activity has also been found there . There is evidence of Neanderthal occupation 50,000-60,000 years ago , a brief Gravettian occupation around 32,000 years ago and use of all the main caves during the Magdalenian around 14,000 years ago . The site is open to the public and has a visitor centre with a small museum of objects associated with the caves , including a stuffed cave hyena .

  "/wiki/Flint": "Flint is a sedimentary cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz , categorized as the variety of chert that occurs in chalk or marly limestone . Flint was widely used historically to make stone tools and start fires . It occurs chiefly as nodules and masses in sedimentary rocks , such as chalks and limestones . Inside the nodule , flint is usually dark grey , black , green , white or brown in colour , and often has a glassy or waxy appearance . A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour , typically white and rough in texture . The nodules can often be found along streams and beaches . Flint breaks and chips into sharp-edged pieces , making it useful for knife blades and other cutting tools . The use of flint to make stone tools dates back millions of years , and flint 's extreme durability has made it possible to accurately date its use over this time . Flint is one of the primary materials used to define the Stone Age . During the Stone Age , access to flint was so important for survival that people would travel or trade to obtain flint . Flint Ridge in Ohio was an important source of flint and Native Americans extracted the flint from hundreds of quarries along the ridge . This Ohio Flint was traded across the eastern United States and has been found as far west as the Rocky Mountains and south around the Gulf of Mexico .",

  "/wiki/British_Civil_War": "The Wars of the Three Kingdoms , [ b ] sometimes known as the British Civil Wars , [ c ] [ d ] formed an intertwined series of conflicts that took place in the kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland between 1639 and 1651 . The English Civil War proper has become the best-known of these conflicts ; it included the abolition of the monarchy and the execution of the kingdoms ' monarch , Charles I , by the English Parliament in 1649 . The history of these wars is often extended to include the uprisings and conflicts that continued through the 1650s until the English Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , and sometimes to include Venner 's uprising the following year . The wars were the outcome of broadly set tensions over religious and civil issues . Religious disputes centred on whether religion was to be dictated by the monarch or by choice , the conscience of the individual , with many people feeling that they ought to have freedom of religion ( freedom of conscience ) . The related civil question was settling the extent to which the king 's rule was to be constrained by Parliament - in particular the right to raise taxes and armed forces without consent of the Parliament . The wars also had elements of national conflict , as Ireland and Scotland rebelled against England 's primacy within the Three Kingdoms . The broad and durable victory of the English Parliament - ultimately ( under Oliver Cromwell and the Army ) overcoming the king , the Irish and the Scots , and then outlasting the Cromwellian Protectorate itself - helped establish the future of Great Britain and Ireland as a constitutional monarchy with political power centred on the Parliament in London . These wars included the Bishops ' Wars of 1639 and 1640 ; the Irish Rebellion of 1641 ; Confederate Ireland , 1642-1649 ; the Scottish Civil War of 1644-1645 ; and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649 ( collectively the Eleven Years War or Irish Confederate Wars ) ; and the First , Second and Third English Civil Wars of 1642-1646 , 1648-1649 and 1650-1651 ."
