  "/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland": "The 26 cantons of Switzerland ( German : Kanton , French : canton , Italian : cantone , Romansh : chantun ) are the member states of the Swiss Confederation . The nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy in the form of the first three confederate allies used to be referred to as the Waldst\u00e4tte . Two further major steps in the development of the Swiss cantonal system are referred to by the terms Acht Orte ( Eight Cantons ; between 1353 and 1481 ) and Dreizehn Orte ( Thirteen Cantons , during 1513-1798 ) ; they were important intermediate periods of the Ancient Swiss Confederacy . Each canton , formerly also Ort ( from before 1450 ) , or Stand ( estate , from c. 1550 ) , was a fully sovereign state with its own border controls , army , and currency from at least the Treaty of Westphalia ( 1648 ) until the establishment of the Swiss federal state in 1848 , with a brief period of centralised government during the Helvetic Republic ( 1798-1803 ) . The term Kanton was widely used since then . From 1833 , there were 25 cantons , increasing to 26 after the secession of the canton of Jura from Bern in 1979 . The areas of the cantons vary from 37 km2 ( canton of Basel-Stadt ) to 7,105 km2 ( canton of Grisons ) ; the populations vary from 16,003 ( canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden ) to 1,487,969 ( canton of Z\u00fcrich ) .",
  "/wiki/Population": "In biology a population is all the organisms of the same group or species , which live in a particular geographical area . The area of a sexual population is the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area , and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas . In sociology , population refers to a collection of humans and their entire race . Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of populations . Population , in a more simple term , is the number of people in a city or town , region , country or world ; population is usually determined by a process called census ( a process of collecting , analyzing , compiling and publishing data ) .",
