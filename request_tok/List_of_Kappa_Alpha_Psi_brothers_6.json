  "/wiki/Hansberry_v._Lee": "Hansberry v. Lee , 311 U.S. 32 ( 1940 ) , is a famous case now usually known in civil procedure for teaching that res judicata may not bind a subsequent plaintiff who had no opportunity to be represented in the earlier civil action . The facts of the case dealt with a racially restrictive covenant that barred African Americans from purchasing or leasing land in the Washington Park Subdivision of Chicago 's Woodlawn neighborhood . The covenant had been upheld in a prior class action lawsuit , which had included Lee , along with all the other neighborhood landowners , as members of the class . The defense in the present case argued that Carl Augustus Hansberry ( father of Lorraine Hansberry ) could not contest the covenant because it had already been deemed valid by the courts in the prior lawsuit . The plaintiff 's case was successfully argued by civil rights attorney Earl B. Dickerson . The US Supreme Court disagreed and held that since some of the neighborhood landowners ( 46% ) comprising the class of the prior lawsuit did not support the restrictive covenant , the previous decision that the covenant was valid could not apply to all members of that class . In other words , it was erroneous to allow the 54% of neighborhood landowners who had supported the restrictive covenant to represent the interests of the 46% who were against it . Therefore , the Supreme Court held that the restrictive covenant could be contested in court again , even though some of the parties involved may have been included in the prior class of neighborhood landowner . Later , the type of real property restriction , racially restrictive covenants , was held by Shelley v. Kraemer , 334 U.S. 1 ( 1948 ) , to be state action because the plaintiffs seeking to enforce such a covenant were invoking the machinery of the state .",

  "/wiki/US_Court_of_Appeals": "The United States courts of appeals or circuit courts are the intermediate appellate courts of the United States federal judiciary . The courts are divided into 13 circuits , and each hears appeals from the district courts within its borders , or in some instances from other designated federal courts and administrative agencies . Appeals from the circuit courts are taken to the Supreme Court of the United States . The United States courts of appeals are considered among the most powerful and influential courts in the United States . Because of their ability to set legal precedent in regions that cover millions of Americans , the United States courts of appeals have strong policy influence on U.S. law . Moreover , because the Supreme Court chooses to review fewer than 2% of the more than 7,000 to 8,000 cases filed with it annually , the U.S. courts of appeals serve as the final arbiter on most federal cases . The D.C . Circuit in particular is very influential , since it covers Washington , D.C. , and thus covers Congress and many U.S. government agencies . The Ninth Circuit , which covers the entire west coast of the United States and contains 20% of the American population , is also an influential court . [ citation needed ] There are currently 179 judgeships on the U.S. courts of appeals authorized by Congress in 28 U.S.C . \u00a7 43 pursuant to Article III of the U.S. Constitution .
