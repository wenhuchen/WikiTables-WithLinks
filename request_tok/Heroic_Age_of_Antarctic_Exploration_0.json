  "/wiki/Belgium": "Belgium , [ A ] officially the Kingdom of Belgium , is a country in Western Europe . It is bordered by the Netherlands to the north , Germany to the east , Luxembourg to the southeast , France to the southwest , and the North Sea to the northwest . It covers an area of 30,689 km2 ( 11,849 sq mi ) and has a population of more than 11.5 million , making it the 22nd most densely populated country in the world and the 6th most densely populated country in Europe , with a density of 376 per square kilometre ( 970/sq mi ) . The capital and largest city is Brussels ; other major cities are Antwerp , Ghent , Charleroi and Li\u00e8ge . The sovereign state is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system . Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds . It is divided into three highly autonomous regions : the Flemish Region in the north , Wallonia in the south , and the Brussels-Capital Region . Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region , as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita . Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or communities : the Dutch-speaking Flemish Community , which constitutes about 60 percent of the population , and the French-speaking Community , which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians . A small German-speaking Community , numbering around one percent , exists in the East Cantons . The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual ( French and Dutch ) , although French is the dominant language . Belgium 's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance , made up of six different governments .",

  "/wiki/Overwinter": "Overwintering is the process by which some organisms pass through or wait out the winter season , or pass through that period of the year when winter conditions ( cold or sub-zero temperatures , ice , snow , limited food supplies ) make normal activity or even survival difficult or near impossible . In some cases winter is characterized not necessarily by cold but by dry conditions ; passing through such periods could likewise be called overwintering . Hibernation and migration are the two major ways in which overwintering is accomplished . Overwintering occurs in several classes of lifeform :",

The region south of this circle is known as the Antarctic , and the zone immediately to the north is called the Southern Temperate Zone . South of the Antarctic Circle , the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year ( and therefore visible at midnight ) and the centre of the sun ( ignoring refraction ) is below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year ( and therefore not visible at noon ) ; this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Northern Hemisphere , the Arctic Circle . The position of the Antarctic Circle is not fixed and currently runs 66\u00b033\u203248.0\u2033 south of the Equator . ( Actually , this figure is slightly incorrect because it does n't allow for the effects of Nutation , which can be up to 10 . ) Its latitude depends on the Earth 's axial tilt , which fluctuates within a margin of more than 2\u00b0 over a 41,000-year period , due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon . Consequently , the Antarctic Circle is currently drifting southwards at a speed of about 15 m ( 49 ft ) per year .",

  "/wiki/Southern_Cross_Expedition": "The Southern Cross Expedition , otherwise known as the British Antarctic Expedition , 1898-1900 , was the first British venture of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration , and the forerunner of the more celebrated journeys of Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton . The brainchild of the Anglo-Norwegian explorer Carsten Borchgrevink , it was the first expedition to over-winter on the Antarctic mainland , the first to visit the Great Ice Barrier - later known as the Ross Ice Shelf - since Sir James Clark Ross 's groundbreaking expedition of 1839 to 1843 , and the first to effect a landing on the Barrier 's surface . It also pioneered the use of dogs and sledges in Antarctic travel . The expedition was privately financed by the British magazine publisher Sir George Newnes . Borchgrevink 's party sailed in the Southern Cross , and spent the southern winter of 1899 at Cape Adare , the northwest extremity of the Ross Sea coastline . Here they carried out an extensive programme of scientific observations , although opportunities for inland exploration were restricted by the mountainous and glaciated terrain surrounding the base . In January 1900 , the party left Cape Adare in Southern Cross to explore the Ross Sea , following the route taken by Ross 60 years earlier . They reached the Great Ice Barrier , where a team of three made the first sledge journey on the Barrier surface , during which a new Farthest South record latitude was established at 78\u00b0 50\u2032S . On its return to England the expedition was coolly received by London 's geographical establishment exemplified by the Royal Geographical Society , which resented the pre-emption of the pioneering Antarctic role they envisaged for the Discovery Expedition . There were also questions about Borchgrevink 's leadership qualities , and criticism of the limited extent of scientific results . Thus , despite the number of significant firsts , Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton , and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers . However , Roald Amundsen , conqueror of the South Pole in 1911 , acknowledged that Borchgrevink 's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel , and had opened the way for all the expeditions that followed .",

  "/wiki/Carsten_Borchgrevink": "Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink ( 1 December 1864 - 21 April 1934 ) was an Anglo-Norwegian polar explorer and a pioneer of modern Antarctic travel . He was the precursor of Sir Robert Falcon Scott , Sir Ernest Shackleton , Roald Amundsen , and others associated with the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration . From 1898 to 1900 , he led the British-financed Southern Cross expedition , which established a new Farthest South record at 78\u00b0 50 'S . Borchgrevink began his exploring career in 1894 , by joining a Norwegian whaling expedition , during which he became one of the first persons to set foot on the Antarctic mainland . This achievement helped him to obtain backing for his Southern Cross expedition , which became the first to overwinter on the Antarctic mainland , and the first to visit the Great Ice Barrier since the expedition of Sir James Clark Ross nearly 60 years previously . However , the expedition 's successes , including the Farthest South , were received with only moderate interest by the public and by the British geographical establishment , whose attention was by then focused on Scott 's upcoming Discovery expedition . Some of Borchgrevink 's colleagues were critical of his leadership , and his own accounts of the expedition were regarded as journalistic and unreliable . After the Southern Cross expedition , Borchgrevink was one of three scientists sent to the Caribbean in 1902 , by the National Geographic Society , to report on the aftermath of the Mount Pel\u00e9e eruption . Thereafter he settled in Kristiania , leading a life mainly away from public attention . His pioneering work was subsequently recognised and honoured by several countries , and in 1912 , he received a handsome tribute from Roald Amundsen , conqueror of the South Pole . In 1930 , the Royal Geographical Society finally acknowledged Borchgrevink 's contribution to polar exploration and awarded him its Patron 's Medal . The Society acknowledged in its citation that justice had not previously been done to the work of the Southern Cross expedition .",

  "/wiki/Farthest_South": "Farthest South refers the most southerly latitude reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911 . Significant steps on the road to the pole were the discovery of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619 , Captain James Cook 's crossing of the Antarctic Circle in 1773 , and the earliest confirmed sightings of the Antarctic mainland in 1820 . From the late 19th century onward , the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole , which culminated in Roald Amundsen 's success in December 1911 . In the years before reaching the pole was a realistic objective , other motives drew adventurers southward . Initially , the driving force was the discovery of new trade routes between Europe and the Far East . After such routes had been established and the main geographical features of the earth had been broadly mapped , the lure for mercantile adventurers was the great fertile continent of Terra Australis which , according to myth , lay hidden in the south . Belief in the existence of this supposed land of plenty persisted well into the 18th century ; explorers were reluctant to accept the truth that slowly emerged , of a cold , harsh environment in the lands of the Southern Ocean . James Cook 's voyages of 1771-74 demonstrated conclusively the likely hostile nature of any hidden lands . This caused a shift of emphasis in the first half of the 19th century , away from trade and towards sealing and whaling , and then exploration and discovery . After the first overwintering on continental Antarctica in 1898-99 ( Adrien de Gerlache ) , the prospect of reaching the South Pole appeared realistic , and the race for the pole began . The British were pre-eminent in this endeavour , which was characterised by the rivalry between Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration . Shackleton 's efforts fell short ; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen .",
  "/wiki/South_Magnetic_Pole": "The South Magnetic Pole is the wandering point on Earth 's Southern Hemisphere where the geomagnetic field lines are directed vertically upwards . It should not be confused with the South Geomagnetic Pole described later .

After service as a merchant ship before and during the First World War , Discovery was taken into the service of the British government in 1923 to carry out scientific research in the Southern Ocean , becoming the first Royal Research Ship . The ship undertook a two-year expedition - the Discovery Investigations - recording valuable information on the oceans , marine life and being the first scientific investigation into whale populations . From 1929 to 1931 Discovery served as the base for the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition ( BANZARE ) under Douglas Mawson , a major scientific and territorial quest in what is now the Australian Antarctic Territory . On her return from the BANZARE , Discovery was moored in London as a static training ship and visitor attraction until 1979 when she was placed in the care of the Maritime Trust as a museum ship . After an extensive restoration Discovery is now the centrepiece of a visitor attraction in the city where she was built , Dundee .

On the first expedition , he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82\u00b0S and discovered the Antarctic Plateau , on which the South Pole is located . On the second venture , Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912 , less than five weeks after Amundsen 's South Pole expedition . A planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed , despite Scott 's written instructions , and at a distance of 162 miles ( 261 km ) from their base camp at Hut Point and approximately 12.5 miles ( 20 km ) from the next depot , Scott and his companions died . When Scott and his party 's bodies were discovered , they had in their possession the first Antarctic fossils ever discovered . The fossils were determined to be from the Glossopteris tree and proved that Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents . Before his appointment to lead the Discovery expedition , Scott had followed the career of a naval officer in the Royal Navy . In 1899 , he had a chance encounter with Sir Clements Markham , the president of the Royal Geographical Society , and thus learned of a planned Antarctic expedition , which he soon volunteered to lead . Having taken this step , his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic , the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life . Following the news of his death , Scott became a celebrated hero , a status reflected by memorials erected across the UK . However , in the last decades of the 20th century , questions were raised about his competence and character . Commentators in the 21st century have regarded Scott more positively after assessing the temperature drop below \u221240 \u00b0C ( \u221240 \u00b0F ) in March 1912 , and after re-discovering Scott 's written orders of October 1911 , in which he had instructed the dog teams to meet and assist him on the return trip .",

It has a low population density of 22 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 57/sq mi ) and the highest urban concentration is in the central and southern half of the country . Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia . The climate is in general mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence . In spite of the high latitude , Sweden often has warm continental summers , being located in between the North Atlantic , the Baltic Sea and the vast Eurasian Russian landmass . The general climate and environment varies significantly from the south and north due to the vast latitudal difference and much of Sweden has reliably cold and snowy winters . Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural , while the north is heavily forested and includes a portion of the Scandinavian Mountains .",

It is claimed by Argentina ( as part of Argentine Antarctica ) , Britain ( as part of the British Antarctic Territory ) and Chile ( as part of the Chilean Antarctic Territory ) . Graham Land is the closest part of Antarctica to South America . Thus it is the usual destination for small ships taking paying visitors on Antarctic trips from South America . ( Larger ships are not allowed to disembark passengers . ) Until the discoveries of the British Graham Land Expedition of 1934-1937 , it was generally supposed to be an archipelago rather than a peninsula .

To the east of Cape Norvegia is the King Haakon VII Sea . Much of the southern part of the sea is covered by a permanent , massive ice shelf field , the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf . The sea is contained within the two overlapping Antarctic territorial claims of Argentine Antarctica , the British Antarctic Territory , and also resides partially within the Antarctic Chilean Territory . At its widest the sea is around 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) across , and its area is around 2.8 million square kilometres ( 1.1\u00d710^6 sq mi ) .

  "/wiki/Scottish_National_Antarctic_Expedition": "The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition ( SNAE ) , 1902-04 , was organised and led by William Speirs Bruce , a natural scientist and former medical student from the University of Edinburgh . Although overshadowed in prestige terms by Robert Falcon Scott 's concurrent Discovery Expedition , the SNAE completed a full programme of exploration and scientific work . Its achievements included the establishment of a manned meteorological station , the first in Antarctic territory , and the discovery of new land to the east of the Weddell Sea . Its large collection of biological and geological specimens , together with those from Bruce 's earlier travels , led to the establishment of the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in 1906 . Bruce had spent most of the 1890s engaged on expeditions to the Antarctic and Arctic regions , and by 1899 was Britain 's most experienced polar scientist . In March of that year , he applied to join the Discovery Expedition ; however , his proposal to extend that expedition 's field of work into the Weddell Sea quadrant , using a second ship , was dismissed as mischievous rivalry by Royal Geographical Society ( RGS ) president Sir Clements Markham . Bruce reacted by obtaining independent finance ; his venture was supported and promoted by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society . The expedition has been described as by far the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientific expedition of the Heroic Age . Despite this , Bruce received no formal honour or recognition from the British Government , and the expedition 's members were denied the prestigious Polar Medal despite vigorous lobbying . After the SNAE , Bruce led no more Antarctic expeditions , although he made regular Arctic trips . His focus on serious scientific exploration was out of fashion with his times , and his achievements , unlike those of the polar adventurers Scott , Shackleton and Amundsen , soon faded from public awareness . The SNAE 's permanent memorial is the Orcadas weather station , which was set up in 1903 as Omond House on Laurie Island , South Orkneys , and has been in continuous operation ever since .",

Among other achievements , the expedition established the first permanent weather station in Antarctica . Bruce later founded the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in Edinburgh , but his plans for a transcontinental Antarctic march via the South Pole were abandoned because of lack of public and financial support . In 1892 Bruce gave up his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh and joined the Dundee Whaling Expedition to Antarctica as a scientific assistant . This was followed by Arctic voyages to Novaya Zemlya , Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land . In 1899 Bruce , by then Britain 's most experienced polar scientist , applied for a post on Robert Falcon Scott 's Discovery Expedition , but delays over this appointment and clashes with Royal Geographical Society ( RGS ) president Sir Clements Markham led him instead to organise his own expedition , and earned him the permanent enmity of the British geographical establishment . Although Bruce received various awards for his polar work , including an honorary doctorate from the University of Aberdeen , neither he nor any of his SNAE colleagues were recommended by the RGS for the prestigious Polar Medal . Between 1907 and 1920 Bruce made many journeys to the Arctic regions , both for scientific and for commercial purposes . His failure to mount any major exploration ventures after the SNAE is usually attributed to his lack of public relations skills , powerful enemies , and his fervent Scottish nationalism . By 1919 his health was failing , and he experienced several spells in hospital before his death in 1921 , after which he was almost totally forgotten . In recent years , following the centenary of the Scottish Expedition , efforts have been made to give fuller recognition to his role in the history of scientific polar exploration .",

  "/wiki/Nimrod_Expedition": "The Nimrod Expedition of 1907-09 , otherwise known as the British Antarctic Expedition , was the first of three expeditions to the Antarctic led by Ernest Shackleton . Its main target , among a range of geographical and scientific objectives , was to be first to the South Pole . This was not attained , but the expedition 's southern march reached a Farthest South latitude of 88\u00b0 23 ' S , just 97.5 nautical miles ( 180.6 km ; 112.2 mi ) from the pole . This was by far the longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either Pole . [ a ] A separate group led by Welsh Australian geology professor Edgeworth David reached the estimated location of the South Magnetic Pole , and the expedition also achieved the first ascent of Mount Erebus , Antarctica 's second highest volcano . The expedition lacked governmental or institutional support , and relied on private loans and individual contributions . It was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried . Its ship , Nimrod , was less than half of the size of Robert Falcon Scott 's 1901-04 expedition ship Discovery , and Shackleton 's crew lacked relevant experience . Controversy arose from Shackleton 's decision to base the expedition in McMurdo Sound , close to Scott 's old headquarters , in contravention of a promise to Scott that he would not do so . Nevertheless , although the expedition 's profile was initially much lower than that of Scott 's six years earlier , its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made Shackleton a public hero . The scientific team , which included the future Australasian Antarctic Expedition leader Douglas Mawson , carried out extensive geological , zoological and meteorological work . Shackleton 's transport arrangements , based on Manchurian ponies , motor traction , and sled dogs , were innovations which , despite limited success , were later copied by Scott for his ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition .",
  "/wiki/Nimrod_(ship)": "Nimrod was the ship Ernest Shackleton used in his 1908 Antarctic Nimrod Expedition for the South Pole . It was a 41-year-old schooner of 334 gross register tons that had been used to hunt seals and whales . Shackleton , who paid \u00a35,000 for the ship , had it re-rigged as a barquentine . It also had an auxiliary steam engine , but had a top speed of only six knots under this power . In addition , the ship was so overloaded with supplies for the expedition that it could not carry enough coal to make passage to the Antarctic from New Zealand , and Shackleton had to arrange for the ship to be towed to the edge of the pack ice by tramp steamer Koonya . The New Zealand government paid half the cost of the tow ; Sir James Mills , Chairman of the Union Steamship Company , paid the other half . The Koonya was captained by Fredrick Pryce Evans during the tow . Nimrod was initially captained by Rupert England , but Shackleton was dissatisfied with him and replaced him with Frederick Pryce Evans , who commanded the ship on the relief voyage in 1909 . Nimrod was sold on Shackleton 's return to Great Britain . Nimrod 's fate , 10 years after its return from the Antarctic , was to be battered to pieces in the North Sea , after running aground on the Barber Sands off the Norfolk coast on 31 January 1919 . Only two of her 12-person crew survived . A number of geographic features of Antarctica were named after the ship , including Nimrod Glacier .",

He was one of the principal figures of the period known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration . Shackleton 's first experience of the polar regions was as third officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott 's Discovery expedition of 1901-1904 , from which he was sent home early on health grounds , after he and his companions Scott and Edward Adrian Wilson set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82\u00b0S . During the Nimrod expedition of 1907-1909 , he and three companions established a new record Farthest South latitude at 88\u00b0S , only 97 geographical miles ( 112 statute miles or 180 kilometres ) from the South Pole , the largest advance to the pole in exploration history . Also , members of his team climbed Mount Erebus , the most active Antarctic volcano . For these achievements , Shackleton was knighted by King Edward VII on his return home . After the race to the South Pole ended in December 1911 , with Roald Amundsen 's conquest , Shackleton turned his attention to the crossing of Antarctica from sea to sea , via the pole . To this end , he made preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition , 1914-1917 . Disaster struck this expedition when its ship , Endurance , became trapped in pack ice and was slowly crushed before the shore parties could be landed . The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated , then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and ultimately South Georgia Island , a stormy ocean voyage of 720 nautical miles ( 1,330 km ; 830 mi ) and Shackleton 's most famous exploit .

The glacier is one of the main passages through the Transantarctic Mountains to the great polar plateau beyond , and was one of the early routes to the South Pole despite its steep upward incline . The glacier was discovered and climbed by Ernest Shackleton during his Nimrod Expedition of 1908 . Although Shackleton turned back before reaching the South Pole , he established the first proven route towards the pole and , in doing so , became the first person to set foot upon the polar plateau . In 1911-1912 , Captain Scott and his Terra Nova Expedition team reached the South Pole by similarly climbing the Beardmore . However , they reached the pole a month after Roald Amundsen and his team , who had chosen a route up the previously unknown Axel Heiberg Glacier . It was on the way back to the Nova expedition 's base camp after they left the South Pole that Edgar Evans , one of the members of Scott 's chosen team to go to on the final trek to the South Pole , died around the foot of Beardmore Glacier on February 17 , 1912 .

After failing to land in its first season , the Japanese expedition 's original aim of reaching the South Pole was replaced by less ambitious objectives , and after a more successful second season it returned safely to Japan , without injury or loss of life . The brainchild of an army reserve lieutenant , Nobu Shirase , the expedition was privately funded . It left Japan in November 1910 , and after its first season 's failure was forced to spend the winter of 1911 in Australia . In its second Antarctic season , 1911-12 , it made no major scientific or geographical discoveries , but could claim some significant achievements . These included the first landing on the coast of King Edward VII Land , the fastest recorded sledging journey , and the most easterly point along the Antarctic coast , to that date , reached by a ship .

He led the first Japanese Antarctic Expedition , 1910-12 , which reached a southern latitude of 80\u00b05\u2032 , and made the first landing on the coast of King Edward VII Land . Shirase had harboured polar ambitions since boyhood . By way of preparation , during his military service he participated in an expedition to the northern Kuril Islands . This venture was poorly organised and ended badly , but nonetheless provided him with useful training for future polar exploration . His longstanding intention was to lead an expedition to the North Pole , but when this mark was claimed by Robert Peary in 1909 , Shirase switched his attention to the south . Unable to attract government support for his Antarctic venture , Shirase raised the finance privately . In its first season , 1910-11 , the expedition failed to make a landing , and was forced to winter in Australia . Its second attempt , in 1911-12 , was more successful . Although the expedition 's achievements were modest , it demonstrated that the Japanese were competent Antarctic travellers , and Shirase returned to Japan in June 1912 to much local acclaim , although the rest of the world showed little interest in his exploits . Even in Japan his fame was short-lived , and Shirase soon found himself faced with a burden of expedition debt that took him most of the rest of his life to redeem . He died in relative poverty in 1946 .",
  "/wiki/King_Edward_VII_Land": "King Edward VII Land or King Edward VII Peninsula is a large , ice-covered peninsula which forms the northwestern extremity of Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica . The peninsula projects into the Ross Sea between Sulzberger Bay and the northeast corner of the Ross Ice Shelf , and forms part of the Ross Dependency . Edward VII Peninsula is defined by the Ross Ice Shelf on the southwest , Okuma Bay on the west , and to the east by Sulzberger Bay and the Saunders Coast , all essentially on the Ross Sea / Southern Ocean in Antarctica . The northwest extremity of the peninsula is Cape Colbeck . Edward VII Peninsula is located at 77\u00b040\u2032S 155\u00b000\u2032W / 77.667\u00b0S 155.000\u00b0W / -77.667 ; -155.000 . The western coast is Shirase Coast . In the north and east the Swinburne Ice Shelf is located . Edward VII Peninsula was discovered on 30 January 1902 by the British National Antarctic Expedition ( BrNAE ) ( 1901-1904 ) under Robert Falcon Scott , who named it King Edward VII Land for King Edward VII of the United Kingdom . The coastline was further explored by the Nimrod Expedition under Ernest Shackleton in 1908-09 , and the first landfall was made by a party of the Japanese Antarctic Expedition led by Shirase Nobu in 1912 . The region was renamed Edward VII Peninsula after the peninsular character of the region was determined by exploration conducted by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition ( 1933-1935 ) and the United States Antarctic Service ( USAS ) Expedition ( 1939-1941 ) . Most of the peninsula is within the Ross Dependency , claimed by New Zealand ( see Territorial claims of Antarctica ) .",

The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden ( 1,619 km or 1,006 mi long ) . Norway is bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east , and the Skagerrak strait to the south , with Denmark on the other side . Norway has an extensive coastline , facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea . The maritime influence also dominates Norway 's climate with mild lowland temperatures on the sea coasts , whereas the interior , while colder , is also a lot milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes .

  "/wiki/Amundsen's_South_Pole_expedition": "The first expedition to reach the geographic South Pole was led by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen . He and four others arrived at the pole on 14 December 1911 , [ n 1 ] five weeks ahead of a British party led by Robert Falcon Scott as part of the Terra Nova Expedition . Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base , and later heard that Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey . Amundsen 's initial plans had focused on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole by means of an extended drift in an icebound ship . He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen 's polar exploration ship Fram , and undertook extensive fundraising . Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when , in 1909 , the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole . Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole ; uncertain of the extent to which the public and his backers would support him , he kept this revised objective secret . When he set out in June 1910 , he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift , and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call , Madeira . Amundsen made his Antarctic base , which he named Framheim , in the Bay of Whales on the Great Ice Barrier . After months of preparation , depot-laying and a false start that ended in near-disaster , he and his party set out for the pole in October 1911 . In the course of their journey they discovered the Axel Heiberg Glacier , which provided their route to the polar plateau and ultimately to the South Pole . The party 's mastery of the use of skis and their expertise with sled dogs ensured rapid and relatively trouble-free travel .",

This huge glacier was discovered in November 1911 by the Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen , and named by him for Axel Heiberg , a Norwegian businessman and patron of science who contributed to numerous Norwegian polar expeditions . Amundsen used this glacier as his route up onto the polar plateau during his successful expedition to the South Pole . Unlike the big outlet glaciers such as the Beardmore , Shackleton and Liv , the Axel Heiberg is in effect an alpine glacier , cut off from the Plateau by a dolerite rim and fed entirely from the uncharacteristically heavy snow falling within its own catchment .

Scott wished to continue the scientific work that he had begun when leading the Discovery expedition to the Antarctic from 1901 to 1904 . He also wanted to be the first to reach the geographic South Pole . He and four companions attained the pole on 17 January 1912 , where they found that the Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had preceded them by 34 days . Scott 's entire party died on the return journey from the pole ; some of their bodies , journals , and photographs were found by a search party eight months later . The expedition , named after its supply ship , was a private venture , financed by public contributions augmented by a government grant . It had further backing from the Admiralty , which released experienced seamen to the expedition , and from the Royal Geographical Society . The expedition 's team of scientists carried out a comprehensive scientific programme , while other parties explored Victoria Land and the Western Mountains . An attempted landing and exploration of King Edward VII Land was unsuccessful . A journey to Cape Crozier in June-July 1911 was the first extended sledging journey in the depths of the Antarctic winter .

  "/wiki/Second_German_Antarctic_Expedition": "The Second German Antarctic Expedition of 1911-1913 was led by Wilhelm Filchner in the exploration ship Deutschland . Its principal objective was to determine whether the Antarctic continent comprised a single landmass rather than separated elements , and in particular whether the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea were connected by a strait . In addition , an extensive programme of scientific research was undertaken . The expedition failed to establish a land base , and the ship became beset in the Weddell Sea ice , drifting north for eight months before reaching open water . The expedition was marred by considerable disagreement and animosity among its participants , and broke up in disarray . The expedition secured the patronage of Luitpold , Prince Regent of Bavaria , who formed a fundraising committee which organised , among other activities , a public lottery . After leaving Germany early in May 1911 , the expedition carried out a thorough oceanographic survey of the Atlantic Ocean before arriving in South Georgia in October . Subsequently , despite being hampered by heavy sea ice , Deutschland penetrated the Weddell Sea beyond the southernmost point reached by James Weddell in 1823 . It discovered new land which it named Prinzregent Luitpold Land ( otherwise Luitpold Coast ) , and reached the southern limit of the Weddell Sea at the Filchner Ice Shelf . Attempts to set up their land base at a small inlet which they named Vahsel Bay failed when they chose a site on insecure ice which broke away , taking the camp with it . Although much equipment was salvaged , further attempts to establish a land base also failed . By then , Deutschland was unable to escape from the ice , and began its long drift northwards .",

During this expedition she was taken further south in the Weddell Sea than any previous vessel in those waters , but became trapped , surviving an eight-months long drift in heavy ice before being freed . After the expedition she was sold to Austria as the basis for another planned Antarctic expedition , but this was cancelled on the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 .

He conducted several surveys and scientific investigations in China , Tibet and surrounding regions , and led the Second German Antarctic Expedition , 1911-13 . As a young military officer , Filchner gained an early reputation for dash and daring , following his travel exploits in Russia and the Pamir Mountains range . After further technical studies , he developed expertise in geography and geophysics , before leading a major scientific survey in Tibet and western China in 1903-05 . In 1909 he was appointed to organise and lead the forthcoming German expedition to the Antarctic , with both scientific and geographical objectives involving extensive exploration of the continent 's interior . During the expedition his ship became trapped in the Weddell Sea ice , drifting for eight months and preventing Filchner from establishing a land base , thus failing in its main objective . Although important scientific results were obtained , the expedition was disrupted by serious interpersonal disagreements and lasting animosities , which harmed Filchner 's reputation as a leader and ended his polar career . After service in the First World War he resumed his travels in Asia . He conducted two lengthy single-handed magnetic surveys in China and Tibet , often in difficult and sometimes dangerous conditions , and was continuing this work when the Second World War began , leaving him stranded in India . After years of internment , he returned to Europe and retired to Z\u00fcrich , where he died in 1957 .

Its boundaries and area have been defined by the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research as having an area of 637,000 square kilometres ( 246,000 sq mi ) . The circulation of the Ross Sea is dominated by a wind-driven ocean gyre and the flow is strongly influenced by three submarine ridges that run from southwest to northeast [ citation needed ] . The circumpolar deep water current is a relatively warm , salty and nutrient-rich water mass that flows onto the continental shelf at certain locations . The Ross Sea is covered with ice for most of the year [ citation needed ] . The nutrient-laden water supports an abundance of plankton and this encourages a rich marine fauna . At least ten mammal species , six bird species and 95 fish species are found here , as well as many invertebrates , and the sea remains relatively unaffected by human activities . New Zealand has claimed that the sea comes under its jurisdiction as part of the Ross Dependency .

The expedition was organised into three bases : one on the sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island and two on the Antarctic mainland . The main base , under Mawson 's command , was set up at Cape Denison , about 300 miles ( 480 km ) west of Cape Adare , and a Western base under Frank Wild was established on the Shackleton Ice Shelf , more than 1,500 miles ( 2,410 km ) west of Cape Denison . Activities at both mainland bases were hampered by extreme winds , which often made outside work impossible . Nevertheless , in the course of the expedition , sledging parties covered around 2,600 miles ( 4,180 km ) of unexplored territory while the expedition 's ship , SY Aurora , navigated 1,800 miles ( 2,900 km ) of unmapped coastline . Scientific activities included meteorological measurements , magnetic observations , an expansive oceanographic program , and the collection of many biological and geological samples , including the discovery of the first meteorite found in Antarctica . The expedition was the first to establish and maintain wireless contact between Antarctica and Australia . Another planned innovation - the use of an aircraft - was thwarted by an accident before the expedition sailed . The plane 's fuselage was adapted to form a motorised sledge or air-tractor , but it proved to be of very limited use . The expedition was marred by the deaths of two members during an attempt to reach Oates Land : Belgrave Edward Ninnis , who fell into a crevasse , and Xavier Mertz , who died on the harrowing return journey . Mawson , their sledging partner , was then forced to make an arduous solo trek back to base ; he missed the ship , and had to spend an extra year at Cape Denison , along with a relief party of six .

Conceived by Sir Ernest Shackleton , the expedition was an attempt to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent . After Amundsen 's South Pole expedition in 1911 , this crossing remained , in Shackleton 's words , the one great main object of Antarctic journeyings . The expedition failed to accomplish this objective , but became recognized instead as an epic feat of endurance . Shackleton had served in the Antarctic on the Discovery expedition of 1901-1904 , and had led the Nimrod expedition of 1907-1909 . In this new venture he proposed to sail to the Weddell Sea and to land a shore party near Vahsel Bay , in preparation for a transcontinental march via the South Pole to the Ross Sea . A supporting group , the Ross Sea party , would meanwhile establish camp in McMurdo Sound , and from there lay a series of supply depots across the Ross Ice Shelf to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier . These depots would be essential for the transcontinental party 's survival , as the group would not be able to carry enough provisions for the entire crossing . The expedition required two ships : Endurance under Shackleton for the Weddell Sea party , and Aurora , under Aeneas Mackintosh , for the Ross Sea party . Endurance became beset in the ice of the Weddell Sea before reaching Vahsel Bay , and drifted northward , held in the pack ice , throughout the Antarctic winter of 1915 . Eventually the ship was crushed and sunk , stranding its 28-man complement on the ice .

  "/wiki/Drift_ice": "Drift ice , also called brash ice , is sea ice that is not attached to the shoreline or any other fixed object ( shoals , grounded icebergs , etc. ) . Unlike fast ice , which is fastened to a fixed object , drift ice is carried along by winds and sea currents , hence its name . When drift ice is driven together into a large single mass ( > 70% coverage ) , it is called pack ice . Wind and currents can pile up that ice to form ridges up to several metres in height . These represent a challenge for icebreakers and offshore structures operating in cold oceans and seas . Drift ice consists of ice floes , individual pieces of sea ice 20 metres ( 66 ft ) or more across . Floes are classified according to size : small - 20 metres ( 66 ft ) to 100 metres ( 330 ft ) ; medium - 100 metres ( 330 ft ) to 500 metres ( 1,600 ft ) ; big - 500 metres ( 1,600 ft ) to 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) ; vast - 2 kilometres ( 1.2 mi ) to 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) ; and giant - more than 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) .

  "/wiki/Voyage_of_the_James_Caird": "The voyage of the James Caird was a journey of 1,300 kilometres ( 800 mi ) from Elephant Island in the South Shetland Islands through the Southern Ocean to South Georgia , undertaken by Sir Ernest Shackleton and five companions to obtain rescue for the main body of the stranded Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-1917 . Polar historians regard the voyage of the exhausted crew in a 22.5 ' lifeboat through the Furious Fifties , known for their 60 ' waves and hurricane-force winds , as one of the greatest small-boat journeys ever completed . In October 1915 , pack ice in the Weddell Sea had crushed and sunk the main expedition ship Endurance , leaving Shackleton and his 27 companions adrift on a precarious ice surface . They drifted northward until April 1916 , when the floe on which they had encamped broke up , when they made their way in the ship 's lifeboats to Elephant Island . Shackleton then decided to sail one of the lifeboats to South Georgia , not the closest human settlement , but the only one not requiring sailing into the teeth of the prevailing westerlies in an open boat . Of the three lifeboats , the James Caird was deemed the strongest and most likely to survive the journey . Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird , a Dundee philanthropist whose sponsorship had helped finance the expedition . Before its voyage , the ship 's carpenter , Harry McNish , strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the mighty seas of the Southern Ocean , sealing his makeshift wood and canvas deck with lamp wick , oil paint and seal blood . Surviving a series of dangers , including a near capsizing , the boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a voyage that lasted 16 days . Shackleton and two companions then had to cross the island 's mountainous interior to reach a whaling station on the northern side . Here he organised the relief of the three men left on the south side of the island , of the Elephant Island party , and the return of his men home without loss of life , then the rescue of the Ross Sea party of his expedition . After the First World War , in 1919 , the James Caird was moved from South Georgia to England .",
  "/wiki/Ross_Sea_party": "The Ross Sea party was a component of Sir Ernest Shackleton 's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition 1914-17 . Its task was to lay a series of supply depots across the Great Ice Barrier from the Ross Sea to the Beardmore Glacier , along the polar route established by earlier Antarctic expeditions . The expedition 's main party , under Shackleton , was to land near Vahsel Bay on the opposite coast of Antarctica , and to march across the continent via the South Pole to the Ross Sea . As the main party would be unable to carry sufficient fuel and supplies for the whole distance , their survival depended on the Ross Sea party setting up supply depots , which would cover the final quarter of their journey . Shackleton set sail from London on his ship Endurance , bound for the Weddell Sea in August 1914 . Meanwhile , the Ross Sea party personnel gathered in Australia , prior to departure for the Ross Sea in the second expedition ship , SY Aurora . Organisational and financial problems delayed their start until December 1914 , which shortened their first depot-laying season . After their arrival the inexperienced party struggled to master the art of Antarctic travel , in the process losing most of their sled dogs . A greater misfortune occurred at the onset of the southern winter when the Aurora , locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf , was torn from its moorings . The ocean currents then took the ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore , and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice . Sadly , the Aurora 's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party . Despite these setbacks , the Ross Sea party survived inter-personnel disputes , extreme weather , illness , and the deaths of three of its members to carry out its mission in full during its second Antarctic season .",
  "/wiki/Aeneas_Mackintosh": "Aeneas Lionel Acton Mackintosh ( 1 July 1879 - 8 May 1916 ) was a British Merchant Navy officer and Antarctic explorer , who commanded the Ross Sea party as part of Sir Ernest Shackleton 's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition , 1914-1917 . The Ross Sea party 's mission was to support Shackleton 's proposed transcontinental march by laying supply depots along the latter stages of the march 's intended route . In the face of persistent setbacks and practical difficulties , Mackintosh 's party fulfilled its task , although he and two others died in the course of their duties . Mackintosh 's first Antarctic experience was as second officer on Shackleton 's Nimrod expedition , 1907-1909 . Shortly after his arrival in the Antarctic , a shipboard accident destroyed his right eye , and he was sent back to New Zealand . He returned in 1909 to participate in the later stages of the expedition ; his will and determination in adversity impressed Shackleton , and led to his Ross Sea party appointment in 1914 . Having brought his party to the Antarctic , Mackintosh was faced with numerous difficulties . Confused and vague orders meant he was uncertain of the timing of Shackleton 's proposed march . His problems were compounded when the party 's ship , SY Aurora , was swept from its winter moorings during a gale and was unable to return , causing the loss of vital equipment and supplies . In carrying out the party 's depot-laying task , one man died ; Mackintosh barely survived , owing his life to the actions of his comrades who brought him to safety . Restored to health , he and a companion disappeared while attempting to return to the expedition 's base camp by crossing the unstable sea ice . Mackintosh 's competence and leadership skills have been questioned by polar historians .",

  "/wiki/Shackleton\u2013Rowett_Expedition": "The Shackleton-Rowett Expedition ( 1921-22 ) was Sir Ernest Shackleton 's last Antarctic project , and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration . The venture , financed by John Quiller Rowett , is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest , a converted Norwegian sealer . Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea , but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support ; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic . Quest , smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel , soon proved inadequate for its task , and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems . Before the expedition 's work could properly begin , Shackleton died on board the ship , just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia . The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic , under the leadership of the party 's second-in-command , Frank Wild . The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence : slow speed , heavy fuel consumption , a tendency to roll in heavy seas , and a steady leak . The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20\u00b0E , well short of its easterly target , and its engine 's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice . Following several fruitless attempts , Wild returned the ship to South Georgia , on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance , during Shackleton 's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier . Wild had thoughts of a second , more productive season in the ice , and took the ship to Cape Town for a refit . Here , in June 1922 , he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England , so the expedition ended quietly . The Quest voyage is not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration , due to the event that defines it in public memory , overshadowing its other activities : Shackleton 's untimely death .",
  "/wiki/Quest_(ship)": "Quest , a low-powered , schooner-rigged steamship that sailed from 1917 until sinking in 1962 , is best known as the polar exploration vessel of the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition of 1921-1922 . It was aboard this vessel that Sir Ernest Shackleton died on 5 January 1922 while the vessel was in harbour in South Georgia . Prior to and after the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition , Quest operated in commercial service as a seal-hunting vessel or sealer . Quest was also the primary expedition vessel of the British Arctic Air Route Expedition to the east coast of the island of Greenland in 1930-1931 . Quest was 111 feet ( 34 m ) in length , had a beam of 24 feet ( 7.3 m ) , and 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) depth of hold . The vessel has been variously rated at 209 and 214 gross register tons , possibly due to the 1924 refit described below ."
