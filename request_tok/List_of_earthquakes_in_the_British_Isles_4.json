Richter and presented in his landmark 1935 paper . This was later revised [ how ? ] and renamed the local magnitude scale , denoted as ML or ML . Because of various shortcomings of the ML scale most seismological authorities now use other scales , such as the moment magnitude scale ( Mw ) , to report earthquake magnitudes , but much of the news media still refers to these as Richter magnitudes . All magnitude scales retain the logarithmic character of the original and are scaled to have roughly comparable numeric values ( typically in the middle of the scale ) .",

  "/wiki/UTC": "Coordinated Universal Time ( or UTC ) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time . It is within about 1 second of mean solar time at 0\u00b0 longitude , and is not adjusted for daylight saving time . In some countries , the term Greenwich Mean Time is used . The co-ordination of time and frequency transmissions around the world began on 1 January 1960 . UTC was first officially adopted as CCIR Recommendation 374 , Standard-Frequency and Time-Signal Emissions , in 1963 , but the official abbreviation of UTC and the official English name of Coordinated Universal Time ( along with the French equivalent ) were not adopted until 1967 . The system has been adjusted several times , including a brief period where time coordination radio signals broadcast both UTC and Stepped Atomic Time ( SAT ) before a new UTC was adopted in 1970 and implemented in 1972 . This change also adopted leap seconds to simplify future adjustments . This CCIR Recommendation 460 stated that ( a ) carrier frequencies and time intervals should be maintained constant and should correspond to the definition of the SI second ; ( b ) step adjustments , when necessary , should be exactly 1 s to maintain approximate agreement with Universal Time ( UT ) ; and ( c ) standard signals should contain information on the difference between UTC and UT . A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds . A decision whether to remove them altogether has been deferred until 2023 . The current version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunications Union Recommendation ( ITU-R TF.460-6 ) , Standard-frequency and time-signal emissions , and is based on International Atomic Time ( TAI ) with leap seconds added at irregular intervals to compensate for the slowing of the Earth 's rotation .

Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west .

Throughout the Medieval and Early Modern period , Blackpool was a coastal hamlet in Lancashire 's Hundred of Amounderness , and remained such until the mid-18th century when it became fashionable in England to travel to the coast in the summer to improve well-being . In 1781 , visitors attracted to Blackpool 's 7-mile ( 11 km ) sandy beach were able to use a new private road , built by Thomas Clifton and Sir Henry Hoghton . Stagecoaches began running to Blackpool from Manchester in the same year , and from Halifax in 1782 . In the early 19th century , Henry Banks and his son-in-law John Cocker erected new buildings in Blackpool such that its population grew from less than 500 in 1801 to over 2,500 in 1851 . St John 's Church in Blackpool was consecrated in 1821 . Blackpool rose to prominence as a major centre of tourism in England when a railway was built in the 1840s connecting it to the industrialised regions of Northern England . The railway made it much easier and cheaper for visitors to reach Blackpool , triggering an influx of settlers , such that in 1876 Blackpool was incorporated as a borough , governed by its own town council and aldermen . In 1881 , Blackpool was a booming resort with a population of 14,000 and a promenade complete with piers , fortune-tellers , public houses , trams , donkey rides , fish-and-chip shops and theatres . By 1901 the population of Blackpool was 47,000 , by which time its place was cemented as the archetypal British seaside resort .",
  "/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing": "Hydraulic fracturing ( also called fracking , fracing , hydrofracking , fraccing , frac'ing , and hydrofracturing ) is a well stimulation technique in which rock is fractured by a pressurized liquid . The process involves the high-pressure injection of 'fracking fluid ' ( primarily water , containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents ) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations through which natural gas , petroleum , and brine will flow more freely . When the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well , small grains of hydraulic fracturing proppants ( either sand or aluminium oxide ) hold the fractures open . Hydraulic fracturing began as an experiment in 1947 , and the first commercially successful application followed in 1950 . As of 2012 , 2.5 million frac jobs had been performed worldwide on oil and gas wells ; over one million of those within the U.S . Such treatment is generally necessary to achieve adequate flow rates in shale gas , tight gas , tight oil , and coal seam gas wells . Some hydraulic fractures can form naturally in certain veins or dikes . Drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made the United States a major crude oil exporter as of 2019 , while helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions . Improvements in the national economy and better prices for consumers have been a result of the decade-long fracking boom . Hydraulic fracturing is highly controversial . Its proponents advocate the economic benefits of more extensively accessible hydrocarbons , as well as replacing coal with natural gas , which burns cleaner and emits half as much carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . Opponents of fracking argue that these are outweighed by the potential environmental impacts , which include risks of ground water and surface water contamination , noise and air pollution , and the triggering of earthquakes , along with the resulting hazards to public health and the environment ."
