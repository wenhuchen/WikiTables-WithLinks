  "/wiki/Blaster_(flamethrower)": "The Blaster ( also called the BMW Flamethrower ) was a 1998 invention by South African inventor Charl Fourie designed to provide a defence against carjackings . The invention came in response to the increasingly severe violent crime situation in South Africa , which in 1998 had already made the country ( particularly Johannesburg ) the per capita murder , assault , rape and carjacking capital of the world . The Blaster was a liquefied petroleum gas flamethrower installed along the sides of the vehicle under the doors . Should a group of carjackers suddenly attack the vehicle while it is stopped in traffic ( the typical scenario ) , the occupant could flip a switch and direct 5 metre plumes of flame upward into the facial area of anyone trying to enter the vehicle through the doors or windows . Fourie claims it is unlikely to kill but would definitely blind the assailant . In South Africa , it is legal to use lethal force in self-defence if in fear of one 's life , and ownership of flamethrowers is unrestricted . [ citation needed ] The device was controversial in South Africa , with some ( including the Automobile Association of South Africa [ AA ] ) speculating that the device might cause more carjackers to simply murder drivers with gunfire as a precautionary measure before approaching the vehicle , a tactic which was already fairly common . In any case , the device was not banned ( as is sometimes reported ) , but the high price tag limited its market and made it unprofitable . By 2001 , only a few hundred had been sold , and the device was taken off the market by Fourie , who instead started marketing a less expensive pocket-sized personal flamethrower . 2009 statistics report the murder rate in South Africa has decreased by nearly 50% since 1999 , but the assault rate has stayed steady and the carjacking and rape rates have increased , remaining the highest per capita in the world , and there is still some use of Blaster-equipped vehicles in Johannesburg and elsewhere . The Blaster received ample ( and often satirical ) media coverage from abroad . In particular , it earned its inventor the 1999 Ig Nobel Peace Prize ( a parody of the real Nobel Prizes ) .",
  "/wiki/South_Africa": "South Africa , officially the Republic of South Africa ( RSA ) , is the southernmost country in Africa . It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho . South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

  "/wiki/M48_Patton": "The M48 Patton is an American first generation main battle tank ( MBT ) introduced in February 1951 . It was designed as a replacement for the M26 Pershing , M4 Sherman variants and M46 Pattons used in the Korean War , and as the successor to the M47 Patton . Nearly 12,000 M48s were built , mainly by Chrysler and AlCo , from 1952 to 1961 . The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life . This led to a wide variety of suspension systems , cupola styles , power packs , fenders and other details among individual tanks . The early designs , up to the M48A2C , were powered by a gasoline engine . The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine , however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units . Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in various Arab-Israeli conflicts and the Vietnam War . Beginning in 1959 , most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model . The M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported . The tank 's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical , utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers . Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units , and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s .",

The Ronson was developed by the British Petroleum Warfare Department in 1940 . Having insufficient range it was passed over for British use but taken up by the Canadians for further work . The Ronson was sufficiently developed in time to be used for production of the Wasp MkIIC flamethrower variant of the Universal Carrier . From there it came to the attention of the United States and was adopted as the Satan . The United States used an M4 Sherman tank adapted with a Navy Mark 1 flamethrower , which was a development of the Ronson by the United States Navy . These tanks were used in the Battle of Iwo Jima and during Operation Overlord . The Navy Mark I was also used on the Landing Vehicle Tracked LVT ( 4 ) .",
