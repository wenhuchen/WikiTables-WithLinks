It is one of the oldest plantations in the South , and listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Magnolia Plantation is located near Charleston and directly across the Ashley River from North Charleston . The house and gardens are open daily ; an admission fee is charged . The plantation dates to 1676 , when Thomas and Ann Drayton ( n\u00e9e Anna Fox ) built a house and small formal garden on the site . ( The plantation remains under the control of the Drayton family after 15 generations . [ citation needed ] ) Some of the enslaved people who were forced to work at the house were brought by the Draytons from Barbados in the 1670s . The historic Drayton Hall was built in 1738 by John Drayton , father of judge John Drayton , Jr. , on an adjoining property . Magnolia was originally a rice plantation , with extensive earthworks of dams and dikes built in fields along the river for irrigating land for rice cultivation . African slaves from rice-growing regions created the works . As time went on , these slaves developed a creolized Gullah language and vibrant culture , strongly influenced by their West African cultures . They have retained many combined cultural elements from West Africa to this day in what is known as the Gullah Heritage Corridor of the Lowcountry and Sea Islands of the Carolinas and Georgia .",

The headquarters of the Beaufort-Jasper Water and Sewer Authority are located in Okatie , as are the Beaufort-Jasper Academy for Career Excellence and John Paul II Catholic High School . Okatie is an unincorporated area stretching from southcentral Jasper County to western Beaufort County , between I-95 and SC 462 . It was designated a voting precinct on March 1 , 1916 , by the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina . Portions of Okatie have been annexed by Bluffton , Hardeeville and Port Royal . South Carolina Highway 170 ( also known as Okatie Highway ) is generally considered to be the main route through Okatie . Okatie has experienced predominantly low-density residential development since the 1990s , including Sun City Hilton Head , Riverbend , and Oldfield . Additional commercial and low intensity industrial development have also occurred , primarily in the Jasper County sections of Okatie . This development pattern has resulted in concerns over water quality and loss of forest habitat for wildlife . Previous efforts to incorporate the community have been unsuccessful , due in part to conflicting opinions on the future of growth and development in the area . [ citation needed ]",
