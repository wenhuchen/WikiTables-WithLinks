It is estimated to have suffered 1,394,000 casualties ( killed and wounded ) during the Vietnam War . The ARVN began as a post-colonial army trained and closely affiliated with the United States and had engaged in conflict since its inception . Several dramatic changes occurred throughout its lifetime , initially from a 'blocking-force ' to a more modern conventional force using helicopter deployment in combat . During the U.S. intervention , the role of the ARVN was marginalised to a defensive role with an incomplete modernisation , and transformed again most notably following Vietnamization as it was up-geared , expanded and reconstructed to fulfill the role of the departing U.S. forces . By 1974 , it had become much more effective with foremost counterinsurgency expert and Nixon adviser Robert Thompson noting that Regular Forces were very well-trained and second only to U.S. and IDF forces in the free world and with General Creighton Abrams remarking that 70% of units were on par with the U.S. Army . However , the withdrawal of American forces through Vietnamization meant the armed forces could not effectively fulfill all the aims of the program and had become completely dependent on U.S. equipment , given it was meant to fulfill the departing role of the United States . At its peak , an estimated 1 in 9 citizens of South Vietnam were enlisted and it had become the fourth-largest army in the world composed of Regular Forces and more voluntary Regional and Village-level militias . Unique in serving a dual military-civilian administrative purpose in direct competition with the Viet Cong , the ARVN had , in addition , become a component of political power and suffered from continual issues of political loyalty appointments , corruption in leadership , factional in-fighting and occasional open internal conflict . After the fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese People 's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) , the ARVN was dissolved . While some high-ranking officers had fled the country to the United States or elsewhere , thousands of former ARVN officers were sent to reeducation camps by the communist government of the new , unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam . Five ARVN generals committed suicide to avoid capture by the PAVN/VC .",

Located at the heart of the Indochinese peninsula , Laos is bordered by Myanmar and China to the northwest , Vietnam to the east , Cambodia to the southeast and Thailand to the west and southwest . Present Laos traces historic and cultural identity to the kingdom of Lan Xang Hom Khao ( Kingdom of a Million Elephants Under the White Parasol ) , which existed from the mid-fourteenth century to early eighteenth century as one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia . Due to its central geographical location in Southeast Asia , the kingdom became a hub for overland trade , turned wealthy economically and culturally . After a period of internal conflict , Lan Xang broke off into three separate kingdoms - Luang Phrabang , Vientiane , and Champasak . In 1893 , the three territories came under French protectorate and were united to form what is now known as Laos . It briefly gained independence in 1945 after Japanese occupation , but was recolonised by France until it won autonomy in 1949 . Laos became independent in 1953 , with a constitutional monarchy under Sisavang Vong . A post-independence civil war began , which saw the communist resistance , supported by the Soviet Union and North Vietnam , fight against the monarchy that later came under influence of military regimes supported by the United States . After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 , the communist Pathet Lao movement came to power , ending the civil war and establishing a one-party state . Laos was then dependent on military and economic aid from the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991 . In 2018 , the country had the fourth highest GDP ( PPP ) per capita in Southeast Asia , after Singapore , Malaysia , and Thailand .",

  "/wiki/Vietnamization": "Vietnamization was a policy of the Richard Nixon administration to end U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War through a program to expand , equip , and train South Vietnamese forces and assign to them an ever-increasing combat role , at the same time steadily reducing the number of U.S. combat troops . Brought on by the Viet Cong 's Tet Offensive , the policy referred to U.S. combat troops specifically in the ground combat role , but did not reject combat by the U.S. Air Force , as well as the support to South Vietnam , consistent with the policies of U.S. foreign military assistance organizations . U.S. citizens ' mistrust of their government that had begun after the offensive worsened with the release of news about U.S. soldiers massacring civilians at My Lai ( 1968 ) , the invasion of Cambodia ( 1970 ) , and the leaking of the Pentagon Papers ( 1971 ) . The name Vietnamization came about accidentally . At a January 28 , 1969 , meeting of the National Security Council , General Andrew Goodpaster , deputy to General Creighton Abrams and commander of the Military Assistance Command , Vietnam , stated that the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) had been steadily improving , and the point at which the war could be de-Americanized was close . Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird agreed with the point , but not with the language : What we need is a term like 'Vietnamizing ' to put the emphasis on the right issues . Nixon immediately liked Laird 's word . Vietnamization fit into the broader d\u00e9tente policy of the Nixon administration , in which the United States no longer regarded its fundamental strategy as the containment of communism but as a cooperative world order , in which Nixon and his chief adviser Henry Kissinger were focused on the broader constellation of forces [ clarification needed ] and the bigger world powers . Nixon had ordered Kissinger to negotiate diplomatic policies with Soviet statesman Anatoly Dobrynin . Nixon also opened high-level contact with China . U.S. relations with the Soviet Union and China were of higher priority than South Vietnam . Nixon said Vietnamization had two components .",
