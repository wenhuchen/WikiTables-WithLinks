  "/wiki/Be_My_Baby": "Be My Baby is a song written by Jeff Barry , Ellie Greenwich , and Phil Spector . It was recorded on July 5 , 1963 at Gold Star Studios Hollywood by American girl group the Ronettes and released as a single in August 1963 and later placed on their 1964 debut LP Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes featuring Veronica . Ronnie Spector is the only Ronette to appear on the single ; her future husband Phil produced their elaborately layered recording in what is now considered a quintessential example of his Wall of Sound production formula . It is considered one of the best songs of the 1960s by NME , Time , and Pitchfork staff members . In 2004 , the song was ranked 22 by Rolling Stone in its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and described as a Rosetta stone for studio pioneers such as the Beatles and Brian Wilson , a notion supported by AllMusic who writes , No less an authority than Brian Wilson has declared 'Be My Baby ' the greatest pop record ever made - no arguments here . In 1999 , it was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame , and in 2006 , the Library of Congress honored the Ronettes ' version by adding it to the United States National Recording Registry . In 2017 , Billboard named the song number 1 on their list of the 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time .",
  "/wiki/Phil_Spector": "Phillip Harvey Spector ( born Harvey Phillip Spector , December 26 , 1939 ) is an American record producer , musician , and songwriter who developed the Wall of Sound , a music production formula he described as a Wagnerian approach to rock and roll . Spector was dubbed the First Tycoon of Teen by writer Tom Wolfe and is acknowledged as one of the most influential figures in pop music history . After the 1970s , Spector mostly retired from public life . In 2009 , he was convicted of second-degree murder and has remained incarcerated since . Born in the Bronx , Spector began his career in 1958 as co-founder , guitarist , and vocalist of the Teddy Bears , penning their US number-one single To Know Him Is to Love Him . In 1960 , he co-founded Philles Records , and at the age of 21 , became the youngest ever US label owner to that point . Over the next several years , he wrote , co-wrote , or produced records for acts such as the Ronettes and the Crystals , and later , John Lennon and George Harrison of the Beatles . He often employed what would become known as the Wrecking Crew as his de facto house band while collaborating with arranger Jack Nitzsche , engineer Larry Levine , and various Brill Building songwriters . Spector 's other chart-topping singles include You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' ( co-written and produced for the Righteous Brothers , 1964 ) , The Long and Winding Road ( produced for the Beatles , 1970 ) , and My Sweet Lord ( produced for Harrison , 1970 ) . Spector is considered the first auteur among musical artists for the unprecedented freedom and control he had over every phase of the recording process . Additionally , he helped engender the idea of the studio as an instrument , the integration of pop art aesthetics into music ( art pop ) , and the art rock genre . His honors include the 1973 Grammy Award for Album of the Year for co-producing Harrison 's Concert for Bangladesh ( 1971 ) , a 1989 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , and a 1997 induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame .",
