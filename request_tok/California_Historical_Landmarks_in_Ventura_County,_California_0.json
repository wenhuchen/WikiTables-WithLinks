  "/wiki/Ventura,_California": "Ventura , officially the City of San Buenaventura , is the county seat of Ventura County , California , United States . The coastal site , set against undeveloped hills and flanked by two free-flowing rivers , has been inhabited for thousands of years . European explorers encountered a Chumash village , referred to as Shisholop , here while traveling along the Pacific coast . They witnessed the ocean navigation skill of the native people and their use of the abundant local resources from sea and land . ( p36 ) The eponymous Mission San Buenaventura was founded nearby in 1782 where it benefitted from the water of the Ventura River . The town grew around the mission compound and incorporated in 1866 . The development of nearby oil fields in the 1920s and the age of automobile travel created a major real estate boom during which many designated landmark buildings were constructed . The mission and these buildings are at the center of a downtown that has become a cultural , retail , and residential district and visitor destination . Ventura lies between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara along U.S. Route 101 , which was one of the original U.S . Routes . The highway is now known as the Ventura Freeway , but the original route through the town along Main Street has been designated El Camino Real , the historic pathway connecting the California missions . During the post-World War II economic expansion , the community grew easterly , building detached single-family homes over the rich agricultural land created by the Santa Clara River at the edge of the Oxnard Plain .",
  "/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",

  "/wiki/San_Buenaventura_Mission_Aqueduct": "The San Buenaventura Mission Aqueduct was a seven-mile long , stone and mortar aqueduct built in the late 18th and/or early 19th century to transport water from the Ventura River to the Mission San Buenaventura in Ventura , California . Accounts vary greatly as to when the aqueduct was built . One account indicates it was built between 1780 and 1790 by the Chumash Indians under the direction of a Spanish priest trained in hydrology . Others place its construction in the 1790s , and yet another indicates it was built between 1805 and 1815 by stonemasons brought from Mexico . The aqueduct supplied water for the residents of Mission San Buenaventura and irrigation for the mission 's pasture and agricultural lands . Water from the aqueduct helped the mission flourish . Few vestiges of it remain today . Large sections were destroyed in a Great Flood of 1862 , and settlers used stones from the old aqueduct to build homes . The combined effects of floods , land cultivation , neglect and land development reduced most of the aqueduct to rubble . The only significant section that remains is located at the mouth of Canyada canyon on land that was formerly known as Rancho Ca\u00f1ada Larga o Verde owned by the Canet family from 1873 until at least the 1960s . This remaining section is 100 feet long and ten feet high , and is believed to have served as a siphon , drawing water uphill through conduits .
