  "/wiki/Logopandecteision": "Logopandecteision is a 1653 book by Sir Thomas Urquhart , detailing his plans for the creation of an artificial language by that name . The book is written in several parts , most notably including a list of the language 's 66 unparalleled excellences ; the rest is made up of rants against his creditors , the Church of Scotland , and others whose neglect and wrongdoings prevent him from publishing this perfected language . Where the book deals with the plan of Logopandecteision , it recalls his earlier work Eskybalauron . Urquhart was fond of this kind of very elaborate joke , sometimes so elaborate as to be taken by his contemporaries as in earnest . In this case , it is posterity which mistakes his intention . Under the spelling Logopandekteision extracts are sometimes presented which make it appear that Urquhart seriously undertook the creation of a constructed language . These extracts are somewhat reminiscent of the teetering taxonomic structures of other philosophical languages , and of the baroque grammar of later projects such as Volap\u00fck . He promises twelve parts of speech : each declinable in eleven cases , four numbers , eleven genders ( including god , goddess , man , woman , animal , etc . ) ; and conjugable in eleven tenses , seven moods , and four voices . So far as that his project is possible , if absurd . He goes on to make other promises not so easily fulfilled : that here is no Language in the world , but for every word thereof , it will afford you another of the same signification , of equal syllables with it , and beginning or ending , or both , with vowels or consonants as it doth ; that in translating verses of any vernaculary tongue , such as Italian , French , Spanish , Slavonian , Dutch , Irish , English , or whatever it be , it affords you of the same signification , syllable for syllable , and in the closure of each line a rime , as in the original ; that any number , of any magnitude whatsoever , may be expressed in this language by a single word , in fact so concisely that the number of sand-grains required to fill Earth and Heaven would be expressible by two letters ; and perhaps most extraordinarily , that his language will translate any idiom in any other language , without any alteration of the literal sense , but fully representing the intention .",

  "/wiki/An_Essay_towards_a_Real_Character_and_a_Philosophical_Language": "An Essay Towards a Real Character , and a Philosophical Language ( London , 1668 ) is the best-remembered of the numerous works of John Wilkins , in which he expounds a new universal language , meant primarily to facilitate international communication among scholars , but envisioned for use by diplomats , travelers , and merchants as well . Unlike many universal language schemes of the period , it was meant merely as an auxiliary to - not a replacement of - existing natural languages . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/John_Wilkins": "John Wilkins , FRS ( 1614-1672 ) was an Anglican clergyman , natural philosopher and author , and was one of the founders of the Royal Society . He was Bishop of Chester from 1668 until his death . Wilkins is one of the few persons to have headed a college at both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge . He was a polymath , although not one of the most important scientific innovators of the period . His personal qualities were brought out , and obvious to his contemporaries , in reducing political tension in Interregnum Oxford , in founding the Royal Society on non-partisan lines , and in efforts to reach out to religious nonconformists . He was one of the founders of the new natural theology compatible with the science of the time . He is particularly known for An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language ( 1668 ) in which , amongst other things , he proposed a universal language and an integrated system of measurement , similar to the metric system . Wilkins lived in a period of great political and religious controversy , yet managed to remain on working terms with men of all political stripes ; he was key in setting the Church of England on the path toward comprehension for as many sects as possible , and toleration for the rest . Gilbert Burnet called him the wisest clergyman I ever knew . He was a lover of mankind , and had a delight in doing good . His stepdaughter married John Tillotson , who became Archbishop of Canterbury .",
  "/wiki/Isotype_(pictograms)": "Isotype ( International System of Typographic Picture Education ) is a method of showing social , technological , biological , and historical connections in pictorial form . It consists of a set of standardized and abstracted pictorial symbols to represent social-scientific data with specific guidelines on how to combine the identical figures using serial repetition . It was first known as the Vienna Method of Pictorial Statistics ( Wiener Methode der Bildstatistik ) , due to its having been developed at the Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum in Wien ( Social and Economic Museum of Vienna ) between 1925 and 1934 . The founding director of this museum , Otto Neurath , was the initiator and chief theorist of the Vienna Method . Gerd Arntz was the artist responsible for realising the graphics . The term Isotype was applied to the method around 1935 , after its key practitioners were forced to leave Vienna by the rise of Austrian fascism .",
  "/wiki/Pictograph": "A pictogram , also called a pictogramme , pictograph , or simply picto , and in computer usage an icon , is an ideogram that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblance to a physical object . Pictographs are often used in writing and graphic systems in which the characters are to a considerable extent pictorial in appearance . A pictogram may also be used in subjects such as leisure , tourism , and geography . Pictography is a form of writing [ citation needed ] which uses representational , pictorial drawings , similarly to cuneiform and , to some extent , hieroglyphic writing , which also uses drawings as phonetic letters or determinative rhymes . Some pictograms , such as Hazards pictograms , are elements of formal languages . Pictograph has a rather different meaning in the field of prehistoric art , including recent art by traditional societies and then means art painted on rock surfaces , as opposed to petroglyphs ; the latter are carved or incised . Such images may or may not be considered pictograms in the general sense .",
  "/wiki/Loglan": "Loglan is a constructed language originally designed for linguistic research , particularly for investigating the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis . The language was developed beginning in 1955 by Dr James Cooke Brown with the goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true . In 1960 Scientific American published an article introducing the language . Loglan is the first among , and the main inspiration for , the languages known as logical languages , which also includes Lojban . Brown founded The Loglan Institute ( TLI ) to develop the language and other applications of it . He always considered the language an incomplete research project , and although he released many papers about its design , he continued to claim legal restrictions on its use . Because of this , a group of his followers later formed the Logical Language Group to create the language Lojban along the same principles , but with the intention to make it freely available and encourage its use as a real language . Supporters of Lojban use the term Loglan as a generic term to refer to both their own language , and Brown 's Loglan , referred to as TLI Loglan when in need of disambiguation . Although the non-trademarkability of the term Loglan was eventually upheld by the United States Patent and Trademark Office , many supporters and members of The Loglan Institute find this usage offensive , and reserve Loglan for the TLI version of the language .",
  "/wiki/James_Cooke_Brown": "Dr. James Cooke Brown ( July 21 , 1921 - February 13 , 2000 ) was an American sociologist and science fiction author . He is notable for creating the artificial language Loglan and for designing the Parker Brothers board game Careers . Brown 's novel The Troika Incident ( Doubleday , 1970 ) describes a worldwide free knowledge base similar to the Internet . The novel begins with the belief that the world is on the eve of self-destruction , but then it presents a world about a century from now which is a paradise of peace and prosperity , all based on ideas , movements , and knowledge presently available in the world . In its metafictional structure , the novel is a call for social change , not through revolution but through free education and the resilience of human ingenuity . Long out of print and relatively rare , an e-book version ( Amazon Kindle ) of the novel was released in 2012 . The novel envisioned all books and periodicals being viewed on portable electronic devices called readers in the year 2070 , when it is set . Among his other achievements , Brown designed , and had built , a three-hulled sailboat , called a trimaran . He utilized this boat to sail to many parts of the world . While on a South American cruise with his wife , Brown was admitted to a hospital in Argentina , where he died at the age of 78 .",
  "/wiki/Sapir\u2013Whorf_hypothesis": "The hypothesis of linguistic relativity , part of relativism , also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis /s\u0259\u02ccp\u026a\u0259r \u02c8hw\u0254\u02d0rf/ , or Whorfianism is a principle claiming that the structure of a language affects its speakers ' world view or cognition , and thus people 's perceptions are relative to their spoken language . The principle is often defined in one of two versions : the strong hypothesis , which was held by some of the early linguists before World War II , and the weak hypothesis , mostly held by some of the modern linguists .",
  "/wiki/AUI_(language)": "aUI ( IPA : /aui/ ) is a philosophical , a priori language created in the 1950s by W. John Weilgart , Ph.D. ( March 9 , 1913- January 26 , 1981 ; born Johann Wolfgang Weixlg\u00e4rtner , and also known as John W. Weilgart ) a philosopher and psychoanalyst originally from Vienna , Austria . He described it as the Language of Space , connoting universal communication , and published the fourth edition of the textbook in 1979 ; a philosophic description of each semantic element of the language was published in 1975 . As an effort toward world 'peace through understanding ' , it was Weilgart 's goal to clarify and simplify communication . Ultimately it was his experiment in facilitating conscious thinking in that it is built from a proposed set of primitive , possibly universal elements that are designed to reflect a motivated , mnemonic relationship between symbol , sound , and meaning . In his psychotherapy work , he sometimes used client created aUI formulations to reveal possible subconscious associations to problematic concepts . aUI can also be considered an experiment in applied cognitive lexical semantics , and Weilgart claimed it could serve as an auxiliary language .",
  "/wiki/Ithkuil": "Ithkuil is an experimental constructed language created by American linguist John Quijada . It is designed to express deeper levels of human cognition briefly yet overtly and clearly , particularly with regard to human categorization . It is a cross between an a priori philosophical and a logical language . It tries to minimize the ambiguities and semantic vagueness found in natural human languages . Ithkuil is notable for its grammatical complexity and extensive phoneme inventory , the latter being simplified in the final version of the language . The name Ithkuil is an anglicized form of I\u0163ku\u00eel , which in the original form roughly means hypothetical representation of a language . Quijada states he did not create Ithkuil to be auxiliary or used in everyday conversations . He wanted the language to be used for more elaborate and profound fields where more insightful thoughts are expected , such as philosophy , arts , science and politics . Meaningful phrases or sentences can usually be expressed in Ithkuil with fewer linguistic units than in natural languages . For example , the two-word Ithkuil sentence Tram-m\u013c\u00f6i hh\u00e2sma\u0159p\u0163ukt\u00f4x can be translated into English as On the contrary , I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point . Quijada sees his strictly regular creation as too complex to have developed naturally , but nonetheless as a language suited to human conversation . No person , including Quijada himself , is known to be able to speak Ithkuil fluently .",
  "/wiki/L\u00e1adan": "L\u00e1adan is a feminist constructed language created by Suzette Haden Elgin in 1982 to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis , specifically to determine if development of a language aimed at expressing the views of women would shape a culture ; a subsidiary hypothesis was that Western natural languages may be better suited for expressing the views of men than women . The language was included in her science fiction Native Tongue series . L\u00e1adan contains a number of words that are used to make unambiguous statements that include how one feels about what one is saying . According to Elgin , this is designed to counter male-centered language 's limitations on women , who are forced to respond I know I said that , but I meant this .",

  "/wiki/Tonal_language": "Tone is the use of pitch in language to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning - that is , to distinguish or to inflect words . All verbal languages use pitch to express emotional and other paralinguistic information and to convey emphasis , contrast , and other such features in what is called intonation , but not all languages use tones to distinguish words or their inflections , analogously to consonants and vowels . Languages that do have this feature are called tonal languages ; the distinctive tone patterns of such a language are sometimes called tonemes , by analogy with phoneme . Tonal languages are common in East and Southeast Asia , the Pacific , Africa , and the Americas ; as many as seventy percent of world languages may be tonal .",
  "/wiki/Lojban": "Lojban ( pronounced [ \u02c8lo\u0292ban ] ( listen ) ) is a constructed , syntactically unambiguous human language created by the Logical Language Group and succeeding the Loglan project .

The LLG sought to realize Loglan 's purposes , and further improve the language by making it more usable and freely available ( as indicated by its official full English title , Lojban : A Realization of Loglan ) . After a long initial period of debating and testing , the baseline was completed in 1997 , and published as The Complete Lojban Language . In an interview in 2010 with The New York Times , Arika Okrent , the author of In the Land of Invented Languages , stated : The constructed language with the most complete grammar is probably Lojban - a language created to reflect the principles of logic . Lojban is proposed as a speakable language for communication between people of different language backgrounds , as a potential means of machine translation and to explore the intersection of human language and software .",
  "/wiki/Syntactic_ambiguity": "Syntactic ambiguity , also called structural ambiguity , amphiboly or amphibology , is a situation where a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous sentence structure . Syntactic ambiguity arises not from the range of meanings of single words , but from the relationship between the words and clauses of a sentence , and the sentence structure underlying the word order therein . In other words , a sentence is syntactically ambiguous when a reader or listener can reasonably interpret one sentence as having more than one possible structure . In legal disputes , courts may be asked to interpret the meaning of syntactic ambiguities in statutes or contracts . In some instances , arguments asserting highly unlikely interpretations have been deemed frivolous . [ citation needed ] A set of possible parse trees for an ambiguous sentence is called a parse forest . The process of resolving syntactic ambiguity is called syntactic disambiguation .",

  "/wiki/K\u0113len": "K\u0113len is a constructed language created by Sylvia Sotomayor . It is an attempt to create a truly alien language by violating a key linguistic universal - namely that all human languages have verbs . In K\u0113len , relationships between the noun phrases making up the sentence are expressed by one of four relationals . According to Sotomayor , these relationals perform the functions of verbs but lack any of the semantic content . However , the semantic content found in common verbs , such as those that are semantic primes , can also be found in K\u0113len 's relationals , which calls into question whether K\u0113len is technically verbless . Despite its distinctive grammar , K\u0113len is an expressive and intelligible language ; [ citation needed ] texts written in K\u0113len have been translated into other languages by several people other than the creator of the language , as may be seen here .

  "/wiki/Verb": "A verb , from the Latin verbum meaning word , is a word ( part of speech ) that in syntax conveys an action ( bring , read , walk , run , learn ) , an occurrence ( happen , become ) , or a state of being ( be , exist , stand ) . In the usual description of English , the basic form , with or without the particle to , is the infinitive . In many languages , verbs are inflected ( modified in form ) to encode tense , aspect , mood , and voice . A verb may also agree with the person , gender or number of some of its arguments , such as its subject , or object . Verbs have tenses : present , to indicate that an action is being carried out ; past , to indicate that an action has been done ; future , to indicate that an action will be done ."
