  "/wiki/Cardiff_Railway": "From 1839 the Trustees of the Marquis of Bute , operated a large dock operation in Cardiff , the Bute Docks . This was very successful , but was overwhelmed by the huge volume of coal exported through Cardiff . At the same time it was seen that railway companies , especially the Taff Vale Railway ( TVR ) , were making money conveying the coal to the docks . The Bute Docks company decided to built a railway from Pontypridd to their dock ; they obtained Parliamentary authority for part of the route in 1898 , and changed the company name to the Cardiff Railway . To be successful , they needed to make a junction with their main rival , the TVR , at Treforest . A single mineral train traversed the junction in 1909 but legal challenges prevented any further use . The Cardiff Railway had built an expensive railway line that failed to connect with the collieries beyond Pontypridd . The company became part of the Great Western Railway ( as did the TVR ) in 1923 . A low-key passenger service was operated , and a colliery at Nantgarw was served until 1952 . The passenger service was cut back to Coryton in 1931 and continues to operate today .",

There was considerable demand for dock accommodation in Newport , South Wales , chiefly for the export or coastal transport of iron ore and coal . The Newport Dock Company had built an earlier dock that was now outgrown . Changing demand , particularly for blending coal , created a need to bring coal to Newport from the Taff and Cynon valleys , and the Pontypridd , Caerphilly and Newport Railway was formed to build the line ; nominally independent , it shared many directors and major shareholders . It opened in 1884 , and was absorbed by the ADR in 1897 . Prior to 1914 the Alexandra Docks were superlative in the world in terms of water area within the docks and ability to handle large vessels . The decline of the mineral extractive industries of South Wales resulted in a corresponding decline of activity by the ADR and its successor owners . However it is now active and successful as a general dock facility as part of Associated British Ports .",

The society that operates the line started steam locomotive operations in 1971 , and bought the trackbed and line from British Rail in 1986 , reaching both Lydney Junction and Parkend railway stations by 1995 and 2005 respectively . Trains are operated by both steam and heritage diesel locomotives , and heritage diesel multiple units . The Dean Forest Railway has been given the former GWR signal box that stood slightly to the east of Codsall station in Staffordshire . Its removal was completed in July 2007 , and was placed at the newly restored Whitecroft railway station . The Dean Forest Railway has also been given the former Griffithstown Station building . Its removal was completed in June 2016 , and is expected to be placed at the new upcoming Speech House Road . CrossCountry are now providing a combined fare for travel to Lydney mainline station ( on CrossCountry services only ) and then onto the Dean Forest Railway .
