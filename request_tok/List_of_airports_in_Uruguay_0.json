The Air Navigation Commission ( ANC ) is the technical body within ICAO . The Commission is composed of 19 Commissioners , nominated by the ICAO 's contracting states and appointed by the ICAO Council . Commissioners serve as independent experts , who although nominated by their states , do not serve as state or political representatives .
