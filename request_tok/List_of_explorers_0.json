  "/wiki/Portuguese_people": "Portuguese people are a Romance ethnic group indigenous to Portugal who share a common Portuguese culture , ancestry and language . Their predominant religion is Christianity , mainly Roman Catholicism , though large segments of the population , especially the younger generations , have no religious affiliation . The Portuguese people 's heritage largely derives from the pre-Celts ( Lusitanians , Conii ) and Celts ( Gallaecians , Turduli and Celtici ) , who were Romanized after the conquest of the region by the ancient Romans . A number of Portuguese can also trace minor descent from Germanic tribes who arrived after the Roman period as ruling elites , namely the Suebi , Vandals and Visigoths , who ruled for circa three hundred years . Finally , the Moorish occupation left a genetic contribution in the Iberian Peninsula , especially in western and southern regions . The Roman Republic conquered the Iberian Peninsula during the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C . from the extensive maritime empire of Carthage during the series of Punic Wars . As a result of Roman colonization , the Portuguese language stems primarily from Vulgar Latin . Due to the large historical extent from the 16th century of the Portuguese Empire and the subsequent colonization of territories in Asia , Africa and the Americas , as well as historical and recent emigration , Portuguese communities can be found in many diverse regions around the globe , and a large Portuguese diaspora exists . Portuguese people began an Age of Exploration which started in 1415 with the conquest of Ceuta and culminated in an empire with territories that are now part of over 50 countries . The Portuguese Empire lasted nearly 600 years , seeing its end when Macau was returned to China in 1999 . The discovery of several lands unknown to Europeans in the Americas , Africa , Asia and Oceania ( southwest Pacific Ocean ) , forged the Portuguese Empire described as the first global empire in history , also paving the way for the domination of Western civilisation by other neighbouring European nations .",

  "/wiki/English_people": "The English people are a nation and an ethnic group native to England who speak the English language . The English identity is of early medieval origin , when they were known in Old English as the Angelcynn ( family of the Angles ) . Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles , one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD . England is the largest and most populous country of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , and the majority of people living there are British citizens . The English largely descend from two main historical population groups - the earlier Celtic Britons ( or Brythons ) and the Germanic tribes who settled in Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans : the Angles , Saxons , Jutes and Frisians . Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons , they founded what was to become the Kingdom of England ( from the Old English Englaland ) by the early 10th century , in response to the invasion and minor settlement of Danes beginning in the late 9th century . This was followed by the Norman Conquest and limited settlement of Anglo-Normans in England in the latter 11th century . In the Acts of Union 1707 , the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to become the Kingdom of Great Britain . Over the years , English customs and identity have become fairly closely aligned with British customs and identity in general . The English people are the source of the English language , the Westminster system , the common law system and numerous major sports such as cricket , football , rugby union , rugby league and tennis . These and other English cultural characteristics have spread worldwide , in part as a result of the former British Empire .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

As of 2018 , the region had a population of over 100 million people . Through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , English and European sources often referred to the region as the Barbary Coast or the Barbary States , a term derived from the Berbers . Sometimes , the region is referred to as the Land of the Atlas , derived from the Atlas Mountains found in the region . In Berber languages , Tamazgha refers to the Maghreb region together with smaller parts of Mali , Niger , Egypt , and the Spanish Canary Islands - the lands traditionally inhabited by Arab-Berbers . The Maghreb is usually defined as much of northern Africa , including a large portion of Africa 's Sahara Desert , but excludes Egypt and Sudan , which are considered to be in the Mashriq , the eastern part of the Arab world . The traditional definition of the Maghreb , which restricted it to the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plains of Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , and Libya , was expanded by the inclusion of Mauritania and the disputed territory of Western Sahara . During the era of Al-Andalus in the Iberian Peninsula ( 711-1492 ) , the Maghreb 's inhabitants , the Muslim Berbers or Maghrebi , were known by Europeans as Moors , or as Afariqah ( Roman Africans ) . [ need quotation to verify ] Morocco transliterates into Arabic as al-Maghreb ( The Maghreb ) .

Arabic is also widely spoken , arguably the largest minority language in France as of the 21st century ( a spot previously held by Breton and Occitan ) . Modern French society is a melting pot . From the middle of the 19th century , it experienced a high rate of inward migration , mainly consisting of Arab-Berbers , Jews , Sub-Saharan Africans , Chinese , and other peoples from Africa , the Middle East and East Asia , and the government , defining France as an inclusive nation with universal values , advocated assimilation through which immigrants were expected to adhere to French values and cultural norms .

Afonso advanced the three-fold Portuguese grand scheme of combating Islam , spreading Christianity , and securing the trade of spices by establishing a Portuguese Asian empire . Among his achievements , Afonso managed to conquer Goa and was the first European of the Renaissance to raid the Persian Gulf , and he led the first voyage by a European fleet into the Red Sea . His military and administrative works are generally regarded as among the most vital to building and securing the Portuguese Empire in the Orient , the Middle East , and the spice routes of eastern Oceania . Afonso is generally considered a military genius , and probably the greatest naval commander of the age given his successful strategy - he attempted to close all the Indian Ocean naval passages to the Atlantic , Red Sea , Persian Gulf , and to the Pacific , transforming it into a Portuguese mare clausum established over the opposition of the Ottoman Empire and its Muslim and Hindu allies . In the expansion of the Portuguese Empire , Afonso initiated a rivalry that would become known as the Ottoman-Portuguese war , which would endure for many years . Many of the Ottoman-Portuguese conflicts in which he was directly involved took place in the Indian Ocean , in the Persian Gulf regions for control of the trade routes , and on the coasts of India . It was his military brilliance in these initial campaigns against the much larger Ottoman Empire and its allies that enabled Portugal to become the first global empire in history . He had a record of engaging and defeating much larger armies and fleets . For example , his capture of Ormuz in 1507 against the Persians was accomplished with a fleet of seven ships . Other famous battles and offensives which he led include the conquest of Goa in 1510 and the capture of Malacca in 1511 .

The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago , not long after Earth . The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia . New research of Moon rocks , although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis , suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought . The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth , and thus always shows the same side to Earth , the near side . Because of libration , slightly more than half ( about 59% ) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from Earth . The near side is marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters .

The kingdom was founded and initially ruled by the royal Argead dynasty , which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties . Home to the ancient Macedonians , the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula , and bordered by Epirus to the west , Paeonia to the north , Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south . Before the 4th century BC , Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens , Sparta and Thebes , and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia . During the reign of the Argead king Philip II ( 359-336 BC ) , Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom through conquest and diplomacy . With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the sarissa pike , Philip II defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC . Philip II 's son Alexander the Great , leading a federation of Greek states , accomplished his father 's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted . During Alexander 's subsequent campaign of conquest , he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River . For a brief period , his empire was the most powerful in the world - the definitive Hellenistic state , inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization . Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy , engineering , and science spread throughout much of the ancient world . Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle , tutor to Alexander , whose writings became a keystone of Western philosophy .

It forms the western section of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region ( HKH ) and is the westernmost extension of the Pamir Mountains , the Karakoram and the Himalayas . It divides the valley of the Amu Darya ( the ancient Oxus ) to the north from the Indus River valley to the south . The range has numerous high snow-capped peaks , with the highest point being Tirich Mir or Terichmir at 7,708 metres ( 25,289 ft ) in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan . To the north , near its northeastern end , the Hindu Kush buttresses the Pamir Mountains near the point where the borders of China , Pakistan and Afghanistan meet , after which it runs southwest through Pakistan and into Afghanistan near their border . The eastern end of the Hindu Kush in the north merges with the Karakoram Range . Towards its southern end , it connects with the Spin Ghar Range near the Kabul River . The Hindu Kush range region was a historically significant centre of Buddhism with sites such as the Bamiyan Buddhas . It remained a stronghold of polytheistic faiths until the 19th century . The range and communities settled in it hosted ancient monasteries , important trade networks , and travellers between Central Asia and South Asia . The Hindu Kush range has also been the passageway during the invasions of the Indian subcontinent , and continues to be important during modern-era warfare in Afghanistan .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire .

Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century , becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain . Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved by 1841 . From the mid- to late-19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , the authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms . A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship . From 1960 to 1996 , Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the US-backed government and leftist rebels , including genocidal massacres of the Maya population perpetrated by the military . Since a United Nations-negotiated peace accord , Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections , though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty , crime , drug trade , and instability .",

The republic of Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala , to the southwest by El Salvador , to the southeast by Nicaragua , to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca , and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras , a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea . Honduras was home to several important Mesoamerican cultures , most notably the Maya , before the Spanish Colonization in the sixteenth century . The Spanish introduced Roman Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish language , along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture . Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic , although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability , and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere . In 1960 , the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice . The nation 's economy is primarily agricultural , making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . The lower class is primarily agriculturally based while wealth is concentrated in the country 's urban centers . Honduras has a Human Development Index of 0.625 , classifying it as a nation with medium development . When the Index is adjusted for income inequality , its Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is 0.443 . Honduran society is predominantly Mestizo ; however , American Indian , black and white individuals also live in Honduras ( 2017 ) . The nation had a relatively high political stability until its 2009 coup and again with the 2017 presidential election .",

It shares borders with Eritrea to the north , Djibouti to the northeast , Somalia , and the de facto state of Somaliland to the east , Kenya to the south , South Sudan to the west and Sudan to the northwest . With over 109 million inhabitants , Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent with a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres ( 420,000 sq mi ) . Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",

Its capital and largest city is Windhoek , and it is a member state of the United Nations ( UN ) , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the African Union ( AU ) , and the Commonwealth of Nations . Namibia , the driest country in Sub-Saharan Africa , was inhabited since early times by the San , Damara and Nama people . Around the 14th century , immigrating Bantu peoples arrived as part of the Bantu expansion . Since then , the Bantu groups , the largest being the Ovambo , have dominated the population of the country ; since the late 19th century , they have constituted a majority . In 1878 , the Cape of Good Hope , then a British colony , annexed the port of Walvis Bay and the offshore Penguin Islands ; these became an integral part of the new Union of South Africa at its creation in 1910 . In 1884 the German Empire established rule over most of the territory , forming a colony known as German South West Africa . It developed farming and infrastructure .

[ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .

It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere , almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle , and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean . At 14,200,000 square kilometres ( 5,500,000 square miles ) , it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia . At 0.00008 people per square kilometre , it is by far the least densely populated continent . About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km ( 1.2 mi ; 6,200 ft ) in thickness , which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula . Antarctica , on average , is the coldest , driest , and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents . Most of Antarctica is a polar desert , with annual precipitation of 200 mm ( 7.9 in ) along the coast and far less inland ; there has been no rain there for almost 2 million years , yet 80% of the world freshwater reserves are stored there . The temperature in Antarctica has reached \u221289.2 \u00b0C ( \u2212128.6 \u00b0F ) ( or even \u221294.7 \u00b0C ( \u2212135.8 \u00b0F ) as measured from space ) , though the average for the third quarter ( the coldest part of the year ) is \u221263 \u00b0C ( \u221281 \u00b0F ) .

Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae , bacteria , fungi , plants , protista , and certain animals , such as mites , nematodes , penguins , seals and tardigrades . Vegetation , where it occurs , is tundra . Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered , unseen until 1820 when the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the Fimbul ice shelf .",
  "/wiki/Northwest_Passage": "The Northwest Passage ( NWP ) is the sea route to the Pacific Ocean through the Arctic Ocean , along the northern coast of North America via waterways through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago . The eastern route along the Arctic coasts of Norway and Siberia is accordingly called the Northeast Passage ( NEP ) . The various islands of the archipelago are separated from one another and from the Canadian mainland by a series of Arctic waterways collectively known as the Northwest Passages or Northwestern Passages . For centuries , European explorers sought a navigable passage as a possible trade route to Asia . An ice-bound northern route was discovered in 1850 by the Irish explorer Robert McClure ; it was through a more southerly opening in an area explored by the Scotsman John Rae in 1854 that Norwegian Roald Amundsen made the first complete passage in 1903-1906 . Until 2009 , the Arctic pack ice prevented regular marine shipping throughout most of the year . Arctic sea ice decline has rendered the waterways more navigable for ice navigation . The contested sovereignty claims over the waters may complicate future shipping through the region : the Canadian government maintains that the Northwestern Passages are part of Canadian Internal Waters , but the United States and various European countries claim that they are an international strait and transit passage , allowing free and unencumbered passage . If , as has been claimed , parts of the eastern end of the Passage are barely 15 metres ( 49 ft ) deep , the route 's viability as a Euro-Asian shipping route is reduced . In 2016 a Chinese shipping line expressed a desire to make regular voyages of cargo ships using the passage to the eastern United States and Europe , after a successful passage by Nordic Orion of 73,500 tonnes deadweight tonnage in September 2013 . [ needs update ] Fully loaded , Nordic Orion sat too deep in the water to sail through the Panama Canal .",
