  "/wiki/Metre": "The metre ( Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling ) or meter ( American spelling ) ( from the French unit m\u00e8tre , from the Greek noun \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd , measure ) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units ( SI ) . The SI unit symbol is m. The metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second . The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle , so the Earth 's circumference is approximately 40,000 km . In 1799 , the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar ( the actual bar used was changed in 1889 ) . In 1960 , the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 . In 1983 , the current definition was adopted .",
  "/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)": "The foot ( pl . feet ; abbreviation : ft ; symbol : \u2032 , the prime symbol ) is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement . Since the International Yard and Pound Agreement of 1959 , one foot is defined as 0.3048 meter exactly . In customary and imperial units , the foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard . Historically the foot was a part of many local systems of units , including the Greek , Roman , Chinese , French , and English systems . It varied in length from country to country , from city to city , and sometimes from trade to trade . Its length was usually between 250 mm and 335 mm and was generally , but not always , subdivided into 12 inches or 16 digits . The United States is the only industrialized nation that uses the international foot and the survey foot ( a customary unit of length ) in preference to the meter in its commercial , engineering , and standards activities . The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom ; road signs must use imperial units ( however , distances on road signs are always marked in miles or yards , not feet ) , while its usage is widespread among the British public as a measurement of height . The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada officially defined as a unit derived from the meter although both the U.K. and Canada have partially metricated their units of measurement . The measurement of altitude in international aviation is one of the few areas where the foot is used outside the English-speaking world . The length of the international foot corresponds to a human foot with shoe size of 13 ( UK ) , 14 ( US male ) , 15.5 ( US female ) or 47 ( EU sizing ) .",

In addition to being one of the highest Brazilian mountains , Pedra da Mina is also remarkable for its peculiar history ( see below ) , as in spite of its high altitude and of being located relatively close to densely populated areas , until the turn of the 21st century the mountain was virtually unknown , so was its exact altitude , and its importance was not acknowledged until very recently , showing that even in the 21st century , geographical exploration may still hold surprises . In this case , official statistics and schoolbooks had to be corrected , and a new popular mountaineering and ecotourism destination appeared . Like all of Serra Fina , Pedra da Mina is composed of highly alkaline nepheline syenite , a type of rock that is easily eroded and for this reason is not usually found at very high altitudes . Pedra da Mina is believed to be the highest mountain made of that type of rock in the Americas and possibly in the world . Pedra means rock in Portuguese ; mina usually means mine , but it can also mean spring , water source . So , the name of the mountain means Water Spring Rock , and it is due to the fact that four small creeks rise from the mountain close to the top . Pedra da Mina is not located in any national or state park , but it is within the Mantiqueira Mountains Environmental Protection Area , and therefore still legally protected to some extent .",
