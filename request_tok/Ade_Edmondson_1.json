  "/wiki/The_Dangerous_Brothers": "The Dangerous Brothers was a stage and TV act by anarchic comedy duo Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson , performing respectively as Richard Dangerous and Sir Adrian Dangerous . Originally appearing on stage in London at the comedy club 'The Comic Strip ' , the characters were well developed before appearing on TV . First appearing on television on a one off 1980 BBC TV show 'Boom Boom Out Go The Lights ' , they were also featured in a TV short 'documentary ' film 'The Comic Strip ' , directed by Julien Temple , before they appeared in a number of brief sketches in the TV programme Saturday Live from 1985 on . The act was , in essence , a prototype of the career which the pair were to forge over the next twenty years in such shows as Mr Jolly Lives Next Door ; Filthy , Rich and Catflap ; and Bottom - two low-life loser perverts hitting each other in spectacular slapstick ways . It was arguably more hazardous than much of the material which was to follow in later incarnations - stage props in the brief run included a live ( and very large , although apparently lethargic ) crocodile , blank-firing submachine guns , and Edmondson apparently consuming Vim , a well-known UK brand of powder toilet cleaner . One of the early TV sketches 'World of Danger ' went wrong when a stunt to set fire to Edmondson 's trousers left him with serious burns - although much of this was left on the broadcast version . Sketch performed on 'BoomBoom Out Go The Lights '",

  "/wiki/The_Secret_Policeman's_Balls": "The Secret Policeman 's Ball is the name informally used for the long-running series of benefit shows staged initially in the United Kingdom to raise funds for the human rights organisation Amnesty International . The shows started in 1976 featuring popular British comedians but later included leading musicians and actors . The Secret Policeman 's Ball shows are credited by many prominent entertainers with having galvanised them to become involved with Amnesty and other social and political causes in succeeding years . Co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese , campaigner Peter Luff ( Assistant Director Amnesty International 1974-1978 ) , and entertainment industry executive Martin Lewis , there have been four distinct eras of the Amnesty benefit shows . The shows of the first era ( 1976-1981 ) , featuring five members of Monty Python and newcomers such as Rowan Atkinson , yielded films , television specials , home-videos , and albums that have since been widely seen and heard internationally . The three subsequent eras ( 1987-1989 , 1991-2001 and 2006 onwards ) have primarily featured locally popular British performers - and spin-off products have been released mainly in the UK . In March 2012 , The Secret Policeman 's Ball took place in the United States for the first time . The one-night show at New York 's Radio City Music Hall on 4 March was part of Amnesty 's 50th anniversary commemorations .",
