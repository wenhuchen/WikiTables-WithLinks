He served as the Roman governor of Liguria and Emilia , headquartered in Milan , before popular acclamation propelled him into becoming Bishop of Milan in 374 . Ambrose staunchly opposed Arianism . Western Christianity identified Ambrose as one of its four traditional Doctors of the Church , and as the patron saint of Milan . He had notable influence on Augustine of Hippo ( 354-430 ) . Tradition credits Ambrose with promoting antiphonal chant , a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other , as well as with composing Veni redemptor gentium , an Advent hymn .",

His intermittent episcopacy spanned 45 years ( c. 8 June 328 - 2 May 373 ) , of which over 17 encompassed five exiles , when he was replaced on the order of four different Roman emperors . Athanasius was a Christian theologian , a Church Father , the chief defender of Trinitarianism against Arianism , and a noted Egyptian leader of the fourth century . Conflict with Arius and Arianism as well as successive Roman emperors shaped Athanasius ' career . In 325 , at the age of 27 , Athanasius began his leading role against the Arians as a deacon and assistant to Bishop Alexander of Alexandria during the First Council of Nicaea . Roman emperor Constantine the Great had convened the council in May-August 325 to address the Arian position that the Son of God , Jesus of Nazareth , is of a distinct substance from the Father . Three years after that council , Athanasius succeeded his mentor as archbishop of Alexandria . In addition to the conflict with the Arians ( including powerful and influential Arian churchmen led by Eusebius of Nicomedia ) , he struggled against the Emperors Constantine , Constantius II , Julian the Apostate and Valens . He was known as Athanasius Contra Mundum ( Latin for Athanasius Against the World ) . Nonetheless , within a few years after his death , Gregory of Nazianzus called him the Pillar of the Church . His writings were well regarded by all following Church fathers in the West and the East , who noted their rich devotion to the Word-become-man , great pastoral concern and profound interest in monasticism . Athanasius is counted as one of the four great Eastern Doctors of the Church in the Catholic Church .",

With a population of 5,200,000 , Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean , the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa . The city extends about 40 km ( 25 mi ) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea . Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria . Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years , until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , when a new capital was founded at Fustat ( later absorbed into Cairo ) . Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity . It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome . The city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire . In the modern world , the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage .",

He was the bishop of Hippo Regius in North Africa and is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers of the Latin Church for his writings in the Patristic Period . Among his most important works are The City of God , De doctrina Christiana , and Confessions . According to his contemporary , Jerome , Augustine established anew the ancient Faith . [ a ] In his youth he was drawn to Manichaeism and later to neoplatonism . After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 386 , Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology , accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives . Believing that the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom , he helped formulate the doctrine of original sin and made seminal contributions to the development of just war theory . When the Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate , Augustine imagined the Church as a spiritual City of God , distinct from the material Earthly City . His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview . The segment of the Church that adhered to the concept of the Trinity as defined by the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Constantinople closely identified with Augustine 's On the Trinity . Augustine is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Churches , the Eastern Orthodox Church , and the Anglican Communion and as a preeminent Doctor of the Church .

  "/wiki/Carthage": "Carthage was the center or capital city of the ancient Carthaginian civilization , on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia . Carthage was widely considered the most important trading hub of the Ancient Mediterranean and was arguably one of the most affluent cities of the Ancient World . The city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC . The legendary Queen Alyssa or Dido is regarded as the founder of the city , though her historicity has been questioned . According to accounts by Timaeus of Tauromenium , she purchased from a local tribe the amount of land that could be covered by an oxhide . Cutting the skin into strips , she laid out her claim and founded an empire that would become , through the Punic Wars , the only existential threat to Rome until the coming of the Vandals several centuries later . The ancient city was destroyed by the Roman Republic in the Third Punic War in 146 BC and then re-developed as Roman Carthage , which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa . The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire . It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade . The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could n't be used as a base by a hostile power again . It also continued to function as an episcopal see . The regional power had shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period , until the early 20th century , when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis , incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919 .",

Most such works are sermons , since a large number of John 's actual sermons survive . Several works written by heretics were attributed to Chrysostom , which has ensured their survival . They are an important witness to the spirituality and mindset of certain heretical movements of the 4th and 5th centuries . Three Easter sermons of Pseudo-Chrysostom are thought to be by Apollinaris of Laodicea , the 4th-century opponent of Arianism who lapsed into the heresy that bears his name , Apollinarism . Two sermons for the octave of Easter have been identified as written by an Anomoean . These works are in Greek . The Opus imperfectum in Matthaeum , a series of sermons on the Gospel of Matthew , were written in Latin by an Arian bishop in the 5th or 6th century . The Pseudo-Chrysostom sermon on the glorious cross , In venerabilem crucem sermo , was widely copied in its original Greek and also translated into Armenian , Latin , Old Nubian , Old Russian ( East Slavic ) and Syriac . The Old Nubian text is the longest surviving text in that language . The Pseudo-Chrysostom sermon on the archangel Raphael , In Raphaelem archangelum , was also translated , revised and expanded in Arabic , Ge'ez ( Ethiopic ) and Old Nubian .

These microorganisms lack cell nuclei and are therefore prokaryotes . Archaea were initially classified as bacteria , receiving the name archaebacteria ( in the Archaebacteria kingdom ) , but this classification is outmoded . They have been renamed to clarify that archaea are not only not bacteria , but are more closely related to eukaryotes ( life whose cells can have a nucleus , including humans ) than to real bacteria . Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains , Bacteria and Eukaryota . Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla . Classification is difficult because most have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment . Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape , although a few archaea have very different shapes , such as the flat and square cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi . Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria , archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes , notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation . Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique , such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes , including archaeols . Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes : these range from organic compounds , such as sugars , to ammonia , metal ions or even hydrogen gas .

A member of the Flavian dynasty , Titus succeeded his father Vespasian upon his death , thus becoming the first Roman emperor to come to the throne after his own biological father . Before becoming emperor , Titus gained renown as a military commander , serving under his father in Judea during the First Jewish-Roman War . The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor Nero in 68 , launching Vespasian 's bid for the imperial power during the Year of the Four Emperors . When Vespasian was declared Emperor on 1 July 69 , Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion . In 70 , he besieged and captured Jerusalem , and destroyed the city and the Second Temple . For this achievement Titus was awarded a triumph ; the Arch of Titus commemorates his victory to this day .
