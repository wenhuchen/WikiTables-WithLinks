  "/wiki/8_Women": "8 Women ( French : 8 femmes ) is a 2002 French dark comedy musical film , written and directed by Fran\u00e7ois Ozon . Based on the 1958 play by Robert Thomas , it features an ensemble cast of high-profile French actresses that includes Danielle Darrieux , Catherine Deneuve , Isabelle Huppert , Emmanuelle B\u00e9art , Fanny Ardant , Virginie Ledoyen , Ludivine Sagnier , and Firmine Richard . Revolving around an eccentric family of women and their employees in the 1950s , the film follows eight women as they gather to celebrate Christmas in an isolated , snowbound cottage only to find Marcel , the family patriarch , dead with a knife in his back . Trapped in the house , every woman becomes a suspect , each having her own motive and secret . Ozon initially envisioned a remake of George Cukor 's film The Women ( 1939 ) , but eventually settled on Thomas 's Huit femmes after legal obstacles prevented him from doing so . Drawing inspiration from Cukor 's screwball comedies of the late 1930s and the 1950s work of directors such as Douglas Sirk , Vincente Minnelli , and Alfred Hitchcock , 8 Women blends farce , melodrama , musical , and murder-mystery film while addressing murder , greed , adultery , and homosexuality . Set primarily in the entry hall of a manor house , the film recreates much of the play 's original theatrical feel . It also serves as a pastiche of and homage to the history of film and the actresses ' filmographies . The film 's premiere was held on 8 January 2002 in Paris , where filming had taken place . 8 Women competed for the Golden Bear at the 52nd Berlin International Film Festival , where its all-female cast was awarded a Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution . Released to generally positive reviews , with major praise for the stars , the film was nominated for twelve C\u00e9sar Awards , including Best Film . At the 2002 European Film Awards , the film was nominated for six awards , including Best Film and Best Director ; it won for Best Actress for the eight principal actresses .",

  "/wiki/Irr\u00e9versible": "Irr\u00e9versible ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ i\u0281ev\u025b\u0281sibl ] ) is a 2002 French experimental psychological thriller drama film , written and directed by Gaspar No\u00e9 and starring Monica Bellucci , Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel . The film employs a reverse chronology and follows two men through the streets of Paris as they seek to avenge a brutally raped girlfriend . The film 's soundtrack was composed by Thomas Bangalter , one half of the electronic music duo Daft Punk . Irr\u00e9versible competed at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and won the Stockholm International Film Festival 's award for best film . Irr\u00e9versible has been associated with a series of films defined as the cin\u00e9ma du corps ( cinema of the body ) , which according to Palmer share affinities with certain avant-garde productions : an attenuated use of narrative , assaulting and often illegible cinematography , confrontational subject material , and a pervasive sense of social nihilism or despair . Irr\u00e9versible has also been associated with the New French Extremity movement . The film was particularly controversial upon its release for its graphic portrayal of violence , specifically the scene where a man is savagely bludgeoned to death with a fire extinguisher and its 10-minute long take rape of Alex ( Monica Bellucci ) , who is then brutally beaten into a coma . It had accusations of apparent homophobia as well . American film critic Roger Ebert called Irr\u00e9versible a movie so violent and cruel that most people will find it unwatchable .",
