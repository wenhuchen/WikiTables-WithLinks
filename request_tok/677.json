The Bloc was formed by Members of Parliament ( MPs ) who defected from the federal Progressive Conservative Party and Liberal Party during the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord . Founder Lucien Bouchard was a cabinet minister in the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney . The party seeks to create the conditions necessary for the political secession of Quebec from Canada and campaigns actively only within the province during federal elections . The party has been described as social democratic and separatist ( aka sovereigntist ) . The Bloc was the largest party in Quebec after Canadian federal elections , and either the second- or third-largest party in the House of Commons , for seven straight federal elections from the 1993 election until 2011 . The 2011 election saw the party win just four seats and lose official party status after a wave of support for the New Democratic Party . By 2014 , the party had been reduced to two seats because of resignations and expulsions . In the 2015 federal election , the Bloc won 10 seats in the House of Commons , even though the party 's leader Gilles Duceppe failed to win a seat . In the 2019 federal election , the party won 32 seats , regaining official party status as a result . The Bloc has strong informal ties to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ( PQ , whose members are known as P\u00e9quistes ) , a provincial party that advocates for the secession of Quebec from Canada and its independence , but the two are not linked organizationally . As with its provincial counterpart , the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has been supported by a wide range of voters in Quebec , from sections of organized labour to more conservative rural voters .",

The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada 's history , holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result , it is sometimes referred to as Canada 's natural governing party . The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice . In the 2015 federal election , the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election , winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats , gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons .

Reform was founded as a Western Canada-based protest movement and eventually became a populist conservative party , with strong social conservative elements . It was initially motivated by the perceived need for democratic reforms and by profound Western Canadian discontent with the Progressive Conservative ( PC ) federal government of Brian Mulroney . Led by its founder Preston Manning , Reform rapidly gained momentum in western Canada , and successfully supplanted the PCs as the largest party in Western Canada after the 1993 election . In opposition , the party advocated for spending restraint and democratic reform . In the leadup to the 1997 election , the party attempted to make a national breakthrough and replace the ailing PCs . However , a Liberal victory and disappointment with the lack of Eastern seats led many members to question the future direction of the party . The party was directly succeeded by the Canadian Alliance in 2000 , which merged with the Progressive Conservative Party in 2003 to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada .",
