  "/wiki/Brown_Trout": "The brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) is a European species of salmonid fish that has been widely introduced into suitable environments globally . It includes purely freshwater populations , referred to as the riverine ecotype , Salmo trutta morpha fario , a lacustrine ecotype , S. trutta morpha lacustris , also called the lake trout , and anadromous forms known as the sea trout , S. trutta morpha trutta . The latter migrates to the oceans for much of its life and returns to fresh water only to spawn . Sea trout in Ireland and Britain have many regional names : sewin in Wales , finnock in Scotland , peal in the West Country , mort in North West England , and white trout in Ireland . The lacustrine morph of brown trout is most usually potamodromous , migrating from lakes into rivers or streams to spawn , although evidence indicates some stocks spawn on wind-swept shorelines of lakes . S. trutta morpha fario forms stream-resident populations , typically in alpine streams , but sometimes in larger rivers . Anadromous and nonanadromous morphs coexisting in the same river appear genetically identical . What determines whether or not they migrate remains unknown .",
  "/wiki/M-37_(Michigan_highway)": "M-37 is a north-south state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan . The southern terminus is near the border between Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties at exit 92 of Interstate 94 ( I-94 ) southwest of Battle Creek . The northern terminus is at the Mission Point Light on Old Mission Point in Grand Traverse County . In between , the highway connects Battle Creek , Grand Rapids and Traverse City . Motorists will travel through agricultural land , forests , suburbs and large cities along the way . The section of M-37 on the Old Mission Peninsula was designated what is now a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway in 2008 . Originally named the Muskegon , Grand Traverse and Northport State Road , and later the Newaygo and Northport State Road , today 's modern highway can be traced back to the 19th century and earlier . The southernmost section between Grand Rapids and Battle Creek parallels an early Indian trail . The modern highway was formed by July 1 , 1919 along this segment . By the 1940s , a second section of highway was designated M-37 , creating a gap between it and the original section . This gap was eliminated in the 1950s , completing the M-37 corridor in the state . Additional changes to the routing were made through the Grand Rapids area into the 1970s .",

  "/wiki/Idlewild,_Michigan": "Idlewild is an unincorporated community in Yates Township , located just east of Baldwin in southeast Lake County , a rural part of northwestern lower Michigan . During the first half of the 20th century , it was one of the few resorts in the country where African-Americans were allowed to vacation and purchase property , before discrimination was outlawed in 1964 through the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . The surrounding area is within Manistee National Forest . The community encompasses Lake Idlewild , and the headwaters of the Pere Marquette River extends throughout the region . Called the Black Eden of Michigan , from 1912 through the mid-1960s , Idlewild was an active year-round community and was visited by well-known entertainers and professionals from throughout the country . At its peak , it was one of the most popular resorts in the Midwest and as many as 25,000 would come to Idlewild in the height of the summer season to enjoy camping , swimming , boating , fishing , hunting , horseback riding , roller skating , and night-time entertainment . When the 1964 Civil Rights Act opened up other resorts in many states to African-Americans , Idlewild 's boomtown period subsided . Though not quite a ghost town as claimed in the book Ghost Towns of Michigan , Chapter 7 , the population was under 1,000 in 2019 , and numerous buildings were vacant . The Idlewild African American Chamber of Commerce , founded in 2000 by John O. Meeks , continues to promote existing local businesses and seeking new ones . It is also striving to attract more visitors to the area , with events and other strategies , in hopes of resuscitating the once lively town .",

  "/wiki/Shrine_of_the_Pines": "Shrine of the Pines is a property south of Baldwin , Michigan on highway M-37 . It is significant for its collection of early 20th-century American craft furniture . Created by Raymond W. Overholzer over the course of nearly 30 years from the early 1920s until his death in 1952 , the collection was intended as a memorial to the eastern white pine which had been logged to near extinction in northern Michigan . The property , which includes the original log cabin built as a gallery space to house the furniture collection , along with the furniture was designated a Michigan State Historic Site on July 20 , 1982 . Overholzer , a native of Ohio , moved to the community of Marlborough , Michigan with his wife in 1920 during the era of extensive logging . An avid hunter and taxidermist , Overholzer regularly wandered what is now Manistee National Forest hunting game that he would later mount . Deeply concerned that the white pine had been ravaged throughout the area , he began collecting stumps and roots that remained from the logging activity , initially crafting them into mirror frames and bases for his taxidermy . By 1939 Overholzer 's collection of handcrafted items , made majoritively of found white pine pieces , had grown so large that he and three lumberman constructed a cabin as a gallery space . The cabin was given the name Shrine of the Pines , memorializing what had been Michigan 's greatest natural resource . The cabin was opened to the public , and Overholzer continued to work tirelessly , adding to the collection which numbered 201 pieces at the time of his death . The collection includes a dining table and seating for ten , a buffet and a side tables , beds for guests , a game table with five club chairs , rocking chair with an accompanying ottoman , a pair of fireplace chairs , a revolving gun rack , etc .
