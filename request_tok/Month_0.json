  "/wiki/January": "January is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days . The first day of the month is known as New Year 's Day . It is , on average , the coldest month of the year within most of the Northern Hemisphere ( where it is the second month of winter ) and the warmest month of the year within most of the Southern Hemisphere ( where it is the second month of summer ) . In the Southern hemisphere , January is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa . Ancient Roman observances during this month include Cervula and Juvenalia , celebrated January 1 , as well as one of three Agonalia , celebrated January 9 , and Carmentalia , celebrated January 11 . These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar",
  "/wiki/Day": "A day is approximately the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis . A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times . Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods , that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol . In 1960 , the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900 , and was designated the SI base unit of time . The unit of measurement day , was redefined as 86,400 SI seconds and symbolized d. In 1967 , the second and so the day were redefined by atomic electron transition . A civil day is usually 86,400 seconds , plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) , and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time . Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods , reckoned from one midnight to the next , into which a week , month , or year is divided , and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis . However , its use depends on its context ; for example , when people say 'day and night ' , 'day ' will have a different meaning : the interval of light between two successive nights , the time between sunrise and sunset ; the time of light between one night and the next . For clarity when meaning 'day ' in that sense , the word daytime may be used instead , though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear . The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date , as in answer to the question , On which day ? The life patterns ( circadian rhythms ) of humans and many other species are related to Earth 's solar day and the day-night cycle .",
  "/wiki/February": "February is the second month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars , with 28 days in common years and 29 days in leap years , with the quadrennial 29th day being called the leap day . It is the first of five months to have fewer than 31 days ( the other four being April , June , September , and November ) and the only one to have fewer than 30 days . The other seven months have 31 days . In 2020 , February has 29 days . February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere . In the Southern Hemisphere , February is the third and last month of summer ( being the seasonal equivalent of what is August in the Northern Hemisphere ) .",
  "/wiki/Leap_year": "A leap year ( also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year ) is a calendar year that contains an additional day ( or , in the case of a lunisolar calendar , a month ) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year . Because astronomical events and seasons do not repeat in a whole number of days , calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track . By inserting ( called intercalating in technical terminology ) an additional day or month into the year , the drift can be corrected . A year that is not a leap year is a common year . For example , in the Gregorian calendar , each leap year has 366 days instead of 365 , by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28 . These extra days occur in each year which is an integer multiple of 4 ( except for years evenly divisible by 100 , which are not leap years unless evenly divisible by 400 ) . Similarly , in the lunisolar Hebrew calendar , Adar Aleph , a 13th lunar month , is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons . In the Bah\u00e1 ' \u00ed Calendar , a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the March equinox . The term leap year probably comes from the fact that a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next , but the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day ( from March 1 through February 28 of the following year ) will advance two days due to the extra day , thus leaping over one day in the week . For example , Christmas Day ( December 25 ) fell on a Tuesday in 2012 , Wednesday in 2013 , Thursday in 2014 , and Friday in 2015 , but then leapt over Saturday to fall on a Sunday in 2016 . The length of a day is also occasionally corrected by inserting a leap second into Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) because of variations in Earth 's rotational period . Unlike leap days , leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule because variations in the length of the day are not entirely predictable .",
  "/wiki/March": "March is the third month of the year and named after Mars in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars . It is the second of seven months to have a length of 31 days . In the Northern Hemisphere , the meteorological beginning of spring occurs on the first day of March . The March equinox on the 20 or 21 marks the astronomical beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere , where September is the seasonal equivalent of the Northern Hemisphere 's March .",
  "/wiki/April": "April is the fourth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar , the fifth in the early Julian , the first of four months to have a length of 30 days , and the second of five months to have a length of less than 31 days . April is commonly associated with the season of autumn in parts of the Southern Hemisphere , and spring in parts of the Northern Hemisphere , where it is the seasonal equivalent to October in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa .",
  "/wiki/May": "May is the fifth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the third of seven months to have a length of 31 days . May is a month of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere . Therefore , May in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of November in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa . Late May typically marks the start of the summer vacation season in the United States and Canada that ends on Labor Day , the first Monday of September . May ( in Latin , Maius ) was named for the Greek Goddess Maia , who was identified with the Roman era goddess of fertility , Bona Dea , whose festival was held in May . Conversely , the Roman poet Ovid provides a second etymology , in which he says that the month of May is named for the maiores , Latin for elders , and that the following month ( June ) is named for the iuniores , or young people ( Fasti VI.88 ) .",
  "/wiki/June": "June is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars , the second of four months to have a length of 30 days , and the third of five months to have a length of less than 31 days . June contains the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere , the day with the most daylight hours , and the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere , the day with the fewest daylight hours ( excluding polar regions in both cases ) . June in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to December in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa . In the Northern Hemisphere , the beginning of the traditional astronomical summer is 21 June ( meteorological summer begins on 1 June ) . In the Southern Hemisphere , meteorological winter begins on 1 June . At the start of June , the sun rises in the constellation of Taurus ; at the end of June , the sun rises in the constellation of Gemini . However , due to the precession of the equinoxes , June begins with the sun in the astrological sign of Gemini , and ends with the sun in the astrological sign of Cancer . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/July": "July is the seventh month of the year ( between June and August ) in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and the fourth of seven months to have a length of 31 days . It was named by the Roman Senate in honour of Roman general Julius Caesar , it being the month of his birth . Prior to that , it was called Quintilis , being the fifth month of the 10-month calendar . It is on average the warmest month in most of the Northern Hemisphere , where it is the second month of summer , and the coldest month in much of the Southern Hemisphere , where it is the second month of winter . The second half of the year commences in July . In the Southern Hemisphere , July is the seasonal equivalent of January in the Northern hemisphere . Dog days are considered to begin in early July in the Northern Hemisphere , when the hot sultry weather of summer usually starts . Spring lambs born in late winter or early spring are usually sold before 1 July . July is the traditional period known as fence month , the closed season for deer in England . The end of England 's High Court of Justice Trinity Term takes place on 31 July . July is also the time in which the elections take place for the Japanese House of Councillors , held every three years and replacing half of its seats . In Ancient Rome , the festival of Poplifugia was celebrated on 5 July , and Ludi Apollinares was held on 13 July and for several days afterwards .",
  "/wiki/August": "August is the eighth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars , and the fifth of seven months to have a length of 31 days . It was originally named Sextilis in Latin because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month Roman calendar under Romulus in 753 BC , with March being the first month of the year . About 700 BC , it became the eighth month when January and February were added to the year before March by King Numa Pompilius , who also gave it 29 days . Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 46 BC ( 708 AUC ) , giving it its modern length of 31 days . In 8 BC , it was renamed in honor of Augustus . According to a Senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius , he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs , including the conquest of Egypt . In the Southern Hemisphere , August is the seasonal equivalent of February in the Northern Hemisphere . In many European countries , August is the holiday month for most workers . Numerous religious holidays occurred during August in ancient Rome . Certain meteor showers take place in August . The Kappa Cygnids take place in August , with the dates varying each year . The Alpha Capricornids meteor shower takes place as early as July 10 and ends at around August 10 , and the Southern Delta Aquariids take place from mid-July to mid-August , with the peak usually around July 28-29 .",
  "/wiki/September": "September is the ninth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars , the third of four months to have a length of 30 days , and the fourth of five months to have a length of less than 31 days . In the Northern Hemisphere September is the seasonal equivalent of March in the Southern Hemisphere . In the Northern hemisphere , the beginning of the meteorological autumn is on 1 September . In the Southern hemisphere , the beginning of the meteorological spring is on 1 September . September marks the beginning of the ecclesiastical year in the Eastern Orthodox Church . It is the start of the academic year in many countries of the northern hemisphere , in which children go back to school after the summer break , sometimes on the first day of the month . September ( from Latin septem , seven ) was originally the seventh of ten months in the oldest known Roman calendar , the calendar of Romulus c. 750 BC , with March ( Latin Martius ) the first month of the year until perhaps as late as 451 BC . After the calendar reform that added January and February to the beginning of the year , September became the ninth month , but retained its name . It had 29 days until the Julian reform , which added a day . Ancient Roman observances for September include Ludi Romani , originally celebrated from September 12 to September 14 , later extended to September 5 to September 19 . In the 1st century BC , an extra day was added in honor of the deified Julius Caesar on 4 September . Epulum Jovis was held on September 13 .",
  "/wiki/October": "October is the tenth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and the sixth of seven months to have a length of 31 days . The eighth month in the old calendar of Romulus c. 750 BC , October retained its name ( from the Latin and Greek \u00f4ct\u014d meaning eight ) after January and February were inserted into the calendar that had originally been created by the Romans . In Ancient Rome , one of three Mundus patet would take place on October 5 , Meditrinalia October 11 , Augustalia on October 12 , October Horse on October 15 , and Armilustrium on October 19 . These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar . Among the Anglo-Saxons , it was known as \u01f7interfylle\u00fe , because at this full moon ( fylle\u00fe ) winter was supposed to begin . October is commonly associated with the season of autumn in the Northern hemisphere and with spring in the Southern hemisphere .",

November is a month of late spring in the Southern Hemisphere and late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere . Therefore , November in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa .
