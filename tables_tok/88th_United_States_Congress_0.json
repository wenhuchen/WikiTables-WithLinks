  "intro": "The Eighty-eighth United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from January 3, 1963, to January 3, 1965, during the last year of the administration of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and the first of the administration of his successor, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the Eighteenth Census of the United States in 1960, and the number of members was again 435 (had temporarily been 437 in order to seat one member each from recently admitted states of Alaska and Hawaii). Both chambers had a Democratic majority."
