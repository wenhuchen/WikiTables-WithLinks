  "/wiki/Jumpers": "Jumpers is a play by Tom Stoppard which was first performed in 1972 . It explores and satirises the field of academic philosophy , likening it to a less-than skilful competitive gymnastics display . Jumpers raises questions such as What do we know ? and Where do values come from ? It is set in an alternative reality where some British astronauts have landed on the moon and Radical Liberals ( read pragmatists and relativists ) have taken over the British government ( the play seems to suggest that pragmatists and relativists would be immoral : Archie says that murder is not wrong , merely antisocial ) . It was inspired by the notion that a manned moon landing would ruin the moon as a poetic trope and possibly lead to a collapse of moral values . It is often listed among Stoppards strongest plays .",

Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",

  "/wiki/Edward_II_(play)": "The Troublesome Reign and Lamentable Death of Edward the Second , King of England , with the Tragical Fall of Proud Mortimer , known as Edward II , is a Renaissance or Early Modern period play written by Christopher Marlowe . It is one of the earliest English history plays , and focusses on the relationship between King Edward II of England and Piers Gaveston , and Edward 's murder on the orders of Roger Mortimer . Marlowe found most of his material for this play in the third volume of Raphael Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) . Frederick S. Boas believes that out of all the rich material provided by Holinshed Marlowe was drawn to the comparatively unattractive reign of Edward II due to the relationship between the King and Gaveston . Boas elaborates , Homosexual affection . has ( as has been seen ) a special attraction for Marlowe . Jove and Ganymede in Dido , Henry III and his 'minions ' in The Massacre , Neptune and Leander in Hero and Leander , and all akin , although drawn to a slighter scale , to Edward and Gaveston . Boas also notes the existence of a number of parallels between Edward II and The Massacre at Paris , asserting that it is scarcely too much to say that scenes xi-xxi of The Massacre are something in the nature of a preliminary sketch for Edward II . Marlowe stayed close to the account but embellished it with the character of Lightborn ( or Lucifer ) as Edward 's assassin .",

Marlowe was the foremost Elizabethan tragedian of his day . He greatly influenced William Shakespeare , who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe 's mysterious early death . Marlowe 's plays are known for the use of blank verse and their overreaching protagonists . Some scholars believe that a warrant was issued for Marlowe 's arrest on 18 May 1593 . No reason was given for it , though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy - a manuscript believed to have been written by Marlowe was said to contain vile heretical conceipts . On 20 May , he was brought to the court to attend upon the Privy Council for questioning . There is no record of their having met that day , and his being commanded to attend upon them each day thereafter , until licensed to the contrary . Ten days later , he was stabbed to death by Ingram Frizer . Whether or not the stabbing was connected to his arrest remains unknown .",
  "/wiki/The_Country_Wife": "The Country Wife is a Restoration comedy written in 1675 by William Wycherley . A product of the tolerant early Restoration period , the play reflects an aristocratic and anti-Puritan ideology , and was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time . The title itself contains a lewd pun with regard to the first syllable of country . It is based on several plays by Moli\u00e8re , with added features that 1670s London audiences demanded : colloquial prose dialogue in place of Moli\u00e8re 's verse , a complicated , fast-paced plot tangle , and many sex jokes . It turns on two indelicate plot devices : a rake 's trick of pretending near impotence to safely have clandestine affairs with married women , and the arrival in London of an inexperienced young country wife , with her discovery of the joys of town life , especially the fascinating London men . The implied condition the Rake , Horner , claimed to suffer from was , he said , contracted in France whilst dealing with common women . The only cure was to have a surgeon drastically reduce the extent of his manly stature and therefore he would be no threat to any man 's wife . The scandalous trick and the frank language have for much of the play 's history kept it off the stage and out of print . Between 1753 and 1924 , The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick 's cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl , now a forgotten curiosity . The original play is again a stage favourite today , and is also acclaimed by academic critics , who praise its linguistic energy , sharp social satire , and openness to different interpretations .",

  "/wiki/The_Tempest": "The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare , probably written in 1610-1611 , and thought to be one of the last plays that Shakespeare wrote alone . After the first scene , which takes place on a ship at sea during a tempest , the rest of the story is set on a remote island , where the sorcerer Prospero , a complex and contradictory character , lives with his daughter Miranda , and his two servants - Caliban , a savage monster figure , and Ariel , an airy spirit . The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island . It explores many themes , including magic , betrayal , revenge , and family . In Act IV , a wedding masque serves as a play-within-the play , and contributes spectacle , allegory , and elevated language . Though The Tempest is listed in the First Folio as the first of Shakespeare 's comedies , it deals with both tragic and comic themes , and modern criticism has created a category of romance for this and others of Shakespeare 's late plays . The Tempest has been put to varied interpretations - from those that see it as a fable of art and creation , with Prospero representing Shakespeare , and Prospero 's renunciation of magic signaling Shakespeare 's farewell to the stage , to interpretations that consider it an allegory of Europeans colonizing foreign lands .",

Originally published in the First Folio of 1623 , where it was listed as a comedy , the play 's first recorded performance occurred in 1604 . The play 's main themes include justice , morality and mercy in Vienna , and the dichotomy between corruption and purity : some rise by sin , and some by virtue fall . Mercy and virtue prevail , as the play does not end tragically , with virtues such as compassion and forgiveness being exercised at the end of the production . While the play focuses on justice overall , the final scene illustrates that Shakespeare intended for moral justice to temper strict civil justice : a number of the characters receive understanding and leniency , instead of the harsh punishment to which they , according to the law , could have been sentenced . Measure for Measure is often called one of Shakespeare 's problem plays . It continues to be classified as a comedy , albeit a dark one , though its tone may defy those expectations .",

  "/wiki/Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane": "The Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , commonly known as Drury Lane , is a West End theatre and Grade I listed building in Covent Garden , London , England . The building faces Catherine Street ( earlier named Bridges or Brydges Street ) and backs onto Drury Lane . The building is the most recent in a line of four theatres which were built at the same location , the earliest of which dated back to 1663 , making it the oldest theatre site in London still in use . According to the author Peter Thomson , for its first two centuries , Drury Lane could reasonably have claimed to be London 's leading theatre . For most of that time , it was one of a handful of patent theatres , granted monopoly rights to the production of legitimate drama in London ( meaning spoken plays , rather than opera , dance , concerts , or plays with music ) . The first theatre on the site was built at the behest of Thomas Killigrew in the early 1660s , when theatres were allowed to reopen during the English Restoration . Initially known as Theatre Royal in Bridges Street , the theatre 's proprietors hired prominent actors who performed at the theatre on a regular basis , including Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart . In 1672 , the theatre caught fire and Killigrew built a larger theatre on the same plot , renamed the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane ; it opened in 1674 . This building lasted nearly 120 years , under the leaderships of Colley Cibber , David Garrick and Richard Brinsley Sheridan , the last of whom employed Joseph Grimaldi as the theatre 's resident Clown . In 1791 , under Sheridan 's management , the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794 . This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809 . The building that stands today opened in 1812 .",
  "/wiki/King_Lear": "King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare . It tells the tale of a king who bequeaths his power and land to two of his three daughters , after they declare their love for him in an extremely fawning and obsequious manner . His third daughter gets nothing , because she will not flatter him as her sisters had done . When he feels disrespected by the two daughters who now have his wealth and power , he becomes furious to the point of madness . He eventually becomes tenderly reconciled to his third daughter , just before tragedy strikes her and then the king . Derived from the legend of Leir of Britain , a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king , the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures , with the title role coveted by many of the world 's most accomplished actors . The first attribution to Shakespeare of this play , originally drafted in 1605 or 1606 at the latest with its first known performance on St. Stephen 's Day in 1606 , was a 1608 publication in a quarto of uncertain provenance , in which the play is listed as a history ; it may be an early draft or simply reflect the first performance text . The Tragedy of King Lear , a revised version that is better tailored for performance , was included in the 1623 First Folio . Modern editors usually conflate the two , though some insist that each version has its own individual integrity that should be preserved . After the English Restoration , the play was often revised with a happy ending for audiences who disliked its dark and depressing tone , but since the 19th century Shakespeare 's original version has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements . The tragedy is noted for its probing observations on the nature of human suffering and kinship . George Bernard Shaw wrote No man will ever write a better tragedy than Lear .",

  "/wiki/Carousel_(musical)": "Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers ( music ) and Oscar Hammerstein II ( book and lyrics ) . The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Moln\u00e1r 's 1909 play Liliom , transplanting its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline . The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow , whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs . He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child ; after it goes tragically wrong , he is given a chance to make things right . A secondary plot line deals with millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow . The show includes the well-known songs If I Loved You , June Is Bustin ' Out All Over and You 'll Never Walk Alone . Richard Rodgers later wrote that Carousel was his favorite of all his musicals . Following the spectacular success of the first Rodgers and Hammerstein musical , Oklahoma ! ( 1943 ) , the pair sought to collaborate on another piece , knowing that any resulting work would be compared with Oklahoma ! , most likely unfavorably . They were initially reluctant to seek the rights to Liliom ; Moln\u00e1r had refused permission for the work to be adapted in the past , and the original ending was considered too depressing for the musical theatre . After acquiring the rights , the team created a work with lengthy sequences of music and made the ending more hopeful . The musical required considerable modification during out-of-town tryouts , but once it opened on Broadway on April 19 , 1945 , it was an immediate hit with both critics and audiences .",

  "/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest": "The Importance of Being Earnest , A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde . First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James 's Theatre in London , it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations . Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London , the play 's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage , and the resulting satire of Victorian ways . Some contemporary reviews praised the play 's humour and the culmination of Wilde 's artistic career , while others were cautious about its lack of social messages . Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde 's most enduringly popular play . The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde 's career but also heralded his downfall . The Marquess of Queensberry , whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde 's lover , planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show . Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission . Their feud came to a climax in court , where Wilde 's homosexuality was revealed to the Victorian public and he was sentenced to imprisonment . Despite the play 's early success , Wilde 's notoriety caused the play to be closed after 86 performances . After his release from prison , he published the play from exile in Paris , but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work . The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere .",
  "/wiki/Oscar_Wilde": "Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde ( 16 October 1854 - 30 November 1900 ) was an Irish poet and playwright . After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s , the early 1890s saw him become one of the most popular playwrights in London . He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays , his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray , and the circumstances of his criminal conviction for gross indecency , imprisonment , and early death at age 46 . Wilde 's parents were successful Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin . A young Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German . At university , Wilde read Greats ; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional classicist , first at Trinity College Dublin , then at Oxford . He became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism , led by two of his tutors , Walter Pater and John Ruskin . After university , Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles . As a spokesman for aestheticism , he tried his hand at various literary activities : he published a book of poems , lectured in the United States and Canada on the new English Renaissance in Art and interior decoration , and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist . Known for his biting wit , flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill , Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day . At the turn of the 1890s , he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays , and incorporated themes of decadence , duplicity , and beauty into what would be his only novel , The Picture of Dorian Gray ( 1890 ) . The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely , and combine them with larger social themes , drew Wilde to write drama .",
