  "/wiki/Country": "The term country refers to a political state or nation or its territory . It is often referred to as the land of an individual 's birth , residence , or citizenship . A country may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state , as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division , a physical territory with a government , or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics . It is not inherently sovereign . Countries can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities , while other times it can refer only to states . For example , the CIA World Factbook uses the word in its Country name field to refer to a wide variety of dependencies , areas of special sovereignty , uninhabited islands , and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states . [ Note 1 ] The largest country in the world is Russia , while the most populated is China . The newest country is South Sudan .",
  "/wiki/Track_gauge": "In rail transport , track gauge or track gage is the spacing of the rails on a railway track and is measured between the inner faces of the load-bearing rails . All vehicles on a rail network must have running gear that is compatible with the track gauge , and in the earliest days of railways the selection of a proposed railway 's gauge was a key issue . As the dominant parameter determining interoperability , it is still frequently used as a descriptor of a route or network . In some places there is a distinction between the nominal gauge and the actual gauge , due to divergence of track components from the nominal . Railway engineers use a device , like a caliper , to measure the actual gauge , and this device is also referred to as a track gauge . The terms structure gauge and loading gauge , both widely used , have little connection with track gauge . Both refer to two-dimensional cross-section profiles , surrounding the track and vehicles running on it . The structure gauge specifies the outline into which new or altered structures ( bridges , lineside equipment etc . ) must not encroach . The loading gauge is the corresponding envelope within which rail vehicles and their loads must be contained . If an exceptional load or a new type of vehicle is being assessed to run , it is required to conform to the route 's loading gauge . Conformance ensures that traffic will not collide with lineside structures .",
  "/wiki/Voltage": "Voltage , electric potential difference , electric pressure or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points . The difference in electric potential between two points ( i.e. , voltage ) in a static electric field is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points . In the International System of Units , the derived unit for voltage is named volt . In SI units , work per unit charge is expressed as joules per coulomb , where 1 volt = 1 joule ( of work ) per 1 coulomb ( of charge ) . The official SI definition for volt uses power and current , where 1 volt = 1 watt ( of power ) per 1 ampere ( of current ) . This definition is equivalent to the more commonly used 'joules per coulomb ' . Voltage or electric potential difference is denoted symbolically by \u2206V , but more often simply as V , for instance in the context of Ohm 's or Kirchhoff 's circuit laws . Electric potential differences between points can be caused by electric charge , by electric current through a magnetic field , by time-varying magnetic fields , or some combination of these three . A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage ( or potential difference ) between two points in a system ; often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points . A voltage may represent either a source of energy ( electromotive force ) or lost , used , or stored energy ( potential drop ) .",

The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects .

Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne .
