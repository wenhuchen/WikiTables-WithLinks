A few decades later , a new Tory party would rise to establish a hold on government between 1783 and 1830 , with William Pitt the Younger followed by Robert Jenkinson , 2nd Earl of Liverpool . The Earl of Liverpool was succeeded by fellow Tory Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington , whose term included the Catholic Emancipation , which occurred mostly due to the election of Daniel O'Connell as a Catholic MP from Ireland . When the Whigs subsequently regained control , the Representation of the People Act 1832 removed the rotten boroughs , many of which were controlled by Tories . In the following general election , the Tory ranks were reduced to 180 MPs . Under the leadership of Robert Peel , the Tamworth Manifesto was issued , which began to transform the Tories into the Conservative Party . However , Peel lost many of his supporters by repealing the Corn Laws , causing the party to break apart .
