He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon ( second only to Bugs himself ) . His aim is to hunt Bugs , but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters . He speaks in an unusual way , replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws , so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a scwewy wabbit . Elmer 's signature catchphrase is , Shhh . Be vewy vewy quiet , I 'm hunting wabbits , as well as his trademark laughter . The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones ' work What 's Opera , Doc ? ( one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs , though he felt bad about it ) , the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville , and the Hunting Trilogy of Rabbit Season/Duck Season shorts ( Rabbit Fire , Rabbit Seasoning , and Duck !

As with its sister series , Looney Tunes , it featured cartoon characters such as Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd .

After Bugs Bunny became the breakout recurring star of Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes went to color in the early 1940s , the two series gradually lost their distinctions and shorts were assigned to each series more randomly . Merrie Melodies was originally produced by Harman-Ising Pictures from 1931 to 1933 , and then Leon Schlesinger Productions from 1933 to 1944 . Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. in 1944 , and the newly renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons continued production until 1963 . It was outsourced to DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and Format Productions from 1964 to 1967 , and Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Animation resumed production for its final two years . Three of the Merrie Melodies films ( Tweetie Pie , Speedy Gonzales and Birds Anonymous ) won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film and another three ( Duck Amuck , One Froggy Evening and What 's Opera , Doc ? ) have been inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress . In 2013 , TV Guide ranked the Warner Bros.

This personality change , which was previously explored by Jones in You Were Never Duckier and Daffy Dilly , and even earlier in Friz Freleng 's You Ought to Be in Pictures , was done in order for Daffy to better serve as Bugs ' foil . This was fueled by Bugs ' popularity surpassing Daffy 's quickly over the years , increasing the desire of the studio 's animators to pair the two together .
