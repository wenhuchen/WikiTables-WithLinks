  "/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase": "The Louisiana Purchase ( French : Vente de la Louisiane 'Sale of Louisiana ' ) was the acquisition of the territory of Louisiana by the United States from France in 1803 . In return for fifteen million dollars , or approximately eighteen dollars per square mile , the United States nominally acquired a total of 828,000 sq mi ( 2,140,000 km2 ; 530,000,000 acres ) . However , France only controlled a small fraction of this area , with most of it inhabited by Native Americans ; for the majority of the area , what the United States bought was the preemptive right to obtain Native American lands by treaty or by conquest , to the exclusion of other colonial powers . The total cost of all subsequent treaties and financial settlements over the land has been estimated to be around 2.6 billion dollars . The Kingdom of France had controlled the Louisiana territory from 1699 until it was ceded to Spain in 1762 . In 1800 , Napoleon , then the First Consul of the French Republic , regained ownership of Louisiana as part of a broader project to re-establish a French colonial empire in North America . However , France 's failure to put down a revolt in Saint-Domingue , coupled with the prospect of renewed warfare with the United Kingdom , prompted Napoleon to consider selling Louisiana to the United States . Acquisition of Louisiana was a long-term goal of President Thomas Jefferson , who was especially eager to gain control of the crucial Mississippi River port of New Orleans . Jefferson tasked James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston with purchasing New Orleans . Negotiating with French Treasury Minister Fran\u00e7ois Barb\u00e9-Marbois ( who was acting on behalf of Napoleon ) , the American representatives quickly agreed to purchase the entire territory of Louisiana after it was offered . Overcoming the opposition of the Federalist Party , Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison convinced Congress to ratify and fund the Louisiana Purchase .
