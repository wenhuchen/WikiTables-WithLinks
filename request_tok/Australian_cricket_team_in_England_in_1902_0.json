  "/wiki/Joe_Darling": "Joseph Darling CBE ( 21 November 1870 - 2 January 1946 ) was an Australian cricketer who played 34 Test matches as a specialist batsman between 1894 and 1905 . As captain , he led Australia in a total of 21 Tests , winning seven and losing four . In Test cricket , he scored 1657 runs at an average of 28.56 per innings , including three centuries . Darling toured England four times with the Australian team - in 1896 , 1899 , 1902 and 1905 ; the last three tours as captain . He was captain of the Australian cricket team in England in 1902 , widely recognised as one of the best teams in Australian cricket history . He was a stocky , compact man and a strong driver of the ball , playing most of his cricket as an opening batsman . He was a patient batsman and was known for his solid defence , but he was able to score quickly when required . In Sydney in 1897-98 , he scored 160 in 165 minutes , including 30 boundaries to assist his team in defeating the English . He was the first man to score 500 runs in a Test series and was also the first to score three centuries in a series . His captaincy was disciplinarian in nature but his teammates respected his broad cricket knowledge . Even tempered with a strong personality , he was a stickler for fair play on the field . His teammates gave him the nickname Paddy due to a supposed resemblance to the Australian boxer , Frank Paddy Slavin .",
  "/wiki/Captain_(cricket)": "The captain of a cricket team , often referred to as the skipper , is the appointed leader , having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players . As in other sports , the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills , and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team , as the captain often has a say in team selection . Before the game the captains toss for innings . During the match the captain decides the team 's batting order , who will bowl each over , and where each fielder will be positioned . While the captain has the final say , decisions are often collaborative . A captain 's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics , and shrewdness in the field , may contribute significantly to the team 's success . Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff , as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making , the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports .",

  "/wiki/Leg_break": "A leg break is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket . It is a delivery of a right-handed leg spin bowler . A leg break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers . As the ball is released , the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball flicked by the ring finger , giving the ball an anti-clockwise spin as seen from behind . When the ball bounces on the pitch , the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler 's perspective ; this is to the right from the batsman 's point of view , or towards the off side of a right-handed batsman . The ball spins away from the leg side , and this is where it gets the name leg break , meaning it breaks away from the leg . The turn is mostly when the ball pitches . A leg spin bowler will bowl mostly leg breaks , varying them by adjusting the line and length , and amount of side spin versus topspin of the deliveries . Leg breaks are considered to be one of the more difficult spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play because the ball moves away from their body . This means that any miscalculation can result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders . Alternatively , for a ball aimed outside the leg stump , the breaking may be so sharp that the ball goes behind a right-handed batsman and hits the stumps - the batsman is then said ( informally ) to be bowled around his legs . The animation on this page illustrates such a delivery .",
  "/wiki/Fast_bowling": "Pace bowler ( also referred to as fast bowling ) is one of two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket , the other being spin bowling . Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as fast bowlers , quicks , or pacemen . They can also be referred to as a seam bowler , a swing bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it ' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries . Strictly speaking , a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace , though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days . The aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake . The bowler achieves this by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable , linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it . For deviation caused by the ball 's stitching ( the seam ) , the ball bounces off the pitch and deflects either away from the batsman 's body , or inwards towards them . Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way . To 'bowl swing ' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air . Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation , body position at the point of release , asymmetric ball polishing , and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball . The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement ' can make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately . Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory , the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly , or at all .",

  "/wiki/Off_break": "An off break is the type of delivery in the sport of cricket . It is the attacking delivery of an off spin bowler . Off breaks are known as off spinners . An off break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers .

Off breaks are considered to be one of the easier spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play . This is because the ball moves in towards the batsman 's body , meaning the batsman 's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge . This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from an off break , but it does mean there is a chance of leg before wicket , assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump .

Left arm orthodox spin bowlers generally attempt to drift the ball in the air into a right-handed batsman , and then turn it away from the batsman ( towards off-stump ) upon landing on the pitch . The drift and turn in the air are attacking techniques . The stock delivery of a left-arm orthodox spin bowler is the left-arm orthodox spinner . The major variations of a left-arm orthodox spin bowler are the topspinner ( which turns less and bounces higher in the cricket pitch ) , the arm ball ( which does not turn at all , drifts into a right-handed batsman in the direction of the bowler 's arm movement ; also called a 'floater ' ) and the left-arm spinner 's version of a doosra ( which turns the other way ) .",

A tall and thin off spinner , Trumble delivered the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers , using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage .
