[ m\u0259l\u0259ja\u02d0\u026d\u0259m ] ) is a Dravidian language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala and the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry ( Mah\u00e9 district ) by the Malayali people . It is one of 22 scheduled languages of India spoken by nearly 2.88% of Indians . Malayalam has official language status in the state of Kerala and in the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry ( Mah\u00e9 ) and is spoken by 37 million people worldwide . Malayalam is also spoken by linguistic minorities in the neighbouring states ; with significant number of speakers in the Nilgiris , Kanyakumari , and Coimbatore districts of Tamil Nadu , and Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka . Due to Malayali expatriates in the Persian Gulf , the language is also widely spoken in Gulf countries . The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars . One view holds that Malayalam and modern Tamil are offshoots of Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after the c. 7th century AD . A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of Proto-Dravidian or Proto-Tamil-Malayalam in the prehistoric era . Designated a Classical Language in India in 2013 , it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan in the 16th century . The oldest documents written purely in Malayalam and still surviving are the Vazhappalli Copper plates from 832 AD and Tharisapalli Copper plates from 849 AD . The earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu alphabet , and later the Kolezhuttu , which derived from it .",

English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",

The thirty-three-minute documentary features the life and some of the works by Balasaraswati in the form of narration and dance , starring herself . At the age of fourteen , Ray had seen a performance of Balasaraswati in Kolkata , then known as Calcutta , in 1935 , when she was seventeen years old .

Incidentally , though Bala was often called a revolutionary Bharatanatyam dancer , she had never been filmed till she was 58 years old , in spite of having a career spanned over four decades .

Urdu is the official national language , and lingua franca , of Pakistan . In India , it is one of 22 constitutionally recognised official languages , having official status in the five states of Telangana , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , as well as the national capital territory of Delhi . As both registers are composed of the same Indo-Aryan vocabulary base , colloquial Urdu is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi , with the two registers being grouped together as Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu . With respect to literary vocabulary , however , formal Urdu draws heavily from Persian vocabulary and requires knowledge of some simple Persian grammatical structures , while formal Hindi heavily draws from Sanskrit for its formal and technical vocabulary . Later , Urdu became the official language of government in northern and northwest British India , along with English , from 1837 onwards in place of Persian , which had been used by various Indo-Islamic empires as their language of government . Religious , social , and political factors arose during the colonial period that advocated for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi , leading to the Hindi-Urdu controversy . According to Nationalencyklopedin 's 2010 estimates , Urdu is the 21st most spoken first language in the world , with approximately 66 million who speak it as their native language . According to Ethnologue 's 2018 estimates , Urdu , is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world , with 170 million total speakers , including those who speak it as a second language . If grouped along with Hindi , Hindustani would be the 3rd most spoken language in the world , with approximately 329.1 million native speakers , and 697.4 million total speakers of both Urdu and Hindi .",
