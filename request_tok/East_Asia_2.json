They constitute the world 's largest ethnic group , making up about 18% of the global population . The estimated 1.3 billion Han Chinese people are mostly concentrated in mainland China , where they make up about 92 percent of the total population . In Taiwan they make about 95% of the population . People of Han Chinese descent also make up around 75% of the total population of Singapore . The Han Chinese trace a common ancestry to the Huaxia , a name for the initial confederation of agricultural tribes living along the Yellow River . The term Huaxia represents the collective Neolithic confederation of agricultural tribes Hua and Xia who settled along the Central Plains around the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River in northern China . The two tribes were the ancestors of the modern Han Chinese people that gave birth to Chinese civilization . In addition , the term Huaxia ( literally the civilized Xia people ) was distinctively used to represent a civilized ethnic group in contrast to what was perceived as barbaric peoples around them . In many overseas Chinese communities , the term Hua Ren ( \u534e\u4eba ; \u83ef\u4eba ; Hu\u00e1r\u00e9n ) , Hua Qiao ( \u534e\u4fa8 ; \u83ef\u50d1 ; Hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o ) or Hua Zu ( \u534e\u65cf ; \u83ef\u65cf ; Hu\u00e1z\u00fa ) may be used for people of Han Chinese ethnicity as distinct from Zhongguo Ren ( \u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba ; \u4e2d\u570b\u4eba ) which also refers to citizens of China , including people of non-Han ethnicity . Han people ( \u6c49\u4eba ; \u6f22\u4eba ; H\u00e0nr\u00e9n ) may also be used for people of ethnic Chinese descent around the world . The Han Chinese are bound together with a shared history inhabiting an ancient ancestral territory for over four thousand years , deeply rooted with many different cultural traditions and customs .",
  "/wiki/Chinese_people": "Chinese people are the various individuals or ethnic groups associated with China , usually through ancestry , ethnicity , nationality , citizenship , or other affiliation . The Han Chinese are the largest ethnic group in China , comprising approximately 92% of its mainland population .

They are also the world 's largest ethnic group , comprising approximately 18% of the global human population . Outside of China , the terms Han Chinese and Chinese are often conflated since those identifying or registered as Han Chinese are the most populous ethnic group in China . In fact , there are 55 officially-recognized ethnic minorities in China who may also identify as Chinese . Although Hong Kong and Macau are both under Chinese sovereignty , both regions are highly autonomous . Hong Kong and Macau are respectively governed by international treaties known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration . Residents of both regions can possess various nationalities . People from Taiwan , officially the Republic of China ( ROC ) , may also be referred to as Chinese in various contexts , though they are usually referred to as Taiwanese . The territory of Taiwan is disputed and the ROC has limited recognition of its sovereignty . There is also an extensive Chinese diaspora known as the Overseas Chinese .",

Chinese languages are spoken by the ethnic Chinese majority and many minority ethnic groups in China . About 1.2 billion people ( around 16% of the world 's population ) speak some form of Chinese as their first language . The varieties of Chinese are usually considered by native speakers to be regional variants of ethnic Chinese speech , without consideration of whether they are mutually intelligible . Due to their lack of mutual intelligibility , linguists generally describe them as distinct languages , perhaps hundreds , sometimes noting that they are more varied than the Romance languages . [ b ] Investigation of the historical relationships among the Sinitic languages is just getting started . Currently , most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups , based on often superficial phonetic developments , of which the most populous by far is Mandarin ( about 800 million speakers , e.g . Southwestern Mandarin ) , followed by Min ( 75 million , e.g . Southern Min ) , Wu ( 74 million , e.g . Shanghainese ) , Yue ( 68 million , e.g . Cantonese ) . These groups are unintelligible to each other , and generally many of their subgroups are mutually unintelligible as well ( e.g. , not only is Min Chinese a family of mutually unintelligible languages , but Southern Min itself is not a single language ) .",

The group includes the Beijing dialect , the basis of Standard Chinese or Standard Mandarin . Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north , the group is sometimes referred to as the Northern dialects ( \u5317\u65b9\u8bdd ; b\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0 ) . Many local Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible . Nevertheless , Mandarin is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers ( with nearly a billion ) . Mandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups , spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area , stretching from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast . This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south , combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas . Most Mandarin varieties have four tones . The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties , but some have merged them as a final glottal stop . Many Mandarin varieties , including the Beijing dialect , retain retroflex initial consonants , which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese . The capital has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium , making these dialects very influential . Some form of Mandarin has served as a national lingua franca since the 14th century .",
  "/wiki/Cantonese": "Cantonese is a variety of Chinese originating from the city of Guangzhou ( also known as Canton ) and its surrounding area in Southeastern China . It is the traditional prestige variety of the Yue Chinese dialect group , which has about 68 million native speakers . While the term Cantonese specifically refers to the prestige variety , it is often used to refer to the entire Yue subgroup of Chinese , including related but largely mutually unintelligible languages and dialects such as Taishanese . Cantonese is viewed as a vital and inseparable part of the cultural identity for its native speakers across large swaths of Southeastern China , Hong Kong , and Macau , as well as in overseas communities . In mainland China , it is the lingua franca of the province of Guangdong ( being the majority language of the Pearl River Delta ) and neighbouring areas such as Guangxi . It is the dominant and regional language of Hong Kong and Macau . Cantonese is also widely spoken amongst Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia ( most notably in Vietnam and Malaysia , as well as in Singapore and Cambodia to a lesser extent ) and throughout the Western world . Although Cantonese shares much vocabulary with Mandarin , the two varieties are mutually unintelligible because of differences in pronunciation , grammar , and lexicon . Sentence structure , in particular the placement of verbs , sometimes differs between the two varieties . A notable difference between Cantonese and Mandarin is how the spoken word is written ; both can be recorded verbatim , but very few Cantonese speakers are knowledgeable in the full Cantonese written vocabulary , so a non-verbatim formalized written form is adopted , which is more akin to the Mandarin written form . This results in the situation in which a Cantonese and a Mandarin text may look similar but are pronounced differently .",

Hakka is not mutually intelligible with Yue , Wu , Southern Min , Mandarin or other branches of Chinese , and itself contains a few mutually unintelligible varieties . It is most closely related to Gan and is sometimes classified as a variety of Gan , with a few northern Hakka varieties even being partially mutually intelligible with southern Gan . There is also a possibility that the similarities are just a result of shared areal features . Taiwan ( where Hakka is the native language of a significant minority of the island 's residents ) is a center for the study and preservation of the language . Pronunciation differences exist between the Taiwanese Hakka dialects and Mainland China 's Hakka dialects ; even in Taiwan , two major local varieties of Hakka exist . The Meixian dialect ( Moiyen ) of northeast Guangdong in China has been taken as the standard dialect by the People 's Republic of China .

Joseon was founded by Yi Seong-gye in July 1392 and was replaced by the Korean Empire in October 1897 .

The kingdom 's northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of Amnok and Tuman through the subjugation of the Jurchens . Joseon was the last dynasty of Korea and its longest-ruling Confucian dynasty . During its reign , Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of Chinese Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society . Neo-Confucianism was installed as the new dynasty 's state ideology . Buddhism was accordingly discouraged and occasionally faced persecutions by the dynasty . Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the territory of current Korea and saw the height of classical Korean culture , trade , literature , and science and technology . However , the dynasty was severely weakened during the late 16th and early 17th centuries , when the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s and the first and second Manchu invasions nearly overran the Korean Peninsula , leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy , for which the country became known as the hermit kingdom in Western literature .",

The 110,000 Dungan people of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are also considered part of the Hui ethnicity . Their culture has distinct differences that developed from the practice of Islam . For example , as Muslims , they follow Islamic dietary laws and reject the consumption of pork , the most common meat consumed in China and have given rise to their own variation of Chinese cuisine . Traditional Hui clothing differs from that of the Han primarily in that some men wear white caps ( taqiyah ) and some women wear headscarves , as is the case in many Islamic cultures . However , since the industrialization and modernization of China , most of the young Hui people wear the same clothes as mainstream fashion trends .",

In the discussion of grammar to follow , the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian ( i.e. , the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in grammar as taught in schools ) , but much of what is to be said is also valid for vernacular ( spoken ) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects , especially Chakhar . Some classify several other Mongolic languages like Buryat and Oirat as dialects of Mongolian , but this classification is not in line with the current international standard . Mongolian has vowel harmony and a complex syllabic structure for a Mongolic language that allows clusters of up to three consonants syllable-finally . It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains . While there is a basic word order , subject-object-predicate , ordering among noun phrases is relatively free , so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases . There are five voices . Verbs are marked for voice , aspect , tense , and epistemic modality/evidentiality . In sentence linking , a special role is played by converbs .

  "/wiki/Cyrillic_script": "The Cyrillic script ( /s\u026a\u02c8r\u026al\u026ak/ ) is a writing system used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic- , Turkic- and Persian-speaking countries in Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , Central Asia , and Northern Asia . In the 9th century AD the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I the Great , following the cultural and political course of his father Boris I , commissioned a new script , the Early Cyrillic alphabet , to be made at the Preslav Literary School in the First Bulgarian Empire , which would replace the Glagolitic script , produced earlier by Saints Cyril and Methodius and the same disciples that created the new Slavic script in Bulgaria . The usage of the Cyrillic script in Bulgaria was made official in 893 . The new script became the basis of alphabets used in various languages , especially those of Orthodox Slavic origin , and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian . As of 2019 [ update ] , around 250 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages , with Russia accounting for about half of them . With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007 , Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union , following Latin and Greek . Cyrillic is derived from the Greek uncial script , augmented by letters from the older Glagolitic alphabet , including some ligatures . These additional letters were used for Old Church Slavonic sounds not found in Greek . The script is named in honor of the two Byzantine brothers , Saints Cyril and Methodius , who created the Glagolitic alphabet earlier on . Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by the early disciples of Cyril and Methodius , particularly by Clement of Ohrid . In the early 18th century , the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by Peter the Great , who had recently returned from his Grand Embassy in western Europe . The new letterforms became closer to those of the Latin alphabet ; several archaic letters were removed and several letters were personally designed by Peter the Great .",

The Zhuang languages do not form a monophyletic linguistic unit , as northern and southern Zhuang languages are more closely related to other Tai languages than to each other . Northern Zhuang languages form a dialect continuum with Northern Tai varieties across the provincial border in Guizhou , which are designated as Bouyei , whereas Southern Zhuang languages form another dialect continuum with Central Tai varieties such as Nung , Tay and Caolan in Vietnam . Standard Zhuang is based on the Northern Zhuang dialect of Wuming . The Tai languages are believed to have been originally spoken in what is now southern China , with speakers of the Southwestern Tai languages ( which include Thai , Lao and Shan ) having emigrated in the face of Chinese expansion . Noting that both the Zhuang and Thai peoples have the same exonym for the Vietnamese , k\u025b\u025buA1 , from the Chinese commandery of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam , Jerold A. Edmondson posited that the split between Zhuang and the Southwestern Tai languages happened no earlier than the founding of Jiaozhi in 112 BC .

The Tu ethnic category was created in the 1950s . According to the 2000 census the total population was 241,198 and lived mostly in the Qinghai and the Gansu provinces . The 2010 census gave their number as 289,565 . The Monguor people speak the Monguor language , which belongs to the family of Mongolic languages but has been heavily influenced by both the local Chinese and Tibetan dialects . Today , nearly all Tu people also speak Chinese . Most are farmers , and some keep livestock . Their culture and the social organizations have been influenced by Tibetan Buddhism , the Confucianism , Taoism and the local beliefs . A few Tu in Huzhu and Minhe are Christian , the result of on-going American and Korean missionary work in the area .",

There are several dialects , mostly spoken by the Monguor people . A written script was devised for Huzhu Monguor ( Mongghul ) in the late 20th century , but has been little used . A division into two languages , namely Mongghul in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County and Mangghuer in Minhe Hui and Tu Autonomous County , is considered necessary by some linguists . While Mongghul was under strong influence from Tibetan , the same holds for Mangghuer and Chinese , and local dialects of Chinese such as Gangou were in turn influenced by Monguor .",

  "/wiki/Austronesian_Taiwanese": "Taiwanese indigenous peoples or formerly Taiwanese aborigines , Formosan people , Austronesian Taiwanese or G\u0101osh\u0101n people , are the indigenous peoples of Taiwan , who number almost 569,008 or 2.38% of the island 's population - or more than 800,000 people , considering the potential recognition of Taiwanese plain indigenous peoples officially in the future . Recent research suggests their ancestors may have been living on Taiwan for approximately 5,500 years in relative isolation before a major Han ( Chinese ) immigration from mainland China began in the 17th century . Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples , with linguistic and genetic ties to other Austronesian peoples . Related ethnic groups include Polynesians , most people of the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia and Brunei , among others . For centuries , Taiwan 's aboriginal inhabitants experienced economic competition and military conflict with a series of colonising newcomers . Centralised government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation , as well as continued contact with the colonisers through trade , intermarriage and other intercultural processes , have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural identity . For example , of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines ( collectively referred to as the Formosan languages ) , at least ten are now extinct , five are moribund and several are to some degree endangered . These languages are of unique historical significance , since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family . Taiwan 's Austronesian speakers were formerly distributed over much of the island 's rugged Central Mountain Range and were concentrated in villages along the alluvial plains . The bulk of contemporary Taiwanese aborigines now live in the mountains and in cities . The indigenous peoples of Taiwan have economic and social deficiencies , including a high unemployment rate and substandard education . Since the early 1980s , many aboriginal groups have been actively seeking a higher degree of political self-determination and economic development .",

There are also a few speakers in continental Asia . They are spoken by about 386 million people ( 4.9% of the world population ) . This makes it the fifth-largest language family by number of speakers . Major Austronesian languages include Malay ( Indonesian and Malaysian ) , Javanese , and Filipino ( Tagalog ) . According to some estimates , the family contains 1,257 languages , which is the second most of any language family . In 1706 , the Dutch scholar Adriaan Reland first observed similarities between the languages spoken in the Malay Archipelago and by peoples on islands in the Pacific Ocean . In the 19th century , researchers ( e.g . Wilhelm von Humboldt , Herman van der Tuuk ) started to apply the comparative method to the Austronesian languages . The first extensive study on the history of the sound system was made by the German linguist Otto Dempwolff . It included a reconstruction of the Proto-Austronesian lexicon . The term Austronesian was coined by Wilhelm Schmidt .",

Politically , they live in either Okinawa Prefecture or Kagoshima Prefecture . There are different subgroups of the Ryukyuan ethnic group , them being the Okinawan , Amami , Miyako , Yaeyama and Yonaguni peoples . Their languages make up the Ryukyuan languages , considered to be one of the two branches of the Japonic language family , the other being Japanese and its dialects . Ryukyuans are not a recognized minority group in Japan , as Japanese authorities consider them just a subgroup of the Japanese people , akin to the Yamato people . Although unrecognized , Ryukyuans constitute the largest ethnolinguistic minority group in Japan , with 1.3 million living in Okinawa Prefecture alone . Ryukyuans inhabit the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture as well . There is also a considerable Ryukyuan diaspora . As many as 600,000 more ethnic Ryukyuans and their descendants are dispersed elsewhere in Japan and worldwide ; most commonly in Brazil and , to a lesser extent , in other territories where there is also a sizable Japanese diaspora . In the majority of countries , the Ryukyuan and Japanese diaspora are not differentiated so there are no reliable statistics for the former . Recent genetic and anthropological studies indicate that the Ryukyuans are significantly related to the Yamato people ( mainland Japanese ) but have also a relative closer relation to the Ainu people , compared with the Yamato people . This is possibly explained with partially shared ancestry of the population during the J\u014dmon period ( pre 10,000 BCE - 1,000 BCE ) and with the population of the Yayoi period ( 1,000 BCE - 300 CE ) , which were migrants from other parts of East Asia ( specifically China and the Korean peninsula ) .",

The varieties of Ainu are alternately considered a group of closely related languages or divergent dialects of a single language isolate . The only surviving variety is the Hokkaido Ainu , which UNESCO lists as critically endangered . Varieties from Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands are now extinct . Placename evidence suggests Ainu was also spoken in Northern Honshu in the past . No genealogical relationship between Ainu and any other language family has been demonstrated , despite numerous attempts . Because of the history of colonization policy employed by the modern Japanese government in the Hokkaido area , the number of Ainu language speakers has gradually decreased and very few people can speak the language fluently in daily life ."
