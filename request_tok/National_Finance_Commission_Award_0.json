  "/wiki/Fiscal_year": "A fiscal year ( or financial year , or sometimes budget year ) is used in government accounting , which varies between countries , and for budget purposes . It is also used for financial reporting by businesses and other organizations . Laws in many jurisdictions require company financial reports to be prepared and published on an annual basis , but generally do not require the reporting period to align with the calendar year ( 1 January to 31 December ) . Taxation laws generally require accounting records to be maintained and taxes calculated on an annual basis , which usually corresponds to the fiscal year used for government purposes . The calculation of tax on an annual basis is especially relevant for direct taxation , such as income tax . Many annual government fees - such as Council rates , license fees , etc . - are also levied on a fiscal year basis , while others are charged on an anniversary basis . Some companies - such as Cisco Systems - end their fiscal year on the same day of the week each year , i.e . the day that is closest to a particular date ( for example , the Friday closest to 31 December ) . Under such a system , some fiscal years will have 52 weeks and others 53 weeks . The calendar year is used as the fiscal year by about 65% of publicly traded companies in the United States and for a majority of large corporations in the UK and elsewhere , with notable exceptions being in Australia , New Zealand and Japan . [ failed verification ] Many universities have a fiscal year which ends during the summer to align the fiscal year with the academic year ( and , in some cases involving public universities , with the state government 's fiscal year ) , and because the university is normally less busy during the summer months .",

Bhutto founded the PPP in 1967 on a socialist platform , and contested general elections held by President Yahya Khan in 1970 . While the Awami League won a majority of seats overall , the PPP won a majority of seats in West Pakistan ; the two parties were unable to agree on a new constitution in particular on the issue of Six Point Movement which many in West Pakistan saw as a way to break up the country . Subsequent uprisings led to the secession of Bangladesh , and Pakistan losing the war against Bangladesh-allied India in 1971 . Bhutto was handed over the presidency in December 1971 and emergency rule was imposed . When Bhutto set about rebuilding Pakistan , he stated his intention was to rebuild confidence and rebuild hope for the future .

He strengthened ties with China and Saudi Arabia , recognised Bangladesh , and hosted the second Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Lahore in 1974 .",
  "/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq ( 12 August 1924 - 17 August 1988 ) was a four-star general who became the sixth President of Pakistan after declaring martial law in 1977 . He served as the head of state from 1978 until his death in 1988 . He remains the countrys longest-serving head of state . Educated at Delhi University , Zia saw action in World War II as a British Indian Army officer in Burma and Malaya , before opting for Pakistan in 1947 and fighting as a tank commander in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 . In 1970 , he led a military training mission to Jordan , proving instrumental to defeating the Black September insurgency against King Hussein . In recognition , Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto appointed Zia Chief of Army Staff in 1976 . Following civil disorder , Zia deposed Bhutto in a military coup and declared martial law on 5 July 1977 . Bhutto was controversially tried by the Supreme Court and executed less than two years later , for allegedly authorising the murder of Nawab Muhammad Ahmed Khan Kasuri , a political opponent . Assuming the presidency in 1978 , Zia played a major role in the Soviet-Afghan War . Backed by the United States and Saudi Arabia , Zia systematically coordinated the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet occupation throughout the 1980s . This culminated in the Soviet Union 's withdrawal in 1989 , but also led to the proliferation of millions of refugees , with heroin and weaponry into Pakistan 's frontier province . On the foreign front , Zia also bolstered ties with China and the United States , and emphasised Pakistan 's role in the Islamic world , while relations with India worsened amid the Siachen conflict and accusations that Pakistan was aiding the Khalistan movement .",
