  "/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose . The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol . The presiding officer is the speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof ( and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party ) .",

  "/wiki/Confederate_Congress": "The Confederate States Congress was both the provisional and permanent legislative assembly of the Confederate States of America that existed from 1861 to 1865 . Its actions were for the most part concerned with measures to establish a new national government for the Southern revolution , and to prosecute a war that had to be sustained throughout the existence of the Confederacy . At first , it met as a provisional congress both in Montgomery , Alabama and Richmond , Virginia . The precursor to the permanent legislature was the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States , which helped establish the Confederacy as a state . Following elections held in states , refugee colonies and army camps in November 1861 , the 1st Confederate Congress met in four sessions . The 1863 elections led to many former Democrats losing to former Whigs . The 2nd Confederate Congress met in two sessions following an intersession during the military campaign season beginning November 7 , 1864 and ending on March 18 , 1865 , shortly before the downfall of the Confederacy . All legislative considerations of the Confederate Congress were secondary to winning the war for independence from the United States . These included debates whether to pass Jefferson Davis ' war measures and deliberations on alternatives to administration proposals , both of which were often denounced as discordant , regardless of the outcome . Congress was often held in low regard regardless what it did . Amidst early battlefield victories , few sacrifices were asked of the Southern people , and Congress and President Davis were in essential agreement . During the second half of the war , the Davis administration 's program became more demanding , and Congress responded by becoming more assertive in the law-making process even before the 1863 midterm elections .",

  "/wiki/Chief_Justice": "The chief justice is the presiding member of a supreme court in any of many countries with a justice system based on English common law , such as the Supreme Court of Bangladesh , the Supreme Court of Canada , the Supreme Court of Singapore , the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong , the Supreme Court of Japan , the Supreme Court of India , the Supreme Court of Pakistan , the Supreme Court of Nigeria , the Supreme Court of Nepal , the Constitutional Court of South Africa , the Supreme Court of Ireland , the Supreme Court of New Zealand , the High Court of Australia , the Supreme Court of the United States , and provincial or state supreme courts/high courts . The situation is slightly different in the three legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom . The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales ; in Northern Ireland 's courts , the equivalent position is the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland , and in the courts of Scotland the head of the judiciary of Scotland is the Lord President of the Court of Session , who is also Lord Justice General of Scotland . These three judges are not , though , part of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , which operates across all three jurisdictions and is headed by the President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom . The chief justice can be selected in many ways , but , in many nations , the position is given to the most senior justice of the court , while , in the United States , it is often the President 's most important political nomination , subject to approval by the United States Senate . Although the title of this top American jurist is , by statute , Chief Justice of the United States , the term Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is often used unofficially . In some courts , the chief justice has a different title , e.g . president of the supreme court . In other courts , the title of chief justice is used , but the court has a different name , e.g . the Supreme Court of Judicature in colonial ( British ) Ceylon , and the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia ( in the US state of West Virginia ) .",

  "/wiki/Confederate_States_Army": "The Confederate States Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America ( commonly referred to as the Confederacy ) during the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , fighting against the United States forces . On February 28 , 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate president , Jefferson Davis . Davis was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy , and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican-American War . He had also been a United States Senator from Mississippi and U.S. Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce . On March 1 , 1861 , on behalf of the Confederate government , Davis assumed control of the military situation at Charleston , South Carolina , where South Carolina state militia besieged Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor , held by a small U.S. Army garrison . By March 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army . An accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records ; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men . This does not include an unknown number of slaves who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army , such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons . Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war , they do not represent the size of the army at any given date . These numbers do not include men who served in Confederate States Navy . Although most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers , both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription , primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer . In the absence of exact records , estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts .",

Specifically , it is 18 U.S.C . ch . 37 ( 18 U.S.C . \u00a7 792 et seq . ) It was intended to prohibit interference with military operations or recruitment , to prevent insubordination in the military , and to prevent the support of United States enemies during wartime . In 1919 , the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously ruled through Schenck v. United States that the act did not violate the freedom of speech of those convicted under its provisions . The constitutionality of the law , its relationship to free speech , and the meaning of its language have been contested in court ever since .

It forbade the use of disloyal , profane , scurrilous , or abusive language about the United States government , its flag , or its armed forces or that caused others to view the American government or its institutions with contempt . Those convicted under the act generally received sentences of imprisonment for five to 20 years . The act also allowed the Postmaster General to refuse to deliver mail that met those same standards for punishable speech or opinion . It applied only to times when the United States is in war . The U.S. was in a declared state of war at the time of passage , the First World War . The law was repealed on December 13 , 1920 . Though the legislation enacted in 1918 is commonly called the Sedition Act , it was actually a set of amendments to the Espionage Act . Therefore , many studies of the Espionage Act and the Sedition Act find it difficult to report on the two acts separately . For example , one historian reports that some fifteen hundred prosecutions were carried out under the Espionage and Sedition Acts , resulting in more than a thousand convictions .",

The President of the Commission , though not formally holding the title , was widely acknowledged as Mayor under that system . In 1963 , as part of another progressive effort , this time to unseat Public Safety Commissioner Bull Connor , the form of government was again changed by referendum . Reorganized under Alabama 's Mayor Council Act of 1955 , the city government consisted of a mayor and nine at-large City Council representatives .
