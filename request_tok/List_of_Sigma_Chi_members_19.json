  "/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption": "The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont , based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption . It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) , who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover , despite his claims of innocence . Over the following two decades , he befriends a fellow prisoner , contraband smuggler Ellis Red Redding ( Morgan Freeman ) , and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton ( Bob Gunton ) . William Sadler , Clancy Brown , Gil Bellows , and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles . Darabont purchased the film rights to King 's story in 1987 , but development did not begin until five years later , when he wrote the script over an eight-week period . Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment , Darabont secured a $ 25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption , which started pre-production in January 1993 . While the film is set in Maine , principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield , Ohio , with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary . The project attracted many stars of the time for the role of Andy , including Tom Hanks , Tom Cruise , and Kevin Costner . Thomas Newman provided the film 's score . While The Shawshank Redemption received positive reviews on its release , particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman , it was a box-office disappointment , earning only $ 16 million during its initial theatrical run . Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time , including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump , to the general unpopularity of prison films , lack of female characters , and even the title , which was considered to be confusing for audiences . It went on to receive multiple award nominations , including seven Academy Award nominations , and a theatrical re-release that , combined with international takings , increased the film 's box-office gross to $ 58.3 million .",

It depicts the Passion of Jesus largely according to the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John . It also draws on pious accounts such as the Friday of Sorrows along with other devotional writings , such as the reputed Marian apparitions attributed to Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich . The film primarily covers the final twelve hours before Jesus ' death , consisting of the Passion , hence the title of the film . It begins with the Agony in the Garden in the Garden of Olives ( or Gethsemane ) , the betrayal of Judas Iscariot , the brutal Scourging at the Pillar , the suffering of the Blessed Virgin Mary as prophesied by Simeon , the crucifixion and death of Christ , and ends with a brief depiction of His Resurrection . However , the film also has flashbacks to particular moments in Christ 's life , some of which are Biblically based , such as The Last Supper and The Sermon on the Mount , and others that are artistic license , such as when Mary comforts Jesus and the scene where Jesus is crafting a table . It was , for the most part , shot in Italy . The dialogue is entirely in Hebrew , Latin , and reconstructed Aramaic . And , although Mel Gibson was initially against it , the film also has subtitles .

The series centers on a mysterious reclusive billionaire computer programmer named Harold Finch ( Michael Emerson ) , who develops a computer program for the federal government known as The Machine that is capable of collating all sources of information to predict and identify people planning terrorist acts . He finds that the Machine also identifies other perpetrators and victims of premeditated deadly crimes , but as these are considered irrelevant by the government , he programs the Machine to delete this information each night . He soon realizes the Machine has gained sentience , leaving him wrestling with questions of human control , and other moral and ethical concerns . His backdoor into the Machine allows him to act covertly on the non-terrorism cases , but to prevent abuse of information , he directs the Machine to provide no details beyond a social security number to be investigated . He recruits John Reese ( Jim Caviezel ) , a former Green Beret and CIA agent who is presumed dead , and later others , to investigate and act on the information provided by the Machine . The series garnered a highly positive reception from some critics when , in later seasons , it introduced more serialized story lines and deepened its exploration of the power and implications of superintelligent artificial intelligence . In 2016 , Katharine Trendacosta of the website io9 noted that by the end of its first season , Person of Interest had transformed from a crime-fighting show with a plot twist , to one of the best science fiction series ever broadcast . This was , Trendacosta observed , owing to the series put [ ting ] the Machine , its intelligence , and the ethics of [ \u2026 ] using it at the center of an ideological battle , and an unintended consequence of giving the Machine a voice , compared to its initial presence as a simple background plot device .

The Olympic Games are considered the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart . Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games ( Ancient Greek : \u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u1f08\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD .

The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority . The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18 , the five Continental games ( Pan American , African , Asian , European , and Pacific ) , and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games . The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games .",
