Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

  "/wiki/Transatlantic_tunnel": "A transatlantic tunnel is a theoretical tunnel that would span the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe possibly for such purposes as mass transit . Some proposals envision technologically advanced trains reaching speeds of 500 to 8,000 kilometres per hour ( 310 to 4,970 mph ) . Most conceptions of the tunnel envision it between the United States and the United Kingdom - or more specifically between New York City and London . Advantages compared to air travel could be increased speed , and use of electricity instead of scarce oil based fuel , considering a future time long after peak oil . The main barriers to constructing such a tunnel are cost with estimates of between $ 88 billion to $ 175 billion as well as the limits of current materials science . Existing major tunnels , such as the Channel Tunnel , Seikan Tunnel and the Gotthard Base Tunnel , despite using less expensive technology than any yet proposed for the transatlantic tunnel , may struggle financially [ citation needed ] .",

The company was established on June 1 , 2014 and reorganized and renamed on October 12 , 2017 . Hyperloop systems are intended to move passengers and/or cargo at airline speeds at a fraction of the cost of air travel . The concept of Hyperloop transportation was first introduced by Elon Musk on August 12 , 2013 . The planned route runs from Los Angeles , California to Las Vegas , Nevada . The original Hyperloop concept is proposed to use a linear electric motor to accelerate and decelerate an electromagnetically levitated pod through a low-pressure tube . The vehicle would glide silently for miles at speeds up to 760 mph ( 1223.1 km/h ) with very low turbulence The system is proposed to be entirely autonomous , quiet , direct-to-destination and on-demand . Additionally , as Hyperloop is proposed to be built on columns or tunneled underground , this could eliminate the dangers of at-grade crossings and require smaller rights of way than high-speed rail or a highway . Virgin Hyperloop One has made substantive technical changes to Musk 's initial proposal and chose not to pursue the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco notional route that Musk envisioned in his 2013 alpha-design white paper . The company had raised $ 295 million on December 18 , 2017 and demonstrated a form of propulsion technology on May 11 , 2016 at its test site in North Las Vegas .
