  "/wiki/Own_goal": "An own goal is an event in competitive goal-scoring sports ( such as association football or hockey ) where a player scores on his or her own side of the playing area rather than the one defended by the opponent . Since own goals are often added to the opponent 's score , they are often an embarrassing blunder for the scoring player , but in certain sports are occasionally done for strategic reasons . In some parts of the world , the term has become a metaphor for any action that backfires on the person or group undertaking it , sometimes even carrying a sense of poetic justice . During The Troubles , for instance , it acquired a specific metaphorical meaning in Belfast , referring to an IED ( improvised explosive device ) that detonated prematurely , killing the person making or handling the bomb with the intent to harm others . A player trying to throw a game might deliberately attempt an own goal . Such players run the risk of being sanctioned or banned from further play .",

  "/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)": "A penalty kick ( commonly known as a penalty or a PK ) is a method of restarting play in association football , in which a player is allowed to take a single shot on the goal while it is defended only by the opposing team 's goalkeeper . It is awarded when a foul punishable by a direct free kick is committed by a player in their own penalty area . The shot is taken from the penalty mark , which is 11 m ( 12 yards ) from the goal line and centred between the touch lines . In practice , penalty kicks result in goals more often than not , even against the best and most experienced goalkeepers . This means that penalty awards are game-changing decisions and often decisive , particularly in low-scoring games . Similar kicks are made in a penalty shootout in some tournaments to determine which team is victorious after a drawn match ; these are governed by slightly different rules .",
