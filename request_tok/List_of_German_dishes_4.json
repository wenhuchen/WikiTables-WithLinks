  "/wiki/Ratzeputz": "Ratzeputz is a schnaps , a type of spirit popular in Germany , which contains extracts and distillates of root ginger . The fresh ginger it contains is said to be beneficial to the stomach . Ratzeputz today ( 2006 ) only contains 58% alcohol ; whereas higher proportions of alcohol used to be common . The ingredients , which are found by most consumers to be sharp , are intended to leave a long aftertaste in the mouth and throat . Ratzeputz was first created in 1877 by Peter Weidmann , a distiller in Celle . In that town , the L\u00fcneburg Heath region and its surrounding area , Ratzeputz is a well-known , high-alcohol spirit-based speciality . Its strong but delicate ginger flavour has helped it gain considerable international attention as well . Originally bottled by C.W . Baland & Langebartels in Celle , it is now made under licence by Schwarze and Schlichte in Oelde . Until several years ago Ratzeputz was distilled in the centre of Celle . The reason why the strong smell in the town at weekends has gone is due to the transfer of its production to an industrial estate in Westercelle . The sales outlet immediately next to the distillery ( between Neuer Stra\u00dfe and Z\u00f6llnerstra\u00dfe ) in the town centre has also been closed and the number of different bottle sizes has been reduced ."
