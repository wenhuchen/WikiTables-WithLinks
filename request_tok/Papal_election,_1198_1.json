  "/wiki/Konrad_von_Wittelsbach": "Conrad of Wittelsbach ( ca . 1120/1125 - 25 October 1200 ) was the Archbishop of Mainz ( as Conrad I ) and Archchancellor of Germany from 20 June 1161 to 1165 and again from 1183 to his death . He was also a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . The son of Otto IV , Count of Wittelsbach , and brother of Otto I of Bavaria , he studied in Salzburg and Paris . At the Council of Lodi in 1161 , Frederick Barbarossa appointed him archbishop of Mainz to end a schism between Rudolf of Z\u00e4hringen and Christian von Buch in that see . At that same council , Barbarossa appointed Victor IV antipope in opposition to Pope Alexander III . After Victor 's death in 1164 , Rainald of Dassel , the archbishop of Cologne , chose as antipope Paschal III at Lucca . Conrad refused to support the new antipope and consequently fell out with Barbarossa . He fled to France and then Rome in 1165 and his see was bestowed on Christian von Buch , though Alexander III still recognised him as legal archbishop . On 18 December , the pope made him cardinal priest of San Marcello al Corso and then cardinal bishop of Sabina . The pope later created him bishop of Sora in Campania . Conrad fled before Christian took Rome with an imperial army .",

  "/wiki/Archbishop_of_Mainz": "The Elector of Mainz was one of the seven Prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire . As both the Archbishop of Mainz and the ruling prince of the territory , the Elector of Mainz held a powerful position during the Middle Ages . The Archbishop-Elector was president of the electoral college , arch-chancellor of the empire and primate of Germany until the dissolution of the empire in 1806 . The origin of the title dates back to 747 , when the city of Mainz was made the seat of an archbishop , and a succession of able and ambitious prelates made the district under their rule a strong and vigorous state . Among these men were important figures in the history of Germany such as Hatto I , Siegfried III , Peter of Aspelt , and Albert of Mainz . There were several violent contests between rivals for the archbishopric , and their power struggles occasionally moved the citizens of Mainz to revolt . The lands of the elector lay around the city of Mainz on both banks of the Rhine ; their area reached 3200 sq . m by the end of the Empire . The last elector was Karl Theodor von Dalberg , who lost his temporal power when the archbishopric was secularized in 1803 .",

  "/wiki/Dean_of_the_Sacred_College_of_Cardinals": "The Dean of the College of Cardinals ( Latin : Decanus Collegii S. R. E. Cardinalium ) is the leader of the College of Cardinals in the Roman Catholic Church . The position was established in the early 12th century . The Dean presides over the College of Cardinals , serving as primus inter pares in the college . He always holds the rank of cardinal bishop . The Dean of the College of Cardinals is assisted by the Vice-Dean . Both are elected by and from the Cardinal Bishops who are not Eastern Catholic patriarchs and their election is subject to papal confirmation . Except for presiding , the Dean and Vice-Dean have no power over the other cardinals . In the order of precedence in the Catholic Church as the senior Cardinal Bishops , the Dean and Vice-Dean are placed second and third , respectively , after the pope . The Dean is often , but not necessarily , the longest-serving member of the whole College . [ citation needed ] It had been customary for centuries for the longest-serving of the six cardinal bishops of suburbicarian sees to be Dean . This was required by canon law from 1917 until 1965 , when Pope Paul VI empowered the six to elect the Dean from among their number . This election was a formality until the time of Pope John Paul II .",
  "/wiki/External_cardinal": "In the category of the members of the College of Cardinals in the central Middle Ages ( 11th to 13th century ) , an external cardinal ( as opposed to a curial cardinal ) was a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church who did not reside in the Roman Curia , because of simultaneously being a bishop of the episcopal see other than suburbicarian , or abbot of an abbey situated outside Rome . In the wider sense , it may also concern cardinals who were appointed to the external episcopal sees and resigned their memberships in the College of Cardinals with this appointment . As well , it can concern cardinals who were generally curial cardinals , but for some time exercised the posts of administrators or prelates of the external churches . Today , the great majority of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries . Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope , their dignity is purely honorific . However , originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome , constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses ( called suburbicarian sees ) bordering the diocese of Rome ( cardinal-bishops ) , priests of the parochial churches of Rome ( cardinal-priests ) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome ( cardinal-deacons ) . Unlike today , the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses , parochial churches ( called tituli ) or deaconries to which they were attached . The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule , that cardinals - members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome - can not serve simultaneously in another , external church , which is now common practice .",

  "/wiki/Archbishop_of_Reims": "The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims ( Latin : Archidioecesis Remensis ; French : Archidioc\u00e8se de Reims ) is an archdiocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in France . Erected as a diocese around 250 by St. Sixtus , the diocese was elevated to an archdiocese around 750 . The archbishop received the title primate of Gallia Belgica in 1089 . In 1023 , Archbishop Ebles acquired the Countship of Reims , making him a prince-bishop ; it became a duchy and a peerage between 1060 and 1170 .

  "/wiki/Protopriest": "The Protopriest of the College of Cardinals ( Italian : protopresbitero , and , rare , Italian : protoprete ) in the College of Cardinals , is the first Cardinal-Priest in the order of precedence , hence directly after the Cardinal-bishops . This title is always attached to the most senior Cardinal Priest according to date of his creation . From the 17th century until the end of the 19th century , the Protopriest was usually assigned to the Titular church of San Lorenzo in Lucina . The protopriest has the honor of pronouncing the formal prayer for the new pope at the papal inauguration after the protodeacon ( most senior Cardinal deacon ) bestows the pallium and before the Dean of the College of Cardinals ( most senior Cardinal-bishop ) presents the Ring of the Fisherman . This last happened at the inauguration of Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 , but did not happen at the inauguration of Pope Francis in 2013 because the protopriest , Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns , then 91 years old , remained in S\u00e3o Paulo , Brazil , and did not attend .

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_France": "The Kingdom of France ( French : Royaume de France ) was a medieval and early modern monarchy in Western Europe . It was among the most powerful states in Europe and a great power since the Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years ' War . It was also an early colonial power , with possessions around the world . France originated as West Francia ( Francia Occidentalis ) , the western half of the Carolingian Empire , with the Treaty of Verdun ( 843 ) . A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987 , when Hugh Capet was elected king and founded the Capetian dynasty . The territory remained known as Francia and its ruler as rex Francorum ( king of the Franks ) well into the High Middle Ages . The first king calling himself Roi de France ( King of France ) was Philip II , in 1190 . France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines - the Valois and Bourbon - until the monarchy was abolished in 1792 during the French Revolution . France in the Middle Ages was a de-centralised , feudal monarchy . In Brittany and Catalonia ( now a part of Spain ) the authority of the French king was barely felt . Lorraine and Provence were states of the Holy Roman Empire and not yet a part of France . Initially , West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates , but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father 's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture , which became codified in the Salic law .",
  "/wiki/Ruggiero_di_San_Severino": "Roger of San Severino ( died December 1221 ) was the Archbishop of Benevento from 1179 until his death . He was probably a younger brother of Count William of San Severino , the most powerful lord in the Cilento and a royal justiciar . He may also have been a cousin of Count Robert of Caserta . He was a monk at Montecassino before becoming bishop at a young age . His high aristocratic lineage and monastic vows were both unusual for bishops of southern Italy at the time . He was appointed archbishop of Benevento and cardinal-priest of Sant'Eusebio by Pope Alexander III . In June 1180 Roger and five of his twenty-two suffragans and two other bishops visited Montecassino , where they issued an indulgence for one year 's penance to visitors of the abbey and one year and forty days ' penance to visitors on Saint Benedict 's day . In 1182 , when Roger dedicated the abbey church of Montevergine , he was accompanied by nine of his suffragans . In 1199 Roger 's own canons brought charges against him before Pope Innocent III , who sent a cardinal and the archbishop of Naples to investigate . Among the charges was that Roger had encouraged the citizens of Benevento to destroy the castle ( castellum ) of a neighbouring baron with whom they were in dispute . Therefore , the canons alleged , Roger was a participant in , and master of , civil war .",

  "/wiki/Pandolfo_da_Lucca": "Pandolfo da Lucca ( 1140/45-1210/11 ) , erroneously Pandolfo Masca , was an Italian cardinal of the late 12th century . His name is sometimes given in the anglicised form Pandulf or Pandulph . Pandolfo was born in Lucca in the early 1140s . He was the son of a certain Pietro di Roberto . In the 16th century , the Spanish historian Alfonso Chac\u00f3n mistakenly assigned him to the noble Masca family from the Pisan commune , an error finally caught in 1844 by Domenico Barsocchini , who found a document from 1208 naming Pandolfo 's father . Pandolfo commissioned several paintings from Tuscany on the orders of Callixtus II , for which he was made sub-deacon of the apostolic seat . He was created a cardinal by Pope Lucius III in December 1182 with the title ( titulus ) of Santi XII Apostoli . He held this title at the time of the five papal elections at which he was present - Pope Urban III on November 25 , 1185 ; Pope Gregory VIII on October 21 , 1187 ; Pope Clement III on December 17-19 , 1187 ; Pope Celestine III on March 25 ( ? ) - 30 , 1191 ; and Pope Innocent III on January 8 , 1198 . He subscribed the papal bulls between January 4 , 1183 and November 11 , 1200 . Pope Celestine III , wanting peace between Genoa and Pisa , sent Masca to Tuscany but , as for Lerici , at 1196 peace negotiations it proved impossible to arrive at an understanding . Anti-imperialist sentiment was also growing in Tuscany and , following the example of the Lombard League , a new league was formed , the League of San Genesio or the Tuscan League .",

The second monastery was established by Petronax of Brescia around 718 , at the suggestion of Pope Gregory II and with the support of the Lombard Duke Romuald II of Benevento . It was directly subject to the pope and many monasteries in Italy were under its authority . In 883 the monastery was sacked by Saracens and abandoned again . The community of monks resided first at Teano and then from 914 at Capua before the monastery was rebuilt in 949 . During the period of exile , the Cluniac Reforms were introduced into the community . The 11th and 12th centuries were the abbey 's golden age .
