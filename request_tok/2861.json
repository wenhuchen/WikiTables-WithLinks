  "/wiki/Bobsled_roller_coaster": "A bobsled roller coaster is a roller coaster that uses a track design that is essentially a pipe with the top half removed and has cars that are sent down this pipe in a freewheeling mode . The name derives from the great similarity to the track design used for the winter sport of bobsleigh . Most modern bobsled roller coasters are made of steel ; however , the first bobsled coasters , known as Flying Turns , were made of wood . On Oct 4 , 2013 , after seven years of construction , Knoebels in Pennsylvania opened the world 's only modern wooden flying turns coaster , Flying Turns . The ride was scheduled to open in 2007 , but had been delayed due to dysfunctional wheels and other issues . As there were no historic plans available , the new coaster was designed entirely from scratch . Both the bobsled coaster and the flying turns coaster are buildable in the RollerCoaster Tycoon and Thrillville series of video games .",

Depending on carrier size and loading efficiency , a passenger ropeway can move up to 4000 people per hour , and the fastest lifts achieve operating speeds of up to 12 m/s ( 39.4 ft/s ) or 43.2 km/h ( 26.8 mph ) . The two-person double chair , which for many years was the workhorse of the ski industry , can move roughly 1200 people per hour at rope speeds of up to 2.5 m/s ( 8.2 ft/s ) . The four person detachable chairlift ( high-speed quad ) can transport 2400 people per hour with an average rope speed of 5 m/s ( 16.4 ft/s ) . Some bi and tri cable elevated ropeways and reversible tramways achieve much greater operating speeds ."
