  "/wiki/Radar": "Radar is a detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range , angle , or velocity of objects . It can be used to detect aircraft , ships , spacecraft , guided missiles , motor vehicles , weather formations , and terrain . A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain , a transmitting antenna , a receiving antenna ( often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving ) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object ( s ) . Radio waves ( pulsed or continuous ) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver , giving information about the object 's location and speed . Radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II . A key development was the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom , which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution . The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging . The term radar has since entered English and other languages as a common noun , losing all capitalization.The following derivation was also suggested during RAF RADAR courses in 1954/5 : at Yatesbury Training Camp : Radio Azimuth Direction And Ranging . The modern uses of radar are highly diverse , including air and terrestrial traffic control , radar astronomy , air-defense systems , antimissile systems , marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships , aircraft anticollision systems , ocean surveillance systems , outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems , meteorological precipitation monitoring , altimetry and flight control systems , guided missile target locating systems , and ground-penetrating radar for geological observations . High tech radar systems are associated with digital signal processing , machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very high noise levels . Radar is a key technology that the self-driving systems are mainly designed to use , along with sonar and other sensors . Other systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Air_Force": "The Royal Air Force ( RAF ) is the United Kingdom 's aerial warfare force . It was formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918 . Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as , at the time , the largest air force in the world . Since its formation , the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history . In particular , it played a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign , the Battle of Britain . The RAF 's mission is to support the objectives of the British Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , which are to provide the capabilities needed to ensure the security and defence of the United Kingdom and overseas territories , including against terrorism ; to support the Government 's foreign policy objectives particularly in promoting international peace and security . The RAF describes its mission statement as . [ to provide ] an agile , adaptable and capable Air Force that , person for person , is second to none , and that makes a decisive air power contribution in support of the UK Defence Mission . The mission statement is supported by the RAF 's definition of air power , which guides its strategy . Air power is defined as the ability to project power from the air and space to influence the behaviour of people or the course of events . Today the Royal Air Force maintains an operational fleet of various types of aircraft , described by the RAF as being leading-edge in terms of technology . This largely consists of fixed-wing aircraft , including : fighter and strike aircraft , airborne early warning and control aircraft , ISTAR and SIGINT aircraft , aerial refueling aircraft and strategic and tactical transport aircraft .",
  "/wiki/Early_warning_radar": "An early-warning radar is any radar system used primarily for the long-range detection of its targets , i.e. , allowing defences to be alerted as early as possible before the intruder reaches its target , giving the air defences the maximum time in which to operate . This contrasts with systems used primarily for tracking or gun laying , which tend to offer shorter ranges but offer much higher accuracy . EW radars tend to share a number of design features that improve their performance in the role . For instance , EW radar typically operates at lower frequencies , and thus longer wavelengths , than other types . This greatly reduces their interaction with rain and snow in the air , and therefore improves their performance in the long-range role where their coverage area will often include precipitation . This also has the side-effect of lowering their optical resolution , but this is not important in this role . Likewise , EW radars often use much lower pulse repetition frequency to maximize their range , at the cost of signal strength , and offset this with long pulse widths , which increases the signal at the cost of lowering range resolution . The canonical EW radar is the British Chain Home system , which entered full-time service in 1938 . It used a very low pulse repetition of 25 pps and very powerful transmissions ( for the era ) reaching 1 MW in late-war upgrades . The German Freya and US CXAM ( Navy ) and SCR-270 ( Army ) were similar . Post-war models moved to the microwave range in ever-increasingly powerful models that reached the 50 MW range by the 1960s . Since then , improvements in receiver electronics has greatly reduced the amount of signal needed to produce an accurate image , and modern examples the transmitted power is much less ; the AN/FPS-117 offers 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ; 290 mi ) range from 25 kW .",
  "/wiki/Air_defence_systems": "Anti-aircraft warfare or counter-air defence is defined by NATO as all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action . They include surface based , subsurface ( submarine launched ) , and air-based weapon systems , associated sensor systems , command and control arrangements and passive measures ( e.g . barrage balloons ) . It may be used to protect naval , ground , and air forces in any location . However , for most countries the main effort has tended to be 'homeland defence ' . NATO refers to airborne air defence as counter-air and naval air defence as anti-aircraft warfare . Missile defence is an extension of air defence as are initiatives to adapt air defence to the task of intercepting any projectile in flight . In some countries , such as Britain and Germany during the Second World War , the Soviet Union , NATO , and the United States , ground-based air defence and air defence aircraft have been under integrated command and control . However , while overall air defence may be for homeland defence including military facilities , forces in the field , wherever they are , invariably deploy their own air defence capability if there is an air threat . A surface-based air defence capability can also be deployed offensively to deny the use of airspace to an opponent . Until the 1950s , guns firing ballistic munitions ranging from 7.62 mm to 152.4 mm [ citation needed ] were the standard weapons ; guided missiles then became dominant , except at the very shortest ranges ( as with close-in weapon systems , which typically use rotary autocannons or , in very modern systems , surface-to-air adaptations of short range air-to-air missiles , often combined in one system with rotary cannons ) .",
  "/wiki/Air_traffic_control": "Air traffic control ( ATC ) is a service provided by ground-based air traffic controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and through controlled airspace , and can provide advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled airspace . The primary purpose of ATC worldwide is to prevent collisions , organize and expedite the flow of air traffic , and provide information and other support for pilots . In some countries , ATC plays a security or defensive role , or is operated by the military . Air traffic controllers monitor the location of aircraft in their assigned airspace by radar and communicate with the pilots by radio . To prevent collisions , ATC enforces traffic separation rules , which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of empty space around it at all times . In many countries , ATC provides services to all private , military , and commercial aircraft operating within its airspace . Depending on the type of flight and the class of airspace , ATC may issue instructions that pilots are required to obey , or advisories ( known as flight information in some countries ) that pilots may , at their discretion , disregard . The pilot in command is the final authority for the safe operation of the aircraft and may , in an emergency , deviate from ATC instructions to the extent required to maintain safe operation of their aircraft .",
  "/wiki/Microwave_oven": "A microwave oven ( commonly referred to as a microwave ) is an electric oven that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range . This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating . Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25-38 mm ( 1-1.5 inches ) of a homogeneous , high water content food item . The development of the cavity magnetron made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength ( microwaves ) . American engineer Percy Spencer is generally credited with inventing the modern microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed during the war . Named the Radarange , it was first sold in 1946 . Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was first introduced by Tappan in 1955 , but these units were still too large and expensive for general home use . Sharp Corporation introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable between 1964 and 1966 . The countertop microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation . After Sharp introduced low-cost microwave ovens affordable for residential use in the late 1970s , their use spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world . In addition to their use in cooking food , microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes . Microwave ovens are a common kitchen appliance and are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods .",
  "/wiki/Walkie-talkie": "A walkie-talkie ( more formally known as a handheld transceiver , or HT ) is a hand-held , portable , two-way radio transceiver . Its development during the Second World War has been variously credited to Donald L. Hings , radio engineer Alfred J . Gross , and engineering teams at Motorola . First used for infantry , similar designs were created for field artillery and tank units , and after the war , walkie-talkies spread to public safety and eventually commercial and jobsite work . Typical walkie-talkies resemble a telephone handset , with a speaker built into one end and a microphone in the other ( in some devices the speaker also is used as the microphone ) and an antenna mounted on the top of the unit . They are held up to the face to talk . A walkie-talkie is a half-duplex communication device . Multiple walkie-talkies use a single radio channel , and only one radio on the channel can transmit at a time , although any number can listen . The transceiver is normally in receive mode ; when the user wants to talk they must press a push-to-talk ( PTT ) button that turns off the receiver and turns on the transmitter .",

  "/wiki/Amateur_radio": "Amateur radio , also known as ham radio , is the use of radio frequency spectrum for purposes of non-commercial exchange of messages , wireless experimentation , self-training , private recreation , radiosport , contesting , and emergency communication . The term amateur is used to specify a duly authorised person interested in radioelectric practice with a purely personal aim and without pecuniary interest ; ( either direct monetary or other similar reward ) and to differentiate it from commercial broadcasting , public safety ( such as police and fire ) , or professional two-way radio services ( such as maritime , aviation , taxis , etc. ) . The amateur radio service ( amateur service and amateur-satellite service ) is established by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) through the Radio Regulations . National governments regulate technical and operational characteristics of transmissions and issue individual stations licenses with an identifying call sign . Prospective amateur operators are tested for their understanding of key concepts in electronics and the host government 's radio regulations . Radio amateurs use a variety of voice , text , image , and data communications modes and have access to frequency allocations throughout the RF spectrum . This enables communication across a city , region , country , continent , the world , or even into space . In many countries , amateur radio operators may also send , receive , or relay radio communications between computers or transceivers connected to secure virtual private networks on the Internet . Amateur radio is officially represented and coordinated by the International Amateur Radio Union ( IARU ) , which is organized in three regions and has as its members the national amateur radio societies which exist in most countries . According to an estimate made in 2011 by the American Radio Relay League , two million people throughout the world are regularly involved with amateur radio . About 830,000 amateur radio stations are located in IARU Region 2 ( the Americas ) followed by IARU Region 3 ( South and East Asia and the Pacific Ocean ) with about 750,000 stations .

The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law .

  "/wiki/Duct_tape": "Duct tape , also called duck tape , is cloth- or scrim-backed pressure-sensitive tape , often coated with polyethylene . There are a variety of constructions using different backings and adhesives , and the term 'duct tape ' is often used to refer to all sorts of different cloth tapes of differing purposes . Duct tape is often confused with gaffer tape ( which is designed to be non-reflective and cleanly removed , unlike duct tape ) . Another variation is heat-resistant foil ( not cloth ) duct tape useful for sealing heating and cooling ducts , produced because standard duct tape fails quickly when used on heating ducts . Duct tape is generally silvery gray , but also available in other colors and even printed designs .

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization .

  "/wiki/Space_exploration": "Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space . While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes , its physical exploration though is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight . While the observation of objects in space , known as astronomy , predates reliable recorded history , it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality . Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research , national prestige , uniting different nations , ensuring the future survival of humanity , and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries . Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold War . The early era of space exploration was driven by a Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States . The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth , the Soviet Union 's Sputnik 1 , on 4 October 1957 , and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period . The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones , including the first living being in orbit in 1957 , the first human spaceflight ( Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 ) in 1961 , the first spacewalk ( by Alexei Leonov ) on 18 March 1965 , the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966 , and the launch of the first space station ( Salyut 1 ) in 1971 . After the first 20 years of exploration , focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware , such as the Space Shuttle program , and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station ( ISS ) . With the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011 , plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux . Constellation , a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009 . The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit ( LEO ) , envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020 , transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector , and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO , such as Earth-Moon L1 , the Moon , Earth-Sun L2 , near-Earth asteroids , and Phobos or Mars orbit .",
  "/wiki/Communication_satellites": "A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder ; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth . Communications satellites are used for television , telephone , radio , internet , and military applications . There are about 2,000 communications satellites in Earth 's orbit , used by both private and government organizations . Many are in geostationary orbit 22,236 miles ( 35,785 km ) above the equator , so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky , so the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track it . The high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth . The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points . Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies . To avoid signal interference , international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or bands certain organizations are allowed to use . This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference .",
  "/wiki/Weather_satellite": "The weather satellite is a type of satellite that is primarily used to monitor the weather and climate of the Earth . Satellites can be polar orbiting , covering the entire Earth asynchronously , or geostationary , hovering over the same spot on the equator . Meteorological satellites see more than clouds : city lights , fires , effects of pollution , auroras , sand and dust storms , snow cover , ice mapping , boundaries of ocean currents , energy flows , etc . Other types of environmental information are collected using weather satellites . Weather satellite images helped in monitoring the volcanic ash cloud from Mount St. Helens and activity from other volcanoes such as Mount Etna . Smoke from fires in the western United States such as Colorado and Utah have also been monitored . El Ni\u00f1o and its effects on weather are monitored daily from satellite images . The Antarctic ozone hole is mapped from weather satellite data . Collectively , weather satellites flown by the U.S. , Europe , India , China , Russia , and Japan provide nearly continuous observations for a global weather watch .",
  "/wiki/GPS": "The Global Positioning System ( GPS ) , originally NAVSTAR GPS , is a satellite-based radionavigation system owned by the United States government and operated by the United States Space Force . It is one of the global navigation satellite systems ( GNSS ) that provides geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites . Obstacles such as mountains and buildings block the relatively weak GPS signals . The GPS does not require the user to transmit any data , and it operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception , though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information . The GPS provides critical positioning capabilities to military , civil , and commercial users around the world . The United States government created the system , maintains it , and makes it freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver . The GPS project was started by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1973 , with the first prototype spacecraft launched in 1978 and the full constellation of 24 satellites operational in 1993 . Originally limited to use by the United States military , civilian use was allowed from the 1980s thanks to an executive order from President Ronald Reagan . Advances in technology and new demands on the existing system have now led to efforts to modernize the GPS and implement the next generation of GPS Block IIIA satellites and Next Generation Operational Control System ( OCX ) . Announcements from Vice President Al Gore and the White House in 1998 initiated these changes . In 2000 , the U.S. Congress authorized the modernization effort , GPS III . During the 1990s , GPS quality was degraded by the United States government in a program called Selective Availability ; this was discontinued in May 2000 by a law signed by President Bill Clinton .",

  "/wiki/Manhattan_Project": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons . It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada . From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $ 2 billion ( about $ 23 billion in 2018 dollars ) . Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada . Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war : a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon . The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium , and therefore a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235 , an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium . Chemically identical to the most common isotope , uranium-238 , and with almost the same mass , it proved difficult to separate the two .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_weapons": "A nuclear weapon ( also called an atom bomb , nuke , atomic bomb , nuclear warhead , A-bomb , or nuclear bomb ) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions , either fission ( fission bomb ) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions ( thermonuclear bomb ) . Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter . The first test of a fission ( atomic ) bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT ( 84 TJ ) . The first thermonuclear ( hydrogen ) bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT ( 42 PJ ) . A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of TNT ( 5.0 PJ ) . A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast , fire , and radiation . Since they are weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy . Nuclear weapons have been used twice in war , both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed Little Boy over the Japanese city of Hiroshima ; three days later , on August 9 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed Fat Man over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel . The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan 's surrender are subjects of debate . Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_medicine": "Nuclear medicine is a medical specialty involving the application of radioactive substances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease . Nuclear medicine imaging , in a sense , is radiology done inside out or endoradiology because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than radiation that is generated by external sources like X-rays . In addition , nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy but the function and for such reason , it is called a physiological imaging modality . Single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) and positron emission tomography ( PET ) scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_power": "Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat , which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant . Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission , nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions . Presently , the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium . Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators . Generating electricity from fusion power remains at the focus of international research . This article mostly deals with nuclear fission power for electricity generation . Civilian nuclear power supplied 2,563 terawatt hours ( TWh ) of electricity in 2018 , equivalent to about 10% of global electricity generation , and was the second largest low-carbon power source after hydroelectricity . As of December 2019 , there are 443 civilian fission reactors in the world , with a combined electrical capacity of 395 gigawatt ( GW ) . There are also 56 nuclear power reactors under construction and 109 reactors planned , with a combined capacity of 60 GW and 120 GW , respectively . Most reactors under construction are generation III reactors in Asia . Nuclear power has one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated compared to other energy sources . Coal , petroleum , natural gas and hydroelectricity each have caused more fatalities per unit of energy due to air pollution and accidents .",
  "/wiki/Jet_engine": "A jet engine is a type of reaction engine discharging a fast-moving jet that generates thrust by jet propulsion . While this broad definition can include rocket , water jet , and hybrid propulsion , the term jet engine typically refers to an airbreathing jet engine such as a turbojet , turbofan , ramjet , or pulse jet . In general , jet engines are combustion engines . Airbreathing jet engines typically feature a rotating air compressor powered by a turbine , with the leftover power providing thrust through the propelling nozzle - this process is known as the Brayton thermodynamic cycle . Jet aircraft use such engines for long-distance travel . Early jet aircraft used turbojet engines that were relatively inefficient for subsonic flight . Most modern subsonic jet aircraft use more complex high-bypass turbofan engines . They give higher speed and greater fuel efficiency than piston and propeller aeroengines over long distances . A few air-breathing engines made for high speed applications ( ramjets and scramjets ) use the ram effect of the vehicle 's speed instead of a mechanical compressor . The thrust of a typical jetliner engine went from 5,000 lbf ( 22,000 N ) ( de Havilland Ghost turbojet ) in the 1950s to 115,000 lbf ( 510,000 N ) ( General Electric GE90 turbofan ) in the 1990s , and their reliability went from 40 in-flight shutdowns per 100,000 engine flight hours to less than 1 per 100,000 in the late 1990s . This , combined with greatly decreased fuel consumption , permitted routine transatlantic flight by twin-engined airliners by the turn of the century , where previously a similar journey would have required multiple fuel stops .",
  "/wiki/Hans_von_Ohain": "Hans Joachim Pabst von Ohain ( 14 December 1911 - 13 March 1998 ) was a German physicist , and the designer of the first operational jet engine . His first design ran in March 1937 , and it was one of his engines that powered the world 's first flyable all-jet aircraft , the prototype of the Heinkel He 178 ( He 178 V1 ) in late August 1939 . In spite of these early successes , other German designs quickly eclipsed Ohain 's , and none of his engine designs entered widespread production or operational use . Ohain started to develop his first turbojet engine designs independently during the same period that Frank Whittle was working on his own similar designs in Britain , and their turbojet designs are said by some to be an example of simultaneous invention . However , Frank Whittle was already working on his design in the late 1920s and openly patented the design in 1930 , a full seven years before Ohain 's design ran . Ohain 's first jet engine , the Heinkel HeS 1 , ran successfully in April 1937 , the same month that Whittle 's first engine , the Power Jets WU First Model , also ran successfully . Ohain 's jet engine was the first to fly operationally within the Heinkel He 178 aircraft in 1939 , which was followed by Whittle 's engine with-in the Gloster E.28/39 in 1941 . Operational jet fighter aircraft from both Germany and Britain entered operational use virtually simultaneously in July , 1944 . After the war the two men met and became friends .",
  "/wiki/Frank_Whittle": "Air Commodore Sir Frank Whittle , OM , KBE , CB , FRS , FRAeS ( 1 June 1907 - 9 August 1996 ) was an English Royal Air Force air officer . He is credited with single-handedly inventing the turbojet engine . A patent was submitted by Maxime Guillaume in 1921 for a similar invention ; however , this was technically unfeasible at the time . Whittle 's jet engines were developed some years earlier than those of Germany 's Hans von Ohain who was the designer of the first operational turbojet engine . From an early age , Whittle demonstrated an aptitude for engineering and an interest in flying . At first he was turned down by the RAF but , determined to join the Royal Air Force , he overcame his physical limitations and was accepted and sent to No . 2 School of Technical Training to join No 1 Squadron of Cranwell Aircraft Apprentices . He was taught the theory of aircraft engines and gained practical experience in the engineering workshops . His academic and practical abilities as an Aircraft Apprentice earned him a place on the officer training course at Cranwell . He excelled in his studies and became an accomplished pilot . While writing his thesis there he formulated the fundamental concepts that led to the creation of the turbojet engine , taking out a patent on his design in 1930 . His performance on an officers ' engineering course earned him a place on a further course at Peterhouse , Cambridge , where he graduated with a First .",
  "/wiki/Airliners": "An airliner is a type of aircraft for transporting passengers and air cargo . Such aircraft are most often operated by airlines . Although the definition of an airliner can vary from country to country , an airliner is typically defined as an aeroplane intended for carrying multiple passengers or cargo in commercial service . The largest of them are wide-body jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin . These are usually used for long-haul flights between airline hubs and major cities . A smaller , more common class of airliners is the narrow-body or single-aisle . These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts . Regional airliners typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by turbofans or turboprops . These airliners are the non-mainline counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers , legacy carriers , and flag carriers , and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs . These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub-and-spoke air transport model . The lightest ( light aircraft , list of light transport aircraft ) of short-haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft , commuterliners , feederliners , and air taxis , depending on their size , engines , how they are marketed , region of the world , and seating configurations . The Beechcraft 1900 , for example , has only 19 seats .",
  "/wiki/Digital_photography": "Digital photography uses cameras containing arrays of electronic photodetectors to capture images focused by a lens , as opposed to an exposure on photographic film . The captured images are digitized and stored as a computer file ready for further digital processing , viewing , electronic publishing , or digital printing . Until the advent of such technology , photographs were made by exposing light sensitive photographic film and paper , which was processed in liquid chemical solutions to develop and stabilize the image . Digital photographs are typically created solely by computer-based photoelectric and mechanical techniques , without wet bath chemical processing . The first consumer digital cameras were marketed in the late 1990s . Professionals gravitated to digital slowly , and were won over when their professional work required using digital files to fulfill the demands of employers and/or clients , for faster turn-around than conventional methods would allow . Starting around 2000 , digital cameras were incorporated in cell phones and in the following years , cell phone cameras became widespread , particularly due to their connectivity to social media websites and email . Since 2010 , the digital point-and-shoot and DSLR formats have also seen competition from the mirrorless digital camera format , which typically provides better image quality than the point-and-shoot or cell phone formats but comes in a smaller size and shape than the typical DSLR . Many mirrorless cameras accept interchangeable lenses and have advanced features through an electronic viewfinder , which replaces the through-the-lens finder image of the SLR format .",

Corona capsules were retrieved in mid-air as they floated down on parachutes . Later , spacecraft had digital imaging systems and downloaded the images via encrypted radio links . In the United States , most information available is on programs that existed up to 1972 , as this information has been declassified due to its age . Some information about programs prior to that time is still classified , and a small amount of information is available on subsequent missions .

  "/wiki/Internet": "The Internet ( portmanteau of interconnected network ) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) to link devices worldwide . It is a network of networks that consists of private , public , academic , business , and government networks of local to global scope , linked by a broad array of electronic , wireless , and optical networking technologies . The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services , such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web ( WWW ) , electronic mail , telephony , and file sharing . The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to build robust , fault-tolerant communication with computer networks . The primary precursor network , the ARPANET , initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s . The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s , as well as private funding for other commercial extensions , led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies , and the merger of many networks . The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet , and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional , personal , and mobile computers were connected to the network . Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s , commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life . Most traditional communication media , including telephony , radio , television , paper mail and newspapers are reshaped , redefined , or even bypassed by the Internet , giving birth to new services such as email , Internet telephony , Internet television , online music , digital newspapers , and video streaming websites . Newspaper , book , and other print publishing are adapting to website technology , or are reshaped into blogging , web feeds and online news aggregators . The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging , Internet forums , and social networking . Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs , as it enables firms to extend their brick and mortar presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online .",
  "/wiki/ARPANET": "The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) was an early packet-switching network and the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite . Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet . The ARPANET was initially founded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA ) of the United States Department of Defense . The packet-switching methodology employed in the ARPANET was based on concepts and designs by Paul Baran , Donald Davies , Leonard Kleinrock , and Lawrence Roberts . The ARPANET originally used the Network Control Program . Later , the TCP/IP communications protocols were developed by Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf , and incorporated concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin ; the ARPANET switched to TCP/IP in 1983 . As the network development progressed , protocols for internetworking were developed by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks . Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 , when the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) funded the Computer Science Network ( CSNET ) . In 1982 , the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) was introduced as the standard networking software stack in the ARPANET . In the early 1980s , the NSF funded the establishment of national supercomputing centers at several universities , and provided network access and network interconnectivity with the NSFNET project in 1986 . The ARPANET project was formally decommissioned in 1990 , after partnerships with the telecommunication industry paved the way of future commercialization of a new world-wide network , known as the Internet .",

  "/wiki/CYCLADES": "The CYCLADES computer network ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ siklad ] ) was a French research network created in the early 1970s . It was one of the pioneering networks experimenting with the concept of packet switching and , unlike the ARPANET , was explicitly designed to facilitate internetworking . The CYCLADES network was the first to make the hosts responsible for the reliable delivery of data , rather than this being a centralized service of the network itself . Datagrams were exchanged on the network using transport protocols that do not guarantee reliable delivery , but only attempt best-effort . To empower the network leaves , the hosts , to perform error-correction , the network ensured end-to-end protocol transparency , a concept later to be known as the end-to-end principle . This simplified network design , reduced network latency , and reduced the opportunities for single point failures . The experience with these concepts led to the design of key features of the Internet protocol in the ARPANET project . The network was sponsored by the French government , through the Institut de Recherche en lnformatique et en Automatique ( IRIA ) , the national research laboratory for computer science in France , now known as INRIA , which served as the co-ordinating agency . Several French computer manufacturers , research institutes and universities contributed to the effort . CYCLADES was designed and directed by Louis Pouzin .",

  "/wiki/Information": "Information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty ; it is that which answers the question of what an entity is and thus defines both its essence and nature of its characteristics . The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts . Thus the concept becomes related to notions of constraint , communication , control , data , form , education , knowledge , meaning , understanding , mental stimuli , pattern , perception , representation , and entropy . Information is associated with data , as data represents values attributed to parameters , and information is data in context and with meaning attached . Information also relates to knowledge , as knowledge signifies understanding of an abstract or concrete concept . In terms of communication , information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation . That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right , and in that sense , information is always conveyed as the content of a message . Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation ( for example , information may be encoded into a sequence of signs , or transmitted via a signal ) . It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication . The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence and is inversely proportional to that . The more uncertain an event , the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event . The bit is a typical unit of information , but other units such as the nat may be used .",
  "/wiki/Telecommunication": "Telecommunication is the transmission of signs , signals , messages , words , writings , images and sounds or information of any nature by wire , radio , optical or other electromagnetic systems . Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology . It is transmitted through a transmission medium , such as over physical media , for example , over electrical cable , or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as radio or light . Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites . A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 , and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications .

  "/wiki/Satellite_navigation": "A satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning . It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location ( longitude , latitude , and altitude/elevation ) to high precision ( within a few centimeters to metres ) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites . The system can be used for providing position , navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver ( satellite tracking ) . The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision , which allows time synchronisation . These uses are collectively known as Positioning , Navigation and Timing ( PNT ) . Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception , though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated .
