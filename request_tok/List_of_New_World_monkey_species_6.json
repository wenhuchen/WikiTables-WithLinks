He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth . Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly .",
  "/wiki/White-fronted_spider_monkey": "The white-bellied spider monkey ( Ateles belzebuth ) , also known as the white-fronted or long-haired spider monkey , is an endangered species of spider monkey , a type of New World monkey . It is found in the north-western Amazon in Colombia , Ecuador , Venezuela , Peru and Brazil , ranging as far south as the lower Ucayali River and as far east as the Branco River . In the past , the Peruvian , brown and white-cheeked spider monkeys have been treated as subspecies of A. belzebuth . As presently defined , the white-bellied spider monkey is monotypic . It has a whitish belly and a pale patch on the forehead , which , despite its common name , often is orange-buff . They live in groups of 20 to 40 individuals , splitting into small parties of 1 to 9 when in activity . Vernacular names include mono prieto , mico prieto and marimonda ( Colombia ) . Over the last 45 years ( 3 generations ) , the population has declined by approximately 50% due to habitat loss and hunting . Because of this , A. belzebuth is listed as endangered by the IUCN .",

He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and expanded and defended Lamarck 's evolutionary theories . Geoffroy 's scientific views had a transcendental flavor ( unlike Lamarck 's materialistic views ) and were similar to those of German morphologists like Lorenz Oken . He believed in the underlying unity of organismal design , and the possibility of the transmutation of species in time , amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy , paleontology , and embryology .",
  "/wiki/Peruvian_spider_monkey": "The Peruvian spider monkey ( Ateles chamek ) also known as the black-faced black spider monkey , is a species of spider monkey that lives not only in Peru , but also in Brazil and Bolivia . At two feet ( 0.6 m ) long , they are relatively large among species of monkey , and their strong , prehensile tails can be up to three feet ( 1 m ) long . Unlike many species of monkey , they have only a vestigial thumb , an adaptation which enables them to travel using brachiation . Peruvian spider monkeys live in groups of 20-30 individuals , but these groups are rarely all together simultaneously . The size and dynamics of the resulting subgroups vary with food availability and sociobehavioral activity . They prefer to eat fleshy fruit , but will change their diet in response to scarcity of ripe fruit . Individuals of this species also eat small animals , insects and leaves based on availability . Females separate from the band to give birth , typically in the fall . These females inhabit a group of core areas where resources are abundant in certain seasons . Typically , males exhibit ranging over longer distances than females , with movement of individuals enhancing the fluidity of subgroup size . Peruvian spider monkey are independent at about 10 months , with a lifespan of about 20 years .",
  "/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt": "Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt ( 14 September 1769 - 6 May 1859 ) was a Prussian polymath , geographer , naturalist , explorer , and proponent of Romantic philosophy and science . He was the younger brother of the Prussian minister , philosopher , and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt ( 1767-1835 ) . Humboldt 's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography . Humboldt 's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring . Between 1799 and 1804 , Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas , exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view . His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years . Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined ( South America and Africa in particular ) . Humboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise , Kosmos , in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture . This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity . He was the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change , in 1800 and again in 1831 , based on observations generated during his travels .",

This monkey feeds on leaves , flowers , fruits , bark , honey and small insects , and it is an important means of seed dispersal for forest trees . Females give birth after a 230-day gestation period . The population of this monkey is decreasing as its forest habitat is lost to soybean production , deforestation and road construction .

There are at least five subspecies . Some primatologists classify the black-headed spider monkey ( A. fusciceps ) , found in Panama , Colombia , and Ecuador as the same species as Geoffroy 's spider monkey .

Its arms are significantly longer than its legs , and its prehensile tail can support the entire weight of the monkey and is used as an extra limb . Its hands have only a vestigial thumb , but long , strong , hook-like fingers . These adaptations allow the monkey to move by swinging by its arms beneath the tree branches . Geoffroy 's spider monkey lives in fission-fusion societies that contain between 20 and 42 members . Its diet consists primarily of ripe fruit and it requires large tracts of forest to survive . As a result of habitat loss , hunting and capture for the pet trade , it is considered to be endangered by the IUCN .",

Oreonax has been proposed to be a subgenus of Lagothrix , but others have regarded it as a full genus .
