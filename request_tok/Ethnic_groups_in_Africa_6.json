Therefore , the spoken language is not only the most significant point of contact that the Maasai use but also one of the only ways that Maasai can continue to thrive in their traditional tribal way of life .

The name Meru refers to both the people and the region , which for many years was the only administrative unit . In 1992 , the Greater Meru was divided into three administrative units : Meru Central , ( Nyambene ) , and Tharaka-Nithi ( Tharaka and Meru South ) . After the promulgation of a new constitution in Kenya on 27 August 2010 , the Greater Meru was further re-defined and now consists of the twin counties of Tharaka-Nithi and Meru . The Greater Meru covered approximately 13,000 km2 ( 5,000 sq mi ) , stretching from the Thuci river , on the border with Embu County in the south , to the border with Isiolo County in the north . The Ameru people comprise nine sections : the Igoji , Imenti , Tigania , Mitine , Igembe , Mwimbi , Muthambi , Chuka and Tharaka . The Tharaka live in the semi-arid part of the greater Meru and they , together with the Mwimbi , Muthambi and Chuka , form the Tharaka-Nithi County . The Ameru are however unrelated to the Wameru of northern Tanzania , other than both being avid farming Bantu communities .",
