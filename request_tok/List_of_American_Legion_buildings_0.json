In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history .

The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society .
