  "intro": "The 2007 College Football Hall of Fame inductees were chosen by a ballot which consisted of 75 players and 8 coaches who were voted on by more than twelve-thousand voters for inclusion into the College Football Hall of Fame. The 2007 class was announced at a press conference in New York City at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on May 9, 2007, and was inducted at The National Football Foundations 50th Awards Dinner on December 4, 2007, also at the Waldorf-Astoria. They were then enshrined into the hall of fame in South Bend, Indiana in the summer of 2008. Once nominated for consideration, all player candidates were submitted to one of eight District Screening Committees, depending on their geographic location, which conducted a vote to determine who appeared on the ballot and represented their respective districts. Each year, 15 candidates, who are not selected for the Hall of Fame, will be named automatic holdovers and will bypass the district screening process and automatically appear on the ballot the following year. Joe Paterno was inducted this year as well, despite not being on this ballot. He was voted in on the 2006 ballot but was unable to attend the induction due to a sideline injury."
