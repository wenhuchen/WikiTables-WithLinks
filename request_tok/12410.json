  "/wiki/Guan_Di": "Guan Yu ( [ kwa\u0301n y\u0300 ] ( listen ) ; died January or February 220 ) , [ a ] courtesy name Yunchang , was a general serving under the warlord Liu Bei during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China . Along with Zhang Fei , he shared a brotherly relationship with Liu Bei and accompanied him on most of his early exploits . Guan Yu played a significant role in the events leading up to the end of the Han dynasty and the establishment of Liu Bei 's state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period . While he is remembered for his loyalty towards Liu Bei , he is also known for repaying Cao Cao 's kindness by slaying Yan Liang , a general under Cao Cao 's rival Yuan Shao , at the Battle of Boma . After Liu Bei gained control of Yi Province in 214 , Guan Yu remained in Jing Province to govern and defend the area for about seven years . In 219 , while he was away fighting Cao Cao 's forces at the Battle of Fancheng , Liu Bei 's ally Sun Quan broke the Sun-Liu alliance and sent his general L\u00fc Meng to conquer Liu Bei 's territories in Jing Province . By the time Guan Yu found out about the loss of Jing Province after his defeat at Fancheng , it was too late . He was subsequently captured in an ambush by Sun Quan 's forces and executed . Guan Yu 's life was lionised and his achievements glorified to such an extent after his death that he was deified during the Sui dynasty . Through generations of story telling , culminating in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms , his deeds and moral qualities have been given immense emphasis , making Guan Yu one of East Asia 's most popular paradigms of loyalty and righteousness . He is still worshipped by many Chinese people today in mainland China , Taiwan , Tibet , Hong Kong and among many overseas Chinese communities .
