Born in the village of Ulitino in Staritsky District of Tver Oblast , Yuri Mikhaylov took up boxing when he was young and in 1949 , he became champion of Kalininsky District of Tver Oblast . At the country 's Junior Championships , he then won a bronze medal and it seemed that Mikhaylov had a nice future in boxing ahead of him . Besides liking boxing in itself , Mikhaylov also very much liked the exercises his trainer made him do , which included elements of athletics , bicycle racing , gymnastics , and more . But then his trainer left and Mikhaylov 's new trainer forced him to do only boxing exercises . This made Mikhaylov lose interest in boxing . Mikhaylov then decided to try skating . Originally , he skated only to keep occupied doing something that would exercise his muscles , but he soon fell in love with skating and became obsessed , dreaming about skating and unable to refrain from skating even a single day . But in 1951 , he had to join the army . In the army , he was bored and he missed skating , drawing pictures of skates in letters he wrote . After having been demobilised , Mikhaylov , even more obsessed with skating than before , trained furiously and made up for all the skating he had missed while in the army . He soon started to win medals at regional championships and he made his debut at the Soviet Allround Championships in 1954 , skating only his favourite distance ( the 1500 m ) in which he finished 4th .",
