  "/wiki/CIA": "The Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States , tasked with gathering , processing , and analyzing national security information from around the world , primarily through the use of human intelligence ( HUMINT ) . As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community ( IC ) , the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States . Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates . The CIA has increasingly expanded its role , including covert paramilitary operations . One of its largest divisions , the Information Operations Center ( IOC ) , has shifted focus from counter-terrorism to offensive cyber-operations .",
