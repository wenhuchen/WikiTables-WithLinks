Under the company rule , and later under the British Raj , Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911 , when its perceived geographical disadvantages , combined with growing nationalism in Bengal , led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi .

The oldest and only surviving son of Guaram Mampali , Nasra murdered his cousin David I , curopalates of Iberia , in 881 . The reason for committing this crime probably was that Guaram Mampali prior to his death had given away his all territories which had practically left Nasra without an inheritance . After the murder , Nasra fled to the Byzantine territory from where he was retrieved by his brother-in-law Bagrat I of Abasgia . Bagrat also managed to secure the Byzantine military aid and invaded the Bagratid possessions on Nasra 's behalf . Anxious to counterbalance the Byzantine influence in the Caucasus , Ashot I of Armenia interfered in support of David Is son Adnarnase . Thus , a Bagratid dynastic feud evolved into a regional conflict . Nasra succeeded in taking the forts of Odzrkhe , Juaristsikhe and Lomsianta , but was finally defeated , captured and put to death at Aspindza .",
