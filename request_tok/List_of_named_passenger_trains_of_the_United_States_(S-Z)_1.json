  "/wiki/New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford": "The New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad ( reporting mark NH ) , commonly known as the New Haven , was a railroad that operated in the New England region of the United States from 1872 to 1968 , dominating the region 's rail traffic for the first half of the 20th century . Beginning in the 1890s and accelerating in 1903 , New York banker J. P. Morgan sought to monopolize New England transportation by arranging the NH 's acquisition of 50 companies , including other railroads and steamship lines , and building a network of electrified trolley lines that provided interurban transportation for all of southern New England . By 1912 , the New Haven operated more than 2,000 miles ( 3,200 km ) of track , with 120,000 employees , and practically monopolized traffic in a wide swath from Boston to New York City . This quest for monopoly angered Progressive Era reformers , alienated public opinion , resulted in high prices for acquisitions , and increased construction costs . Debt soared from $ 14 million in 1903 to $ 242 million in 1913 , while the advent of automobiles , trucks and buses reduced railroad profits . Also in 1913 , the federal government filed an antitrust lawsuit that forced the NH to divest its trolley systems . The line became bankrupt in 1935 , was reorganized and reduced in scope , went bankrupt again in 1961 , and in 1969 was merged with the Penn Central system , formed a year earlier by the merger of the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad ; Already a poorly conceived merger , Penn Central proceeded to go bankrupt in 1970 , becoming the largest bankruptcy in the U.S. until the Enron Corporation superseded it in 2001 . The remnants of the system now comprise Metro-North Railroad 's New Haven Line , ( parts of ) Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor , Shore Line East , parts of the MBTA , and numerous freight operators such as CSX and the Providence and Worcester Railroad . The majority of the system is now owned publicly by the states of Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts .",

The FEC was historically a Class I railroad owned by Florida East Coast Industries ( FECI ) from 2000 to 2016 , FOXX Holdings between 1983 and 2000 , and the St. Joseph Paper Company prior to 1983 . Built primarily in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century , the FEC was a project of Standard Oil principal Henry Flagler . He originally visited Florida with his first wife , Mary ; they sought assistance with the health issues she faced . A key strategist who worked closely with John D. Rockefeller building the Standard Oil Trust , Flagler noted both great potential and a lack of services during his stay at St. Augustine . He subsequently began what amounted to his second career , developing resorts , industries , and communities all along Florida 's shores abutting the Atlantic Ocean . The FEC is possibly best known for building the railroad to Key West , completed in 1912 . When the FEC 's line from the mainland to Key West was heavily damaged by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 , the State of Florida purchased the remaining right-of-way and bridges south of Dade County , and they were rebuilt into road bridges for vehicle traffic and became known as the Overseas Highway . However , a greater and lasting Flagler legacy was the developments along Florida 's eastern coast . During the Great Depression , control was purchased by heirs of the du Pont family . After 30 years of fragile financial condition , the FEC , under leadership of a new president , Ed Ball , took on the labor unions . Ball claimed the company could not afford the same costs as larger Class 1 railroads and needed to invest saved funds in its infrastructure , the condition of which was fast becoming a safety issue .",

  "/wiki/Tennessean_(train)": "The Tennessean was a named passenger train jointly operated by the Norfolk and Western Railway ( N & W ) and the Southern Railway ( SR ) . Inaugurated on May 17 , 1941 , its route ran from Washington , DC , to Lynchburg , Virginia , on the SR , then on to Bristol , Tennessee , on the N & W , terminating at Memphis Union Station via the SR . The St. Louis Southwestern Railway inaugurated a new passenger train , the Morning Star from Memphis to Dallas , specifically to provide close connections with the Tennessean at Memphis . Intended to replace the Memphis Special as the preeminent carrier on the Washington-Memphis run , one of its critical duties was the transportation of mail for the Railway Mail Service division of the Post Office Department . The train 's almost immediate success was further bolstered by a sharp rise in passenger traffic during World War II . The Tennessean carried a Bristol-Nashville sleeping car , a Chattanooga-Memphis sleeper , and a New York-Memphis sleeper . The heavyweight Pullman sleeping cars were painted silver to help them blend in with the train 's stainless-steel , streamlined baggage cars , dining cars , coaches , and observation cars . Following World War II , streamlined sleeping cars replaced the heavyweight sleepers on the Tennessean . The amenities provided on the Tennessean were gradually curtailed as Southern Railway attempted to reduce operating losses . By the early 1960s , the train carried only coaches and a single Pullman sleeper , in addition to the railway post office car and express and mail cars . Due to a decline in overall ridership , and Southern Railway 's determination to escape the expensive burden of operating Memphis Union Station , the Tennessean was discontinued on March 30 , 1968 . This discontinuance ended all Southern Railway passenger train service to Memphis , allowing abandonment of Memphis Union Station .",

  "/wiki/Norfolk_and_Western_Railway": "The Norfolk and Western Railway ( reporting mark N & W ) was a US class I railroad , formed by more than 200 railroad mergers between 1838 and 1982 . It was headquartered in Roanoke , Virginia , for most of its existence . Its motto was Precision Transportation ; it had a variety of nicknames , including King Coal and British Railway of America . During the Civil War , the N & W was the largest railroad in the Confederacy and played an important role in moving supplies for the war effort . The N & W was famous for manufacturing its own steam locomotives , which were built at the Roanoke Shops , as well as its own hopper cars . After 1960 , N & W was the last major Class I railroad using steam locomotives ; the last remaining Y class 2-8-8-2s would eventually be retired between 1964 and 1965 . In December 1959 , the N & W merged with the Virginian Railway ( reporting mark VGN ) , a longtime rival in the Pocahontas coal region . By 1970 , other mergers with the Nickel Plate Road and Wabash formed a system that operated 7,595 miles ( 12,223 km ) of road on 14,881 miles ( 23,949 km ) of track from North Carolina to New York and from Virginia to Iowa . In 1980 , the N & W merged its business operation with those of the Southern Railway , another profitable carrier to create the Norfolk Southern Corporation holding company . The N & W and the Southern Railway continued as separate railroads operating under a single holding company . On June 1 , 1982 , the Southern Railway was renamed Norfolk Southern Railway and the holding company transferred the Norfolk & Western Railway to the control of the newly renamed company . The Norfolk & Western would continue to operate on paper until 1997 , when it was fully absorbed into the Norfolk Southern during that company 's battle with CSX Transportation over control of rival Conrail .",

In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located .

Although today Illinois 's largest population center is in its northeast , the state 's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River , when the region was known as Illinois Country and was part of New France .

To create a demand for its services , the railroad set up real estate offices and sold farmland from the land grants that it was awarded by Congress . Despite the namesake , its mainline did not directly serve Santa Fe , due to the mountainous terrain , the metropolitan city of Albuquerque instead served New Mexico and the Santa Fe area . The Santa Fe was a pioneer in intermodal freight transport , an enterprise that ( at one time or another ) included a tugboat fleet and an airline , the short-lived Santa Fe Skyway . Its bus line extended passenger transportation to areas not accessible by rail , and ferryboats on the San Francisco Bay allowed travelers to complete their westward journeys to the Pacific Ocean .
