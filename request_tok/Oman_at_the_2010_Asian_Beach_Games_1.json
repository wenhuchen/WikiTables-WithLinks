Its official religion is Islam . Holding a strategically important position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf , the country shares land borders with the United Arab Emirates to the northwest , Saudi Arabia to the west , and Yemen to the southwest , and shares marine borders with Iran and Pakistan . The coast is formed by the Arabian Sea on the southeast and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast . The Madha and Musandam exclaves are surrounded by the UAE on their land borders , with the Strait of Hormuz ( which it shares with Iran ) and Gulf of Oman forming Musandam 's coastal boundaries . From the late 17th century , the Omani Sultanate was a powerful empire , vying with Portugal and the UK for influence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean . At its peak in the 19th century , Omani influence or control extended across the Strait of Hormuz to modern-day Iran and Pakistan , and as far south as Zanzibar . When its power declined in the 20th century , the sultanate came under the influence of the United Kingdom . For over 300 years , the relations built between the two empires were based on mutual benefits . The UK recognized Oman 's geographical importance as a trading hub that secured their trade lanes in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and protected their empire in the Indian sub-continent . Historically , Muscat was the principal trading port of the Persian Gulf region . Muscat was also among the most important trading ports of the Indian Ocean .",
