  "/wiki/Hittite_language": "Hittite ( natively \ud808\ude48\ud808\udd46\ud808\uddf7 ne\u0161ili [ in the language ] of Ne\u0161a ) , also known as Nesite and Neshite , was an Indo-European language that was spoken by the Hittites , a people of Bronze Age Anatolia who created an empire , centred on Hattusa , as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia . The language , now long extinct , is attested in cuneiform , in records dating from the 16th ( Anitta text ) to the 13th centuries BCE , with isolated Hittite loanwords and numerous personal names appearing in an Old Assyrian context from as early as the 20th century BCE . By the Late Bronze Age , Hittite had started losing ground to its close relative Luwian . It appears that in the 13th century BCE , Luwian was the most-widely spoken language in the Hittite capital , Hattusa . After the collapse of the Hittite Empire during the more general Late Bronze Age collapse , Luwian emerged in the Early Iron Age as the main language of the so-called Syro-Hittite states , in southwestern Anatolia and northern Syria . Hittite is the earliest-attested of the Indo-European languages and is the best-known of the Anatolian languages .",

  "/wiki/Xenophon": "Xenophon of Athens ( /\u02c8z\u025bn\u0259f\u0259n , -\u02ccf\u0252n/ ; Greek : \u039e\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd , Ancient Greek : [ ksenop\u02b0\u0254\u0302\u02d0n ] , Xenoph\u014dn ; c. 431 BC - 354 BC ) was an ancient Greek historian , philosopher , soldier , mercenary , and student of Socrates . As a soldier , Xenophon became commander of the Ten Thousand at about 30 , with noted military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge saying of him , the centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the genius of this warrior . He established the precedent for many logistical operations and was among the first to use flanking maneuvers , feints and attacks in depth . He was among the greatest commanders of antiquity . As a historian , Xenophon is known for recording the history of his time , the late-5th and early-4th centuries BC , in such works as the Hellenica , which covered the final seven years and the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War ( 431-404 BC ) , thus representing a thematic continuation of Thucydides ' History of the Peloponnesian War . As one of the Ten Thousand ( Greek mercenaries ) , Xenophon participated in Cyrus the Younger 's failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from his brother Artaxerxes II of Persia . He recounted the events in Anabasis , his most notable history . Like Plato , Xenophon is an authority on Socrates , about whom he wrote several books of dialogues ( the Memorabilia ) and an Apology of Socrates to the Jury , which recounts the philosopher 's trial in 399 BC . Despite being born an Athenian citizen , Xenophon was also associated with Sparta , the traditional enemy of Athens . His pro-oligarchic politics , military service under Spartan generals in the Persian campaign and elsewhere , and his friendship with King Agesilaus II endeared Xenophon to the Spartans . Some of his works have a pro-Spartan bias , especially the royal biography Agesilaus and the Constitution of the Spartans . Xenophon 's works span several genres and are written in plain-language Attic Greek , for which reason they serve as translation exercises for contemporary students of the Ancient Greek language .",
