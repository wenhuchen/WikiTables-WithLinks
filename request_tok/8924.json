Ancient geographers described the pass through what was then known as the Amanus Mountains as 300 paces across . Historically , it and the Amanian Gate to its north formed the most important route between the regions of Cilicia and Syria . Near the western end of the pass is the Pillar of Jonah , marking the spot where the Hebrew prophet was supposedly disgorged by the great fish that had consumed him . Around 401 BC , Cyrus the Younger passed through the Syrian Gates without a fight when his army of 100,000 - including the 10,000 Greek mercenaries immortalized by Xenophon 's Anabasis - compelled the Persian general opposing them to order his garrison to retreat . After the 333 BC Battle of Issus , Alexander the Great 's army pursued Darius III through the pass . In 39 BC , it was the scene of the Battle of Amanus Pass between Roman forces under P. Ventidius Bassus and Parthian forces under Pharnapates . The Romans completely routed the Parthian army and killed its commander , compelling Pacorus I to withdraw across the Euphrates and allow the Romans to restore their rule over Syria over the course of the next year . During the 12th and 13th centuries , the Crusaders of Antioch and Armenians of Cilicia built several fortresses along and nearby the Syrian Gates , including Trapessac at the northeast approach ; \u00c7alan , 15 kilometers ( 9.3 mi ) north of what is now Belen ; Sar\u0131 Seki at the northwest approach ; and Bagras guarding an alternate southern route between Antioch and Cilicia .
