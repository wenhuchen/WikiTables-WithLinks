New Zealand gained international attention for the Liberal reforms , especially how the state regulated labour relations . It was innovating in the areas of maximum hour regulations , minimum wage laws , and compulsory arbitration procedures . The goal was to encourage unions but discourage strikes and class conflict . The impact was especially strong on the reform movement in the United States . Coleman argues that the Liberals in 1891 lacked a clearcut ideology to guide them .
