  "/wiki/Jones_Creek_Watershed_Historic_District": "The Jones Creek Watershed Historic District is a nationally recognized historic district located southwest of Moorhead , Iowa , United States . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 . At the time of its nomination it contained 19 resources , which included eight contributing structures , nine non-contributing buildings , and two non-contributing structures . The historic district is made up of eight gully control dams erected by the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) Camp DPE-79 , working for the Soil Conservation Service ( SCS ) . They were built between 1937 ( or 1938 ) and 1941 . The project was completed by crews from the conscientious objector camp in Denison in late 1941 and 1942 . This was one of the first watershed protection projects that SCS took up in the United States , and the first in the State of Iowa . No planning documents could be found among the CCC and SCS official records . The planning for the project appears to have begun when the CCC was developing the newly created Preparation Canyon State Park nearby . Informal discussions were held between SCS engineer Robert Mayberry , local farmer Roy McCue , and CCC camp superintendent Ray Jones . At the time federally funded soil conservation work on private land was considered an inappropriate use of taxpayer money . The Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1939 changed that while this project was already under way .",
  "/wiki/Little_Sioux_River": "The Little Sioux River is a river in the United States . It rises in southwestern Minnesota near the Iowa border , and continues to flow southwest for 258 miles ( 415 km ) across northwest Iowa into the Missouri River at Little Sioux . The Little Sioux River was known as Eaneah-waudepon or Stone River to the Sioux Indians . Its tributaries include the Ocheyedan River , Maple River and the West Fork of the Little Sioux River . The Little Sioux River is integral to the Nepper Watershed Project , a major Iowa flood control and soil conservation program that was introduced in 1947 . The Little Sioux Valley was important in the Spirit Lake Massacre of 1857 , when the Santee Sioux chief Inkpaduta made forays as far downstream as Smithland . The river valley also figures prominently in folklore about the nineteenth century outlaw , Jesse James , who reportedly used the secluded valley , with its wooded ravines , as a hideout and a route north to Minnesota during the 1870s . Geologically , the Little Sioux rises in a region of glacial potholes near the Iowa Great Lakes ( Spirit Lake , and East and West Okoboji ) . It then traverses a rich agricultural region on its way to the Loess Hills , from which it then flows out onto the floodplain of the Missouri River . Through much of its middle course ( i.e. , from Linn Grove to Smithland ) the Little Sioux is a relatively wild meandered stream , with excellent canoeing , camping , and fishing opportunities . However , from Smithland downstream to its mouth , the river has been channelized and environmentally degraded . Flooding of the river is common in early to late spring , as the often-heavy winter snow melts .",

It flows into the Missouri River via a diversion channel about 5 mi ( 8 km ) west-northwest of Mondamin . At Ute , the river collects the East Soldier River , which rises near Schleswig and flows past Charter Oak . The East Soldier River collects the Middle Soldier River , which flows past Ricketts .",
