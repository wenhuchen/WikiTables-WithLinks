A Christmas Carol recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge , an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past , Present and Yet to Come . After their visits , Scrooge is transformed into a kinder , gentler man . Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions , including carols , and newer customs such as Christmas trees . He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors , including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold . Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella , and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School , one of several establishments for London 's street children . The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story . There is discussion among academics as to whether this is a fully secular story , or if it is a Christian allegory . Published on 19 December , the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve ; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released . Most critics reviewed the novella favourably .",

He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era . His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the 20th century , critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories are still widely read today . Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed readings extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms . Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense . The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features .",
