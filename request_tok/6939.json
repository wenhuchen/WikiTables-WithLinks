  "/wiki/Beach_volleyball": "Beach volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of two players on a sand court divided by a net . As in indoor volleyball , the objective of the game is to send the ball over the net and to ground it on the opponent 's side of the court , and to prevent the same effort by the opponent . Each team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net , and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively except after making a block touch ( the block touch counting as one touch , leaving only two more touches before the ball must be hit over ) . The ball is put in play with a serve - a hit by the server from behind the rear court boundary over the net to the opponents . The rally continues until the ball is grounded on the playing court , goes out , or a fault is made in the attempt to return the ball . The team that wins the rally scores a point and serves to start the following rally . The four players serve in the same sequence throughout the match , changing server each time a rally is won by the receiving team . Beach volleyball most likely originated in 1915 on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii , while the modern two-player game originated in Santa Monica , California . It has been an Olympic sport since the 1996 Summer Olympics . The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball ( FIVB ) is the international governing body for the sport , and organizes the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships and the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour .",

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete , some 600 more than expected , accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries . There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports . Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance . 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began . Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system . There have been arguments ( mostly in popular media ) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis , however , there is little or no evidence for such a correlation . The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success , with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world .",

Norway won the most gold medals while Germany won the most number of medals . The Salt Lake Games faced a bribery scandal and some local opposition during the bid . Nevertheless , from sporting and business standpoints , this was one of the most successful Winter Olympiads in history ; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs .",

International bobsleigh competitions are governed by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation , also known as FIBT from the French F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing . National competitions are often governed by bodies such as the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation and Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton . The first bobsleds were built in St. Moritz , Switzerland , in the late 19th century by wealthy tourists from Victorian Britain who were staying at the Palace Hotel owned by Caspar Badrutt . The early sleds were adapted from boys ' delivery sleds and toboggans . These eventually evolved into bobsleighs , luges and skeletons . Initially the tourists would race their hand-built contraptions down the narrow streets of St. Moritz , however , as collisions increased growing opposition from St Moritz residents led to bobsledding being eventually banned from public highways . In the winter of 1884 , Badrutt had a purpose-built run constructed near the hamlet of Cresta . The Cresta Run remains the oldest in the world and is the home of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club . It has hosted two Olympic Winter Games and is still in use . Modern Bobsleigh teams compete to complete a downhill route in the fastest times .

They were also the first since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics , under a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating , even-numbered years .

  "/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting": "Olympic weightlifting , or Olympic-style weightlifting , often simply referred to as weightlifting , is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk . The snatch is a wide-grip , one-move lift . The clean and jerk is a close-grip , two-move lift . Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category . Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors . A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an incomplete entry for the competition . The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form . In comparison with other strength sports , which test limit strength ( with or without lifting aids ) , weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits ( explosive strength ) ; the lifts are therefore executed faster - and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other strength movements . The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting , and in particular their component lifts ( e.g . squats , deadlifts , cleans ) , are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength .",

Her film , titled Olympia , pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports . Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism , and the official Nazi party paper , the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games .
