Demonstrations of narrow gauge railroading and farm equipment hobbyists accompany additional merchant stalls of cottage-craft fairs seasonally at discounted admission which is restricted to Ghost Town only . Western Trails Museum , relocated between the candy store and the General Store to accommodate Calico River Rapids ( former Bigfoot Rapids ) , still features historical western artifacts large and small , from a hand powered horse-drawn fire engine to miniature replica of a borax hauling `` Twenty Mule Team '' and utensils necessary to survive the prairie and wilderness . The Ghost Town area has a few other notable attractions . The Bird Cage Theatre only hosts two seasonal entertainments\u2014during `` Knott 's Merry Farm , '' two small productions of `` The Gift of the Magi '' and `` A Christmas Carol , '' and a Halloween Haunt thrill show . The Calico Stage , a large open-air stage in Calico Square , hosts a variety of shows and acts , big and small , from those of elementary school students , Gallagher , a local band , and the summer-spectacular All Wheels Extreme stunt show featuring youthful performers demonstrating aerial tricks with acrobatics , trampolines , and riding ramps with skates , scooters , skateboards , and freestyle bikes to popular music .

Many parts of Ghost Town are forever lost to progress . The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery , Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand , moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station . What is left of Ghost Town today was based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott , Arizona . Walter Knott inherited his uncle 's silver mill and land , then bought more of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it . In 1966 , he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico , California into a public historic park , for which it charged an entrance/parking fee . See 'History \u2013 Ghost Town \u2013 Calico ' section above . The park formerly featured a 5th area called the Wild Water Wilderness . Formerly known as Wild Water Wilderness , now part of Ghost Town , that features two major rides : the Pony Express , a horse themed family roller coaster installed in 2008 and Calico River Rapids which opened in 2019 . Nearby Pony Express is Rapids Trader , a small merchandise stand . It is also home to Mystery Lodge , a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller .

  "intro": "Knott's Berry Farm is a 160-acre (65 ha) theme park located in Buena Park, California, owned and operated by Cedar Fair. In 2018, it was the twelfth-most-visited theme park in North America and averages approximately 4 million visitors per year. The park features 40 rides including roller coasters, family rides, dark rides and water rides. The theme park began in the 1920s as a road-side berry stand run by Walter Knott along State Route 39 in California. By the 1940s, a restaurant, several shops, and other attractions had been constructed on the property to entertain a growing number of visitors, including a replica ghost town. The site continued its transformation into a modern amusement park over the next two decades, and an admission charge was added in 1968. In 1997 the park was sold to Cedar Fair for $300 million, just two years after the Knott's food business was acquired by Conagra, Inc. in 1995."
