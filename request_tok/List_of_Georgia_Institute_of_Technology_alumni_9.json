East Thrace , the part of Turkey in Europe , is separated from Anatolia by the Sea of Marmara , the Bosporus and the Dardanelles ( collectively called the Turkish Straits ) . Istanbul , mostly located on the European side , is the largest city in the country while Ankara is the capital . Turkey is bordered by Greece and Bulgaria to its northwest , the Black Sea to its north , Georgia to its northeast , Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to its east , Iraq and Syria to its southeast , the Mediterranean Sea to its south , and the Aegean Sea to its west . Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I .

  "/wiki/Truss_connector_plate": "A truss connector plate , or gang plate , is a kind of tie . Truss plates are light gauge metal plates used to connect prefabricated light frame wood trusses . They are produced by punching light gauge galvanized steel to create teeth on one side . The teeth are embedded in and hold the wooden frame components to the plate and each other . Nail plates are used to connect timber of the same thickness in the same plane . When used on trusses , they are pressed into the side of the timber using tools such as a hydraulic press or a roller . As the plate is pressed in , the teeth are all driven into the wood fibers simultaneously , and the compression between adjacent teeth reduces the tendency of the wood to split . A truss connector plate is manufactured from ASTM A653/A653M , A591 , A792/A792M , or A167 structural quality steel and is protected with zinc or zinc-aluminum alloy coatings or their stainless steel equivalent . Metal connector plates are manufactured with varying length , width and thickness ( or gauge ) and are designed to laterally transmit loads in wood . They are also known as stud ties , metal connector plates , mending plates , or nail plates . However , not all types of nail plates are approved for use in trusses and other structurally critical placements .",

  "/wiki/Control_theorist": "Control theory in control systems engineering is a subfield of mathematics that deals with the control of continuously operating dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines . The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without delay or overshoot and ensuring control stability . To do this , a controller with the requisite corrective behaviour is required . This controller monitors the controlled process variable ( PV ) , and compares it with the reference or set point ( SP ) . The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable , called the error signal , or SP-PV error , is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point . Other aspects which are also studied are controllability and observability . This is the basis for the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing , aircraft , communications and other industries . This is feedback control , which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a final control element , such as a control valve . Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram . In it the transfer function , also known as the system function or network function , is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system . Control theory dates from the 19th century , when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell . Control theory was further advanced by Edward Routh in 1874 , Charles Sturm and in 1895 , Adolf Hurwitz , who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria ; and from 1922 onwards , the development of PID control theory by Nicolas Minorsky .",

The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom .

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel .
