  "/wiki/B_Division_(New_York_City_Subway)": "The New York City Subway 's B Division consists of the lines that operate with lettered services ( A , B , C , D , E , F , G , J , L , M , N , Q , R , W , and Z ) , as well as the Franklin Avenue and Rockaway Park Shuttles . These lines and services were operated by the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) and city-owned Independent Subway System ( IND ) before the 1940 city takeover of the BMT . B Division rolling stock is wider , longer , and heavier than those of the A Division , measuring 10 or 9.75 ft ( 3,048 or 2,972 mm ) by 60 or 75 ft ( 18.29 or 22.86 m ) . The B Division is broken down into two subdivisions , B1 ( BMT ) and B2 ( IND ) , for chaining purposes . The two former systems are still sometimes referred to as the BMT Division and IND Division .",
  "/wiki/Independent_Subway_System": "The Independent Subway System ( IND or ISS ) , formerly known as the Independent City-Owned Subway System ( ICOS ) or the Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad , was a rapid transit rail system in New York City that is now part of the New York City Subway . It was first constructed as the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan in 1932 . One of three rail networks that became part of the modern New York City subway , the IND was intended to be fully owned and operated by the municipal government , in contrast to the privately operated or jointly funded Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) and Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) companies . It was merged with these two networks in 1940 . The original IND service lines are the modern subway 's A , B , C , D , E , F , G and M services . In addition , the BMT 's N , Q and R now run partly on IND trackage . The Rockaway Park Shuttle supplements the A service . For operational purposes , the IND and BMT lines and services are referred to jointly as the B Division .",
  "/wiki/IND_63rd_Street_Line": "The IND 63rd Street Line and BMT 63rd Street Line , also referred to as the 63rd Street Crosstown , Crosstown Route , or Route 131-A , are two rapid transit lines of the IND and BMT divisions of the New York City Subway system . The two lines run under 63rd Street in the Upper East Side of Manhattan , with a cross-platform interchange at the Lexington Avenue-63rd Street station . The IND line is served by F trains at all times ; it connects the IND Sixth Avenue Line in Manhattan to the IND Queens Boulevard Line in Queens . It uses the upper level of the bi-level 63rd Street Tunnel to travel under the East River between Manhattan and Queens . The BMT line is served by the Q train at all times , although a limited number of N and R trains also serve the BMT line during rush hours . Also known as the Second Avenue Connection , :128 it links the BMT Broadway Line to the Second Avenue Subway , both in Manhattan . Under the current service plan , the M crosses between the two lines at Lexington Avenue during weekends and weekday evenings . This connection has also been used in the past during service disruptions as well as during the Manhattan Bridge closures in the late 1990s . These lines were conceived as part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 's 1968 expansion plans , and along with the Archer Avenue lines and a small section of the Second Avenue Subway , they were the only portions of the plan to be completed before it was scaled back due to fiscal issues . The IND 63rd Street Line was originally planned to be extended further east into Queens as a super-express bypass of the IND Queens Boulevard Line . After these plans were abandoned in the mid-1970s , it was commonly referred to as a subway to nowhere because it ended one stop into Queens , without any infrastructure connecting to other subway lines in Queens . The 63rd Street Tunnel lay unused for over a decade , and its lower level , intended for future Long Island Rail Road ( LIRR ) service , was completed solely to support the subway line above it .",

  "/wiki/Archer_Avenue_Lines": "The Archer Avenue lines are two rapid transit lines of the New York City Subway , mostly running under Archer Avenue in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens . The two lines are built on separate levels : trains from the IND Queens Boulevard Line ( E train ) serve the upper level , and trains from the BMT Jamaica Line ( J and \u200bZ trains ) serve the lower . The two lines are separate , and do not share track connections , and therefore have different chainings and radio frequencies . The B2 ( IND Division ) Archer Avenue line uses the upper level , and the B1 ( BMT Division ) Archer Avenue line uses the lower level . These lines were conceived as part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) 's 1968 expansion plans , and along with the 63rd Street lines and a small section of the Second Avenue Subway , they were the only portions of the plan to be completed before it was scaled back due to fiscal issues . These lines were originally planned to be extended further east into Queens . Construction on the line started in 1973 , and the project was expected to be completed in 1980 . However , due to financial issues and concern about the quality of the construction , the lines did not open until December 11 , 1988 . On that date , several bus routes serving the 169th Street station were diverted to the new bus terminal at Jamaica Center . This line is also used by passengers transferring to or from the Long Island Rail Road and the AirTrain JFK .",

It runs from the Williamsburg Bridge southeast over Broadway to East New York , Brooklyn , and then east over Fulton Street and Jamaica Avenue to Jamaica , Queens . In western Jamaica , the line goes into a tunnel , becoming the lower level of the Archer Avenue Line in central Jamaica . The J and Z trains serve the entire length of the Jamaica Line , and the M serves the line west of Myrtle Avenue .

The Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) originally operated the line with westbound trains heading toward Manhattan and eastbound trains heading toward Canarsie , Middle Village , or Jamaica , generally in agreement with compass direction . However , NYCT 's railroad directions , which are north and south , replaced the BMT 's west and east railroad directions , respectively . This reclassification resulted in services which ran through the BMT Nassau Street Line to Downtown Brooklyn having two south ends . To eliminate any confusion , the directions of train services in the eastern division were switched , with trains running towards Jamaica being considered Northbound . The KK ( later K ) and current M services were an exception to this , with Jamaica , Broadway Junction , or Metropolitan Avenue remaining the south terminal , since they used the Chrystie Street Connection from the Jamaica Line to the IND Sixth Avenue Line .",

The railroad was sold to the LIRR in 1887 , and trains using the branch began serving Far Rockaway via a new connection to the old Far Rockaway Branch . The line south of Woodhaven Junction was electrified in 1905 . The wooden trestle through Jamaica Bay was subjected to numerous fires , and when combined , they took a severe toll on it . A fire on May 7 , 1950 , cut service on the middle of the line , but as the LIRR was bankrupt , it did not seek to restore service on the line ."
