  "/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)": "Ada is a structured , statically typed , imperative , and object-oriented high-level computer programming language , extended from Pascal and other languages . It has built-in language support for design-by-contract , extremely strong typing , explicit concurrency , tasks , synchronous message passing , protected objects , and non-determinism . Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors . Ada is an international standard ; the current version ( known as Ada 2012 ) is defined by ISO/IEC 8652:2012 . Ada was originally designed by a team led by French computer scientist Jean Ichbiah of CII Honeywell Bull under contract to the United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) from 1977 to 1983 to supersede over 450 programming languages used by the DoD at that time . Ada was named after Ada Lovelace ( 1815-1852 ) , who has been credited as the first computer programmer .",

  "/wiki/C++": "C++ ( /\u02ccsi\u02d0\u02ccpl\u028cs\u02c8pl\u028cs/ ) is a high-level , general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language , or C with Classes . The language has expanded significantly over time , and modern C++ has object-oriented , generic , and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation . It is almost always implemented as a compiled language , and many vendors provide C++ compilers , including the Free Software Foundation , LLVM , Microsoft , Intel , Oracle , and IBM , so it is available on many platforms . C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded , resource-constrained software and large systems , with performance , efficiency , and flexibility of use as its design highlights . C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts , with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications , including desktop applications , video games , servers ( e.g . e-commerce , Web search , or SQL servers ) , and performance-critical applications ( e.g . telephone switches or space probes ) . C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 ( informally known as C++17 ) . The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 , which was then amended by the C++03 , C++11 and C++14 standards . The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library . Before the initial standardization in 1998 , C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language ; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization . C++20 is the next planned standard , keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years .",

Eubanks attended Oklahoma State University , where he was involved as a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity . Dr. Kildall was his graduate thesis advisor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California . Eubank 's 1976 master 's thesis was a BASIC language compiler called BASIC-E designed for Kildall 's new CP/M operating system . Over the next year and a half , Eubanks wrote the popular CBASIC compiler for IMSAI while he was still a naval officer . Friends of Eubanks say he called it CBASIC because he wrote it while serving on a submarine ( at sea ) . Other people say the name CBASIC referred to commercial basic , because it incorporated BCD math which eliminated MBASIC 's rounding errors that were sometimes troublesome for accounting . In 1981 , after Microsoft moved from programming languages into operating systems , Digital Research improved its position in programming languages by acquiring Eubanks 's company , Compiler Systems . Eubanks went to work at DRI , but he soon came to doubt the company 's long-term prospects . In 1984 , Eubanks joined Symantec and from 1984 to 1986 he helped develop Q & A , an integrated database and wordprocessor with natural language query .

  "/wiki/BBC_BASIC": "BBC BASIC is a version of the BASIC programming language released in 1981 as the native programming language for the BBC Micro home/personal computer , providing a standardized language for a UK computer literacy project of the BBC . It was written mainly by Sophie Wilson . BBC BASIC , based on the older Atom BASIC for the Acorn Atom , extended contemporary microcomputer BASICs with named DEF PROC/DEF FN procedures and functions , REPEAT UNTIL loops , and IF THEN ELSE structures inspired by COMAL . The interpreter also included statements for controlling the BBC Micro 's four-channel sound output and its low-/high-resolution eight-mode graphics display . Due to a number of optimizations , BBC BASIC ran programs much faster than Microsoft BASIC running on similar machines . These included using multiple linked lists for variable lookup rather than a single long list , pre-defining the location of integer variables , and having separate integer maths routines . Speed was further improved on the BBC machine via the use of fast RAM , which allowed the MOS Technology 6502 processor and Motorola 6845 display driver to share memory without pausing for access . [ a ] As a result of these design features , BBC BASIC ran David Ahl 's Creative Computing Benchmark in 21 seconds , besting even the IBM Personal Computer , and far outpacing other 8-bit platforms . The improved BASIC 4 on the BBC Master executes the same benchmark in about seven seconds . [ citation needed ] One of the unique features of BBC BASIC was the inline assembler , allowing users to write assembly language programs for the 6502 and , later , the Zilog Z80 , NS32016 and ARM . The assembler was fully integrated into the BASIC interpreter and shared variables with it , which could be included between the [ and ] characters , saved via *SAVE and *LOAD , and called via the CALL or USR commands . This allowed developers to write not just assembly language code , but also BASIC code to emit assembly language , making it possible to use code-generation techniques and even write simple compilers in BASIC .",

It was initially conceived to work on mainframes ( the only kind of computers at that time ) , and was subsequently ported to new platforms ( minicomputers , personal computers ) as they became available . The porting of the same code on different platforms was made easier by using Mortran metalanguage macros to face systems dependencies and compilers deficiencies and differences . Speakeasy is currently available on several platforms : PCs running Windows , macOS , Linux , departmental computers and workstations running several flavors of Linux , AIX or Solaris . Speakeasy was also among the first [ citation needed ] interactive numerical computing environments , having been implemented in such a way on a CDC 3600 system , and later on IBM TSO machines as one was in beta-testing at the Argonne National Laboratory at the time .

  "/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)": "Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language , designed by Niklaus Wirth as a small , efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring . It is named in honour of the French mathematician , philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal . Based on Wirth 's book , Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs , Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language . Wirth was involved in the process to improve the language as part of the ALGOL X efforts and proposed a version known as ALGOL W. This was not accepted , and the ALGOL X process bogged down . In 1968 , Wirth decided to abandon the ALGOL X process and further improve ALGOL W , releasing this as Pascal in 1970 . On top of ALGOL 's scalars and arrays , Pascal enabled defining complex datatypes and building dynamic and recursive data structures such as lists , trees and graphs . Pascal has strong typing on all objects , which means that one type of data can not be converted or interpreted as another without explicit conversions . Unlike most languages in the C-family , Pascal allows nested procedure definitions to any level of depth , and also allows most kinds of definitions and declarations inside subroutines ( procedures and functions ) . A program is thus syntactically similar to a single procedure or function . Pascal became very successful in the 1970s , notably on the burgeoning minicomputer market . Compilers were also available for many microcomputers as the field emerged in the late 1970s . It was widely used as a teaching language in university-level programming courses in the 1980s , and also used in production settings for writing commercial software during the same period .",
  "/wiki/C_(programming_language)": "C ( /si\u02d0/ , as in the letter c ) is a general-purpose , procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming , lexical variable scope , and recursion , while a static type system prevents unintended operations . By design , C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language . Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers , from supercomputers to embedded systems . C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix . Later , it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system . During the 1980s , C gradually gained popularity . It has become one of the most widely used programming languages , with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems . C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 ( see ANSI C ) and by the International Organization for Standardization . C is an imperative procedural language . It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions , all with minimal runtime support . Despite its low-level capabilities , the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming . A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code .",
  "/wiki/ALGOL_68": "ALGOL 68 ( short for Algorithmic Language 1968 ) is an imperative computer programming language that was conceived as a successor to the ALGOL 60 programming language , designed with the goal of a much wider scope of application and more rigorously defined syntax and semantics . The complexity of the language 's definition , which runs to several hundred pages filled with non-standard terminology , made compiler implementation difficult and it was said it had no implementations and no users . This was only partially true ; ALGOL 68 did find use in a number of niche markets , notably in the United Kingdom where it was popular on International Computers Limited ( ICL ) machines , and in teaching roles . Outside these circles , use was relatively limited . Nevertheless , the contributions of ALGOL 68 to the field of computer science have been deep , wide-ranging and enduring , although many of these contributions were only publicly identified when they had reappeared in subsequently developed programming languages . Many languages were developed specifically as a response to the perceived complexity of the language , the most notable being Pascal , or were reimplementations for specific roles , like Ada . Many languages of the 1970s trace their design specifically to ALGOL 68 , selecting some features while abandoning others that were considered too complex or out-of-scope for given roles . Among these is the language C , which was directly influenced by ALGOL 68 , especially by its strong typing and structures . Most modern languages trace at least some of their syntax to either C or Pascal , and thus directly or indirectly to ALGOL 68 .",

  "/wiki/Thomas_Eugene_Kurtz": "Thomas Eugene Kurtz ( born February 22 , 1928 ) is a retired Dartmouth professor of mathematics and computer scientist , who along with his colleague John G. Kemeny set in motion the then revolutionary concept of making computers as freely available to college students as library books were , by implementing the concept of time-sharing at Dartmouth College . In his mission to allow non-expert users to interact with the computer , he co-developed the BASIC programming language ( Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code ) and the Dartmouth Time Sharing System during 1963 to 1964 . A native of Oak Park , Illinois , United States , Kurtz graduated from Knox College in 1950 , and was awarded a Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1956 , where his advisor was John Tukey , and joined the Mathematics Department of Dartmouth College that same year , where he taught statistics and numerical analysis . In 1983 , Kurtz and Kemeny co-founded a company called True BASIC , Inc. to market True BASIC , an updated version of the language . Kurtz has also served as Council Chairman and Trustee of EDUCOM , as well as Trustee and Chairman of NERComP , and on the Pierce Panel of the President 's Scientific Advisory Committee . Kurtz also served on the steering committees for the CONDUIT project and the CCUC conferences on instructional computing . In 1974 , the American Federation of Information Processing Societies gave an award to Kurtz and Kemeny at the National Computer Conference for their work on BASIC and time-sharing . In 1991 , the Computer Society honored Kurtz with the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery .",

  "/wiki/COBOL": "COBOL ( /\u02c8ko\u028ab\u0252l , -b\u0254\u02d0l/ ; an acronym for common business-oriented language ) is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use . It is imperative , procedural and , since 2002 , object-oriented . COBOL is primarily used in business , finance , and administrative systems for companies and governments . COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers , such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs . But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers , programs are being migrated to new platforms , rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages . Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications . COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous programming language design work by Grace Hopper , commonly referred to as the ( grand ) mother of COBOL . It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing . It was originally seen as a stopgap , but the Department of Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it , resulting in its widespread adoption . It was standardized in 1968 and has since been revised four times . Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming . The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014 .",
