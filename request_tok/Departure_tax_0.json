  "/wiki/US_dollar": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",
  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

It is officially used as currency by three independent Pacific Island states : Kiribati , Nauru , and Tuvalu . It is legal tender in Australia . Within Australia , it is almost always abbreviated with the dollar sign ( $ ) , with A $ or AU $ sometimes used to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies . The $ symbol precedes the amount . It is subdivided into 100 cents . The Australian dollar was introduced on 14 February 1966 to replace the pre-decimal Australian pound , with the conversion rate of A $ 2 per = A\u20a41 . The Australian dollar was legal tender of Papua New Guinea until 31 December 1975 , when the Papua New Guinean kina became sole legal tender , and of the Solomon Islands until 1977 , when the Solomon Islands dollar became sole legal tender . In 2016 , the Australian dollar was the fifth most traded currency in world foreign exchange markets , accounting for 6.9% of the world 's daily share ( down from 8.6% in 2013 ) behind the United States dollar , the European Union 's euro , the Japanese yen and the United Kingdom 's pound sterling . The Australian dollar is popular with currency traders , because of the comparatively high interest rates in Australia , the relative freedom of the foreign exchange market from government intervention , the general stability of Australia 's economy and political system , and the prevailing view that the Australian dollar offers diversification benefits in a portfolio containing the major world currencies , especially because of its greater exposure to Asian economies and the commodities cycle . As at 31 December 2016 , there were 57.71 billion US $ equivalent in Australian currency in circulation , $ 2,379.05 per person in Australia , which includes cash reserves held by the banking system and cash in circulation in other countries or held as a foreign exchange reserve .",
  "/wiki/Passenger_Movement_Charge": "The passenger movement charge ( PMC ) is a tax payable by all passengers departing Australia on international flights or sea transport , whether or not the passenger intends to return to Australia . The PMC was introduced in July 1995 ( replacing the previous departure tax which commenced in October 1978 ) and was initially described as a charge to partially offset the cost to government of the provision of passenger facilitation at airports , principally customs , immigration and quarantine functions . Since 1 July 2017 , the PMC has been A $ 60 . The PMC is a flat rate , and not a percentage of the airfare . The rate is the same for low-price ( or free or points tickets ) fares as for first-class fares , and for short distance flights as for long-haul flights . The PMC is paid by airlines and recovered from passengers as part of the fare or as a special charge ( e.g. , in the case of free or points tickets ) . According to a 2013 survey by the International Air Transport Association , the average cost of the PMC on the airfare was 3.5% . The PMC is in addition to airport fees and airline surcharges . In 2001 , when the PMC was $ 30 , the revenue from the PMC was approximately A $ 226 million per annum .",

In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa .

The yuan ( Chinese : \u5143 ; pinyin : yu\u00e1n ) is the basic unit of the renminbi , but is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally , especially in international contexts where Chinese yuan is widely used to refer to the renminbi . The distinction between renminbi and yuan is that renminbi is the name of the currency and yuan refers to its primary unit . One yuan is subdivided into 10 jiao ( Chinese : \u89d2 ; pinyin : ji\u01ceo ) , and a jiao in turn is subdivided into 10 fen ( Chinese : \u5206 ; pinyin : f\u0113n ) .

Until 2005 , the value of the renminbi was pegged to the US dollar . As China pursued its transition from central planning to a market economy and increased its participation in foreign trade , the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry . It has previously been claimed that the renminbi 's official exchange rate was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity . However more recently , appreciation actions by the Chinese government , as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the American Federal Reserve and other major central banks , have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012 . Since 2006 , the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed base rate determined with reference to a basket of world currencies .

As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro .

Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy .

Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",
