It is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus . While there is evidence showing that Kyrenia has been populated since ca . 5800-3000 BC , it is traditionally accepted that the city was founded by Achaeans from the Peloponnese after the Trojan War . As the town grew prosperous , the Romans established the foundations of its castle in the 1st century AD . Kyrenia grew in importance after the 9th century due to the safety offered by the castle , and played a pivotal role under the Lusignan rule as the city never capitulated . The castle has been most recently modified by the Venetians in the 15th century , but the city surrendered to the Ottoman Empire in 1571 . The city 's population was almost equally divided between Muslims and Christians in 1831 , with a slight Muslim majority . However , with the advent of British rule , many Turkish Cypriots fled to Anatolia , and the town came to be predominantly inhabited by Greek Cypriots . While the city suffered little intercommunal violence , its Greek Cypriot inhabitants , numbering around 2,650 , fled or were forcefully displaced in the wake of the Turkish invasion in 1974 . Currently , the city is populated by Turkish Cypriots , mainland Turkish settlers , and British expats , with a municipal population of 33,207 . Kyrenia is a cultural and economical centre , described as the tourism capital of Northern Cyprus .",
