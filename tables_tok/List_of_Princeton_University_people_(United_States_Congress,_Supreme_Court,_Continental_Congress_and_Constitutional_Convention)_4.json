  "section_title": "Constitutional Convention",
  "section_text": "The impotence of the national government under the Articles of Confederation prompted the Constitutional Convention , which met in Philadelphia between 25 May and 17 September 1787 . This assembly wrote the Constitution of the United States , which came into effect in 1789 after nine states had ratified it . [ 348 ] Princetonians represented six of the 12 states that sent delegations to the convention . ( Rhode Island declined to send a delegation . ) Ten of the 56 delegates were Princetonians , including four of the five delegates from New Jersey . This compares with five delegates each from the College of William & Mary and Yale College , three each from Harvard College and Columbia College , two from the University of Pennsylvania , and one each from the University of Oxford and the University of Glasgow . [ 349 ] James Madison was the first delegate to arrive at the convention and was so influential there that he came to be known as the `` Father of the Constitution '' . He also argued for the Constitution 's ratification in The Federalist Papers , written together with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay . As a Representative in the 1st United States Congress , he introduced the Bill of Rights , which became the first ten Amendments to the Constitution . [ 348 ] [ 350 ] William Paterson and Oliver Ellsworth were also influential at the convention . In response to Madison 's Virginia Plan , under which states would be represented in Congress in proportion to their population and taxes paid , Paterson authored the New Jersey Plan , which called for equal representation for each state . Together with his Connecticut colleague Roger Sherman , Ellsworth crafted the Connecticut Compromise , also called the Great Compromise , which blended the two plans . This plan , which specified a bicameral legislature with one house apportioned by population and the other in which the states would be represented equally , became the basis for the House of Representatives and Senate in the final Constitution .
