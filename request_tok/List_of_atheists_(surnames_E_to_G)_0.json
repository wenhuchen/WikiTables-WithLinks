He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era . His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the 20th century , critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories are still widely read today . Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed readings extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms . Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense . The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features .",

Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg , in the Austrian Empire . He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna . Upon completing his habilitation in 1885 , he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902 . Freud lived and worked in Vienna , having set up his clinical practice there in 1886 . In 1938 , Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis . He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939 . In founding psychoanalysis , Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference , establishing its central role in the analytic process . Freud 's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory . His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of repression . On this basis Freud elaborated his theory of the unconscious and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising id , ego and super-ego . Freud postulated the existence of libido , a sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments , and a death drive , the source of compulsive repetition , hate , aggression and neurotic guilt .",

  "/wiki/Cut-up_technique": "The cut-up technique ( or d\u00e9coup\u00e9 in French ) is an aleatory literary technique in which a written text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text . The concept can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s , but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer William S. Burroughs , and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts ."
