  "/wiki/Milton_Keynes": "Milton Keynes ( /ki\u02d0nz/ ( listen ) KEENZ , locally abbreviated to MK ) is a large town [ b ] in ( ceremonial ) Buckinghamshire , England , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) north-west of London . It is the principal settlement of the Borough of Milton Keynes , a unitary authority . At the 2011 Census , its population was almost 230,000 ; the Office for National Statistics estimates that it will reach 300,000 by 2025 . The River Great Ouse forms its northern boundary ; a tributary , the River Ouzel , meanders through its linear parks and balancing lakes . Approximately 25% of the urban area is parkland or woodland and includes two SSIs . In the 1960s , the UK Government decided that a further generation of new towns in the South East of England was needed to relieve housing congestion in London . The New Town ( in planning documents , New City ) of Milton Keynes was to be the biggest yet , with a target population of 250,000 , in a designated area of about 22,000 acres ( 9,000 ha ) . At designation , its area incorporated the existing towns of Bletchley , Wolverton , and Stony Stratford , along with another fifteen villages and farmland in between . These settlements had an extensive historical record since the Norman conquest ; detailed archaeological investigations prior to development revealed evidence of human occupation from the Neolithic age to modern times , including in particular the Milton Keynes Hoard of Bronze Age gold jewellery . The government established a Development Corporation ( MKDC ) to design and deliver this New City . The Corporation decided on a softer , more human-scaled landscape than in the earlier new towns but with an emphatically modernist architecture . Recognising how traditional towns and cities had become choked in traffic , they established a 'relaxed ' grid of distributor roads about 1 kilometre ( 0.62 mi ) between edges , leaving the spaces between to develop more organically .",
  "/wiki/Unitary_Authority": "A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government .

Sometimes they consist of national sub-divisions which are distinguished from others in the same country by having no lower level of administration .",
