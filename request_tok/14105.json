  "/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics": "The 1984 Summer Olympics , officially known as the Games of the XXIII Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event that was held from July 28 to August 12 , 1984 , in Los Angeles , California , United States ( and other venues around the United States ) . This was the second time that Los Angeles had hosted the Games , the first being in 1932 . California was the home state of then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan , who officially opened the Games . The logo for the 1984 Games , branded Stars in Motion , featured red , white and blue stars arranged horizontally and struck through with alternating streaks . The official mascot of the Games was Sam the Olympic Eagle . These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch . The 1984 Games were boycotted by a total of fourteen Eastern Bloc countries , including the Soviet Union and East Germany , in response to the American-led boycott of the previous 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ; Romania was the only Eastern Bloc nation that opted to attend the Games . Iran and Libya also chose to boycott the Games for unrelated reasons . Despite the field being depleted in certain sports due to the boycott , 140 National Olympic Committees took part , which was a record at the time . The United States won the most gold and overall medals , followed by Romania and West Germany . The 1984 Summer Olympics are widely considered to be the most financially successful modern Olympics and served as an example of how to run the model Olympic Games . As a result of low construction costs , coupled with a reliance on private corporate funding , the 1984 Olympic Games generated a profit of more than $ 250 million .",

The boxing schedule began on July 29 and ended on August 11 . Twelve boxing events were contested with the participation of 354 fighters from 81 countries . A Soviet-led boycott resulted in the withdrawals of the Soviet Union , Cuba , East Germany , Bulgaria and other Eastern Bloc nations from boxing competitions . At the 1980 Summer Olympics , that was impacted by an American-led boycott , Cuban boxers won 10 medals , with 6 of them being gold , and had again been expected to do well . However , the nation withdrew from the games following the announcement of the Soviet boycott . Te\u00f3filo Stevenson , who was going to try for his fourth Olympic gold medal before the boycott was officially announced , had previously defeated Tyrell Biggs twice ( one by knockout ) and Hermenegildo B\u00e1ez had previously defeated Henry Tillman . Soviet Alexander Yagubkin defeated both Biggs and Tillman during the USA-USSR duals . Cuban and Soviet boxers , however , were more seasoned than their American counterparts . While US athletes typically turned pro after the Olympics , while still in their early twenties , Cubans and the Soviets were not allowed to do so and stayed on in the amateurs , participating in multiple Olympic cycles . Journalist George Vecsey remarked after the conclusion of the games that Despite all the flag-waving euphoria in the United States over all those medals in Los Angeles , the Summer Games were a made-in-Disneyland reproduction of the Games because there were no Soviet runners , no Cuban boxers , no East German swimmers . Soviet runners and East German swimmers decades later were revealed to have been part of their respective nations ' state-sponsored doping schemes .",

  "/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics": "The 2012 Summer Olympics , formally the Games of the XXX Olympiad and commonly known as London 2012 , was an international multi-sport event that was held from 27 July to 12 August 2012 in London , United Kingdom . The first event , the group stage in women 's football , began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff , followed by the opening ceremony on 27 July . 10,768 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) participated . Following a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone , London was selected as the host city on 6 July 2005 during the 117th IOC Session in Singapore , defeating bids from Moscow , New York City , Madrid , and Paris . London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times , having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and in 1948 . Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment , with an emphasis on sustainability . The main focus was a new 200-hectare ( 490-acre ) Olympic Park , constructed on a former industrial site at Stratford , East London . The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid . The Games received general praise for their organisation , with the volunteers , the British military and public enthusiasm praised particularly highly . The opening ceremony , directed by Danny Boyle , received widespread acclaim throughout the world , particular praise from the British public and a minority of widely ranging criticisms from some social media sites . During the Games , Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time , winning his 22nd medal . Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time , so that every currently eligible country has sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games .",

The first round races were all very tightly packed , strategic affairs . The first race was the fastest , taking all but one of the time qualifiers into the semi-final . Andrew Wheating 's 3:40.92 in the second heat was the slowest time qualifier , though it was exactly equal to Nick Willis ' winning time in the last race . That race was broken up when Nixon Chepseba tripped sending several athletes scrambling to avoid the falling body . Chepseba ultimately finished 9th but was awarded a place in the semi-final on appeal , though no offending athlete was disqualified . The first semi final was strategic from the start , when the sprinting started , Taoufik Makhloufi easily took the lead and held the position . Since it was strategic , no time qualifiers came from this semi . In the other semi , Chepseba took it out at a faster pace , to avoid getting caught in traffic . At the 800 mark , Nathan Brannen fell flat and was not able to get back into contention . When the sprinting started , Abdalaati Iguider looked to be the fastest . The slowest time qualifier was almost 7 seconds faster than Makhloufi winning the first .",
