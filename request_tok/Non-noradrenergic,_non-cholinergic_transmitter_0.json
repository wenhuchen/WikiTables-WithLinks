  "/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate": "Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) is a complex organic chemical that provides energy to drive many processes in living cells , e.g . muscle contraction , nerve impulse propagation , and chemical synthesis . Found in all forms of life , ATP is often referred to as the molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer . When consumed in metabolic processes , it converts either to adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) or to adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) . Other processes regenerate ATP so that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day . It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA , and is used as a coenzyme . From the perspective of biochemistry , ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate , which indicates that it consists of three components : a nitrogenous base ( adenine ) , the sugar ribose , and the triphosphate .",
  "/wiki/Peptide": "Peptides ( from Greek language \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 , pept\u00f3s digested ; derived from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd , p\u00e9ssein to digest ) are short chains of amino acids linked by peptide ( amide ) bonds . The simplest peptides are dipeptides , followed by tripeptides , tetrapeptides , etc . A polypeptide is a long , continuous , and unbranched peptide chain . Hence , peptides fall under the broad chemical classes of biological oligomers and polymers , alongside nucleic acids , oligosaccharides and polysaccharides , etc . Peptides are distinguished from proteins on the basis of size , and as an arbitrary benchmark can be understood to contain approximately 50 or fewer amino acids . Proteins consist of one or more polypeptides arranged in a biologically functional way , often bound to ligands such as coenzymes and cofactors , or to another protein or other macromolecule ( DNA , RNA , etc . ) , or to complex macromolecular assemblies . Finally , while aspects of the lab techniques applied to peptides versus polypeptides and proteins differ ( e.g. , the specifics of electrophoresis , chromatography , etc . ) , the size boundaries that distinguish peptides from polypeptides and proteins are not absolute : long peptides such as amyloid beta have been referred to as proteins , and smaller proteins like insulin have been considered peptides . Amino acids that have been incorporated into peptides are termed residues . A water molecule is released during formation of each amide bond . All peptides except cyclic peptides have an N-terminal ( amine group ) and C-terminal ( carboxyl group ) residue at the end of the peptide ( as shown for the tetrapeptide in the image ) .",

  "/wiki/Blood_vessel": "The blood vessels are the components of the circulatory system that transport blood throughout the human body . These vessels transport blood cells , nutrients , and oxygen to the tissues of the body . They also take waste and carbon dioxide away from the tissues . Blood vessels are needed to sustain life , because all of the bodys tissues rely on their functionality . There are five types of blood vessels : the arteries , which carry the blood away from the heart ; the arterioles ; the capillaries , where the exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues occurs ; the venules ; and the veins , which carry blood from the capillaries back towards the heart . The word vascular , meaning relating to the blood vessels , is derived from the Latin vas , meaning vessel . Some structures - such as cartilage , the epithelium , and the lens and cornea of the eye - do not contain blood vessels and are labeled avascular .",

  "/wiki/Vasoconstriction": "Vasoconstriction is the narrowing of the blood vessels resulting from contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels , in particular the large arteries and small arterioles . The process is the opposite of vasodilation , the widening of blood vessels . The process is particularly important in controlling hemorrhage and reducing acute blood loss . When blood vessels constrict , the flow of blood is restricted or decreased , thus retaining body heat or increasing vascular resistance . This makes the skin turn paler because less blood reaches the surface , reducing the radiation of heat . On a larger level , vasoconstriction is one mechanism by which the body regulates and maintains mean arterial pressure . Medications causing vasoconstriction , also known as vasoconstrictors , are one type of medicine used to raise blood pressure . Generalized vasoconstriction usually results in an increase in systemic blood pressure , but it may also occur in specific tissues , causing a localized reduction in blood flow . The extent of vasoconstriction may be slight or severe depending on the substance or circumstance . Many vasoconstrictors also cause pupil dilation . Medications that cause vasoconstriction include : antihistamines , decongestants , and stimulants . Severe vasoconstriction may result in symptoms of intermittent claudication .",

  "/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system": "The enteric nervous system ( ENS ) or intrinsic nervous system is one of the main divisions of the autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) and consists of a mesh-like system of neurons that governs the function of the gastrointestinal tract . It is capable of acting independently of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems , although it may be influenced by them . The ENS is also called the second brain.It is derived from neural crest cells . The enteric nervous system is capable of operating independently of the brain and spinal cord , but does rely on innervation from the autonomic nervous system via the vagus nerve and prevertebral ganglia in healthy subjects . However , studies have shown that the system is operable with a severed vagus nerve . The neurons of the enteric nervous system control the motor functions of the system , in addition to the secretion of gastrointestinal enzymes . These neurons communicate through many neurotransmitters similar to the CNS , including acetylcholine , dopamine , and serotonin . The large presence of serotonin and dopamine in the gut are key areas of research for neurogastroenterologists .",
  "/wiki/Peristalsis": "Peristalsis is a radially symmetrical contraction and relaxation of muscles that propagates in a wave down a tube , in an anterograde direction . In much of a digestive tract such as the human gastrointestinal tract , smooth muscle tissue contracts in sequence to produce a peristaltic wave , which propels a ball of food ( called a bolus while in the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract and chyme in the stomach ) along the tract . Peristaltic movement comprises relaxation of circular smooth muscles , then their contraction behind the chewed material to keep it from moving backward , then longitudinal contraction to push it forward . Earthworms use a similar mechanism to drive their locomotion , and some modern machinery imitates this design . The word comes from New Latin and is derived from the Greek peristellein , to wrap around , from peri- , around + stellein , draw in , bring together ; set in order .",
  "/wiki/5-HT": "Serotonin ( /\u02ccs\u025br\u0259\u02c8to\u028an\u026an , \u02ccs\u026a\u0259r\u0259-/ ) or 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) is a monoamine neurotransmitter . It has a popular image as a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness , though its actual biological function is complex and multifaceted , modulating cognition , reward , learning , memory , and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction . Biochemically , the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan , via the ( rate-limiting ) hydroxylation of the 5 position on the ring ( forming the intermediate 5-hydroxytryptophan ) , and then decarboxylation to produce serotonin . Serotonin is primarily found in the enteric nervous system located in the gastrointestinal tract ( GI tract ) . However , it is also produced in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , specifically in the Raphe nuclei located in the brainstem . Additionally , serotonin is stored in blood platelets and is released during agitation and vasoconstriction , where it then acts as an agonist to other platelets . Approximately 90% of the human body 's total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract , where it regulates intestinal movements . The serotonin is secreted luminally and basolaterally , which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation , which gives increased stimulation of myenteric neurons and gastrointestinal motility . The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS , where it has various functions . These include the regulation of mood , appetite , and sleep . Serotonin also has some cognitive functions , including memory and learning . Several classes of antidepressants , such as the SSRIs and the SNRIs among others , interfere with the normal reabsorption of serotonin after it is done with the transmission of the signal , therefore augmenting the neurotransmitter levels in the synapses .",
  "/wiki/Dopamine": "Dopamine ( DA , a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine ) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families . It functions both as a hormone and a neurotransmitter , and plays several important roles in the brain and body . It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA , which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys . Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals . In the brain , dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter - a chemical released by neurons ( nerve cells ) to send signals to other nerve cells . The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways , one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior . The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain , [ failed verification ] and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release . Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones . These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory . In popular culture and media , dopamine is usually seen as the main chemical of pleasure , but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confers motivational salience ; in other words , dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence ( i.e. , the desirability or aversiveness ) of an outcome , which in turn propels the organism 's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome . Outside the central nervous system , dopamine functions primarily as a local paracrine messenger . In blood vessels , it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator ( at normal concentrations ) ; in the kidneys , it increases sodium excretion and urine output ; in the pancreas , it reduces insulin production ; in the digestive system , it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa ; and in the immune system , it reduces the activity of lymphocytes .",

The sympathetic nervous system 's primary process is to stimulate the body 's fight-flight-or-freeze response . It is , however , constantly active at a basic level to maintain homeostasis homeodynamics . The sympathetic nervous system is described as being antagonistic to the parasympathetic nervous system which stimulates the body to feed and breed and to ( then ) rest-and-digest .",
  "/wiki/Kidney": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs found in vertebrates . They are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space , and in adult humans are about 11 centimetres ( 4.3 in ) in length . They receive blood from the paired renal arteries ; blood exits into the paired renal veins . Each kidney is attached to a ureter , a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder . The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney . Each human adult kidney contains around 1 million nephrons , while a mouse kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons . The kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluid compartments , fluid osmolality , acid-base balance , various electrolyte concentrations , and removal of toxins . Filtration occurs in the glomerulus : one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered . Examples of substances reabsorbed are solute-free water , sodium , bicarbonate , glucose , and amino acids . Examples of substances secreted are hydrogen , ammonium , potassium and uric acid . The kidneys also carry out functions independent of the nephron . For example , they convert a precursor of vitamin D to its active form , calcitriol ; and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin and renin .",
  "/wiki/Vasodilation": "Vasodilation is the widening of blood vessels . It results from relaxation of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls , in particular in the large veins , large arteries , and smaller arterioles . The process is the opposite of vasoconstriction , which is the narrowing of blood vessels . When blood vessels dilate , the flow of blood is increased due to a decrease in vascular resistance and increase in cardiac output [ further explanation needed ] . Therefore , dilation of arterial blood vessels ( mainly the arterioles [ citation needed ] ) decreases blood pressure . The response may be intrinsic ( due to local processes in the surrounding tissue ) or extrinsic ( due to hormones or the nervous system ) . In addition , the response may be localized to a specific organ ( depending on the metabolic needs of a particular tissue , as during strenuous exercise ) , or it may be systemic ( seen throughout the entire systemic circulation ) . Endogenous substances and drugs that cause vasodilation are termed vasodilators . Such vasoactivity is necessary for homeostasis ( keeping the body running normally ) .",

  "/wiki/Erection": "An erection ( clinically : penile erection or penile tumescence ) is a physiological phenomenon in which the penis becomes firm , engorged , and enlarged . Penile erection is the result of a complex interaction of psychological , neural , vascular , and endocrine factors , and is often associated with sexual arousal or sexual attraction , although erections can also be spontaneous . The shape , angle , and direction of an erection varies considerably in humans . Physiologically , erection is triggered by the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system , causing the levels of nitric oxide ( a vasodilator ) to rise in the trabecular arteries and smooth muscle of the penis . The arteries dilate causing the corpora cavernosa of the penis ( and to a lesser extent the corpus spongiosum ) to fill with blood ; simultaneously the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa restricting the egress and circulation of this blood . Erection subsides when parasympathetic activity reduces to baseline . As an autonomic nervous system response , an erection may result from a variety of stimuli , including sexual stimulation and sexual arousal , and is therefore not entirely under conscious control . Erections during sleep or upon waking up are known as nocturnal penile tumescence ( NPT ) . Absence of nocturnal erection is commonly used to distinguish between physical and psychological causes of erectile dysfunction and impotence . The state of a penis which is partly , but not fully , erect is sometimes known as semi-erection ( clinically : partial tumescence ) ; a penis which is not erect is typically referred to as being flaccid , or soft .",

In serous secretions , the main type of protein secreted is alpha-amylase , an enzyme that breaks down starch into maltose and glucose , whereas in mucous secretions the main protein secreted is mucin , which acts as a lubricant . In humans , between 0.5 and 1.5 litres of saliva are produced every day . The secretion of saliva ( salivation ) is mediated by parasympathetic stimulation ; acetylcholine is the active neurotransmitter and binds to muscarinic receptors in the glands , leading to increased salivation .",
  "/wiki/Cotransmitter": "Neurotransmission ( Latin : transmissio passage , crossing from transmittere send , let through ) is the process by which signaling molecules called neurotransmitters are released by the axon terminal of a neuron ( the presynaptic neuron ) , and bind to and react with the receptors on the dendrites of another neuron ( the postsynaptic neuron ) a short distance away . A similar process occurs in retrograde neurotransmission , where the dendrites of the postsynaptic neuron release retrograde neurotransmitters ( e.g. , endocannabinoids ; synthesized in response to a rise in intracellular calcium levels ) that signal through receptors that are located on the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron , mainly at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses . Neurotransmission is regulated by several different factors : the availability and rate-of-synthesis of the neurotransmitter , the release of that neurotransmitter , the baseline activity of the postsynaptic cell , the number of available postsynaptic receptors for the neurotransmitter to bind to , and the subsequent removal or deactivation of the neurotransmitter by enzymes or presynaptic reuptake . In response to a threshold action potential or graded electrical potential , a neurotransmitter is released at the presynaptic terminal . The released neurotransmitter may then move across the synapse to be detected by and bind with receptors in the postsynaptic neuron . Binding of neurotransmitters may influence the postsynaptic neuron in either an inhibitory or excitatory way . The binding of neurotransmitters to receptors in the postsynaptic neuron can trigger either short term changes , such as changes in the membrane potential called postsynaptic potentials , or longer term changes by the activation of signaling cascades . Neurons form complex biological neural networks through which nerve impulses ( action potentials ) travel . Neurons do not touch each other ( except in the case of an electrical synapse through a gap junction ) ; instead , neurons interact at close contact points called synapses . A neuron transports its information by way of an action potential . When the nerve impulse arrives at the synapse , it may cause the release of neurotransmitters , which influence another ( postsynaptic ) neuron . The postsynaptic neuron may receive inputs from many additional neurons , both excitatory and inhibitory .",
  "/wiki/Bronchodilation": "A bronchodilator or broncholytic ( although the latter occasionally includes secretory inhibition as well ) is a substance that dilates the bronchi and bronchioles , decreasing resistance in the respiratory airway and increasing airflow to the lungs . Bronchodilators may be endogenous ( originating naturally within the body ) , or they may be medications administered for the treatment of breathing difficulties . They are most useful in obstructive lung diseases , of which asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most common conditions . Although this remains somewhat controversial , they might be useful in bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis . They are often prescribed but of unproven significance in restrictive lung diseases . Bronchodilators are either short-acting or long-acting . Short-acting medications provide quick or rescue relief from acute bronchoconstriction . Long-acting bronchodilators help to control and prevent symptoms .

  "/wiki/Sympathetic_ganglia": "The sympathetic ganglia , or autonomic ganglia , are the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system . Ganglia are 20,000 to 30,000 afferent and efferent nerve cell bodies that run along on either side of the spinal cord . Afferent nerve cell bodies bring information from the body to the brain and spinal cord , while efferent nerve cell bodies bring information from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body . The cell bodies create long sympathetic chains that are on either side of the spinal cord . They also form para- or pre-vertebral gangalia of gross anatomy . The efferent nerve cell bodies bring information from the brain to the body regarding perceptions of danger . This perception of danger can instigate the fight-or-flight response associated with the sympathetic nervous system . The fight-or-flight response is adaptive when there is a real and present danger which can be avoided or diminished through increased sympathetic activity . Sympathetic activity could be increased heart rate , dilated pupils , or sweaty palms , for example . The fight-or-flight response is maladaptive when the danger is imagined , prolonged , or when it lasts after the threat is over . When the intensity or duration of the response is excessive , the individual may meet criteria for a variety of psychological disorders . Neuroblastoma tumors can arise from the sympathetic ganglia tissue .",

  "/wiki/Myelinated": "Myelin is a lipid-rich ( fatty ) substance that surrounds nerve cell axons ( the nervous system 's wires ) to insulate them and increase the rate at which electrical impulses ( called action potentials ) are passed along the axon . The myelinated axon can be likened to an electrical wire ( the axon ) with insulating material ( myelin ) around it . However , unlike the plastic covering on an electrical wire , myelin does not form a single long sheath over the entire length of the axon . Rather , each myelin sheath insulates the axon over a single long section and , in general , each axon comprises multiple long myelinated sections separated from each other by short gaps called nodes of Ranvier . Myelin is formed in the central nervous system ( CNS ) by glial cells called oligodendrocytes and in the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) by glial cells called Schwann cells . In the CNS , axons carry electrical signals from one nerve cell body to another . In the PNS , axons carry signals to muscles and glands or from sensory organs such as the skin . Each myelin sheath is formed by the concentric wrapping of an oligodendrocyte ( CNS ) or Schwann cell ( PNS ) process ( a limb-like extension from the cell body ) around the axon . Myelin reduces the capacitance of the axonal membrane . On a molecular level , in the internodes it increases the distance between extracellular and intracellular ions , reducing the accumulation of charges . The discontinuous structure of the myelin sheath results in saltatory conduction , whereby the action potential jumps from one node of Ranvier , over a long myelinated stretch of the axon called the internode , before recharging at the next node of Ranvier , and so on , until it reaches the axon terminal . Nodes of Ranvier are the short ( c. 1 micron ) unmyelinated regions of the axon between adjacent long ( c. 0.2 mm - > 1 mm ) myelinated internodes .",

  "/wiki/Vascular_permeability": "Vascular permeability , often in the form of capillary permeability or microvascular permeability , characterizes the capacity of a blood vessel wall to allow for the flow of small molecules ( drugs , nutrients , water , ions ) or even whole cells ( lymphocytes on their way to the site of inflammation ) in and out of the vessel . Blood vessel walls are lined by a single layer of endothelial cells . The gaps between endothelial cells ( cell junctions ) are strictly regulated depending on the type and physiological state of the tissue . There are several techniques to measure vascular permeability to certain molecules . For instance , the cannulation of a single microvessel with a micropipette , the microvessel is perfused with a certain pressure , occluded downstream and then the velocity of some cells will be related to the permeability . Another technique uses multiphoton fluorescence intravital microscopy through which the flow is related to fluorescence intensity and the permeability is estimated from the Patlak transformation of the intensity data In cancer research , the study of permeability of the microvasculature that surrounds tumours is of great interest as the vascular wall is a barrier of large molecules into the tumours , the vessels control the microenvironment which affect tumour progression and changes to the permeability may indicate vascular damage with drugs . An example of increased vascular permeability is in the initial lesion of periodontal disease , in which the gingival plexus becomes engorged and dilated , allowing large numbers of neutrophils to extravasate and appear within the junctional epithelium and underlying connective tissue .",
  "/wiki/Neurogenic_inflammation": "Neurogenic inflammation is inflammation arising from the local release by afferent neurons of inflammatory mediators such as Substance P , Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide ( CGRP ) , neurokinin A ( NKA ) , and endothelin-3 ( ET-3 ) . In such neurons , release of these pro-inflammatory mediators is thought to be triggered by the activation of ion channels that are the principal detectors of noxious enviornmental stimuli . In particular , the heat/capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and the irritant/wasabi receptor TRPA1 . TRPA1 channels stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) may also cause acute neurogenic inflammation . Once released , these neuropeptides induce the release of histamine from adjacent mast cells . In turn , histamine evokes the release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide ; thus , a bidirectional link between histamine and neuropeptides in neurogenic inflammation is established . Neurogenic inflammation appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including migraine , psoriasis , asthma , vasomotor rhinitis , fibromyalgia , eczema , rosacea , dystonia , and multiple chemical sensitivity . In migraine , stimulation of the trigeminal nerve causes neurogenic inflammation via release of neuropeptides including Substance P , nitric oxide , vasoactive intestinal polypeptide , 5-HT , Neurokinin A and CGRP . leading to a sterile neurogenic inflammation ."
