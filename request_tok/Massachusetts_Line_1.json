  "/wiki/Siege_of_Boston": "The Siege of Boston ( April 19 , 1775 - March 17 , 1776 ) was the opening phase of the American Revolutionary War . New England militiamen prevented the movement by land of the British Army , which was garrisoned in what was then the peninsular city of Boston , Massachusetts Bay . Both sides had to deal with resource supply and personnel issues over the course of the siege . British resupply and reinforcement activities were limited to sea access . After eleven months of the siege , the British abandoned Boston by sailing to Nova Scotia . The siege began on April 19 after the Battles of Lexington and Concord , when the militia from surrounding Massachusetts communities blocked land access to Boston . The Continental Congress formed the Continental Army from the militia , with George Washington as its Commander in Chief . In June 1775 , the British seized Bunker and Breed 's Hills , from which the Continentals were preparing to bombard the city , but their casualties were heavy and their gains were insufficient to break the Continental Army 's hold on land access to Boston . The Americans laid siege to the British-occupied city . Military actions during the remainder of the siege were limited to occasional raids , minor skirmishes , and sniper fire . In November 1775 , George Washington sent the 25-year-old bookseller-turned-soldier Henry Knox to bring to Boston the heavy artillery that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga . In a technically complex and demanding operation , Knox brought many cannons to the Boston area by January 1776 .",
  "/wiki/Fortification_of_Dorchester_Heights": "The Fortification of Dorchester Heights was a decisive action early in the American Revolutionary War that precipitated the end of the siege of Boston and the withdrawal of British troops from that city . On March 4 , 1776 , troops from the Continental Army under George Washington 's command occupied Dorchester Heights , a series of low hills with a commanding view of Boston and its harbor , and mounted powerful cannons there threatening the city and the Navy ships in the harbor . General William Howe , commander of the British forces occupying Boston , planned an attack to dislodge them . However , after a snowstorm prevented its execution , Howe chose to withdraw . British forces , accompanied by Loyalists who had fled to the city during the siege , evacuated the city on March 17 and sailed to Halifax , Nova Scotia .",
  "/wiki/New_York_and_New_Jersey_campaign": "The New York and New Jersey campaign was a series of battles in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 for control of the Port of New York and the state of New Jersey during the American Revolutionary War between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington . Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York , but overextended his reach into New Jersey , and ended the active campaign season in January 1777 with only a few outposts near the city . The British held New York harbor for the rest of the war , using it as a base for expeditions against other targets . First landing unopposed on Staten Island on July 3 , 1776 , Howe assembled an army composed of elements that had been withdrawn from Boston in March following their failure to hold that city , combined with additional British troops , as well as Hessian troops hired from several German principalities . Washington had New England soldiers as well as regiments from states as far south as Virginia . Landing on Long Island in August , Howe defeated Washington in the largest battle of the war , but the Continental Army was able to make an orderly retreat to Manhattan under cover of darkness and fog . Washington suffered a series of further defeats in Manhattan , with the exception of the skirmish at Harlem Heights , and eventually withdrew to White Plains , New York . At that point Howe returned to Manhattan to capture forces Washington had left in the north of the island . Washington and much of his army then crossed the Hudson River into New Jersey , and retreated all the way across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania , shrinking due to ending enlistment periods , desertions , and poor morale . Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December , establishing a chain of outposts from New York to Burlington , New Jersey . Washington , in a tremendous boost to American morale , launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison after crossing the icy Delaware River , prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York , while Washington established his winter camp at Morristown . During the remaining winter months , both sides skirmished frequently as the British sought forage and provisions .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Trenton": "The Battle of Trenton was a small but pivotal battle during the American Revolutionary War , which took place on the morning of December 26 , 1776 , in Trenton , New Jersey . After General George Washington 's crossing of the Delaware River north of Trenton the previous night , Washington led the main body of the Continental Army against Hessian auxiliaries garrisoned at Trenton . After a brief battle , almost two-thirds of the Hessian force was captured , with negligible losses to the Americans . The battle significantly boosted the Continental Army 's waning morale , and inspired re-enlistments . The Continental Army had previously suffered several defeats in New York and had been forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania . Morale in the army was low ; to end the year on a positive note , George Washington - Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army - devised a plan to cross the Delaware River on the night of December 25-26 and surround the Hessians ' garrison . Because the river was icy and the weather severe , the crossing proved dangerous . Two detachments were unable to cross the river , leaving Washington with only 2,400 men under his command in the assault , 3,000 fewer than planned . The army marched 9 miles ( 14.5 km ) south to Trenton . The Hessians had lowered their guard , thinking they were safe from the Americans ' army , and had no long-distance outposts or patrols . Washington 's forces caught them off guard , and after a short but fierce resistance , most of the Hessians surrendered and were captured , with just over a third escaping across Assunpink Creek . Despite the battle 's small numbers , the U.S. victory inspired rebels in the colonies .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Princeton": "The Battle of Princeton was a battle of the American Revolutionary War , fought near Princeton , New Jersey on January 3 , 1777 , and ending in a small victory for the Colonials . General Lord Cornwallis had left 1,400 British troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton . Following a surprise attack at Trenton early in the morning of December 26 , 1776 , General George Washington of the Continental Army decided to attack the British in New Jersey before entering the winter quarters . On December 30 , he crossed the Delaware River back into New Jersey . His troops followed on January 3 , 1777 . Washington advanced to Princeton by a back road , where he pushed back a smaller British force but had to retreat before Cornwallis arrived with reinforcements . The battles of Trenton and Princeton were a boost to the morale of the patriot cause , leading many recruits to join the Continental Army in the spring . After defeating the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26 , 1776 , Washington withdrew back to Pennsylvania . He subsequently decided to attack the British forces before going into winter quarters . On December 29 , he led his army back into Trenton . On the night of January 2 , 1777 , Washington repulsed a British attack at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek . That night , he evacuated his position , circled around General Cornwallis ' army , and went to attack the British garrison at Princeton .",

  "/wiki/Invasion_of_Canada_(1775)": "The Invasion of Quebec in 1775 was the first major military initiative by the newly formed Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War . The objective of the campaign was to gain military control of the British Province of Quebec ( part of modern-day Canada ) , and convince French-speaking Canadien to join the revolution on the side of the Thirteen Colonies . One expedition left Fort Ticonderoga under Richard Montgomery , besieged and captured Fort St. Johns , and very nearly captured British General Guy Carleton when taking Montreal . The other expedition left Cambridge , Massachusetts , under Benedict Arnold , and traveled with great difficulty through the wilderness of Maine to Quebec City . The two forces joined there , but they were defeated at the Battle of Quebec in December 1775 . Montgomery 's expedition set out from Fort Ticonderoga in late August , and in mid-September began besieging Fort St. Johns , the main defensive point south of Montreal . After the fort was captured in November , Carleton abandoned Montreal , fleeing to Quebec City , and Montgomery took control of Montreal before heading for Quebec with an army much reduced in size by expiring enlistments . There he joined Arnold , who had left Cambridge in early September on an arduous trek through the wilderness that left his surviving troops starving and lacking in many supplies and equipment . These forces joined before Quebec City in December , and they assaulted the city in a snowstorm on the last day of the year . The battle was a disastrous defeat for the Continental Army ; Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded , while the city 's defenders suffered few casualties . Arnold then conducted an ineffectual siege on the city , during which successful propaganda campaigns boosted Loyalist sentiments , and General David Wooster 's blunt administration of Montreal served to annoy both supporters and detractors of the Americans . The British sent several thousand troops , including General John Burgoyne and Hessian allies , to reinforce those in the province in May 1776 .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Island": "The Battle of Long Island , also known as the Battle of Brooklyn and the Battle of Brooklyn Heights , was a military action of the American Revolutionary War fought on August 27 , 1776 , at the western edge of Long Island in the present-day borough of Brooklyn , New York . The British defeated the Americans and gained control of the strategically important Port of New York , which they held for the rest of the war . It was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared its independence on July 4 , 1776 , and in troop deployment and combat , it was the largest battle of the entire war . After defeating the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17 , 1776 , commander-in-chief George Washington relocated the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York , located at the southern end of Manhattan Island . Washington understood that the city 's harbor would provide an excellent base for the Royal Navy , so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack . In July , the British , under the command of General William Howe , landed a few miles across the harbor on the sparsely populated Staten Island , where they were reinforced by a fleet of ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half , bringing their total force to 32,000 troops . Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows , and accordingly moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan , believing that it would be the first target . On August 22 , the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County , across the Narrows from Staten Island and more than a dozen miles south from the established East River crossings to Manhattan . After five days of waiting , the British attacked U.S. defenses on the Guan Heights . Unknown to the Americans , however , Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after . The Americans panicked , resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and capture , although a stand by 400 Maryland and Delaware troops prevented a more substantial portion of the army from being lost . The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights .",

Planned in partial secrecy , Washington led a column of Continental Army troops across the icy Delaware River in a logistically challenging and dangerous operation . Other planned crossings in support of the operation were either called off or ineffective , but this did not prevent Washington from surprising and defeating the troops of Johann Rall quartered in Trenton . The army crossed the river back to Pennsylvania , this time laden with prisoners and military stores taken as a result of the battle . Washington 's army then crossed the river a third time at the end of the year , under conditions made more difficult by the uncertain thickness of the ice on the river . They defeated British reinforcements under Lord Cornwallis at Trenton on January 2 , 1777 , and defeated his rear guard at Princeton on January 3 , before retreating to winter quarters in Morristown , New Jersey .
