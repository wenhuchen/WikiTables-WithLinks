  "/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_(historic)": "The Conservative Party of Canada has gone by a variety of names over the years since Canadian Confederation . Initially known as the Liberal-Conservative Party , it dropped Liberal from its name in 1873 , although many of its candidates continued to use this name . As a result of World War I and the Conscription Crisis of 1917 , the party joined with pro-conscription Liberals to become the Unionist Party , led by Robert Borden from 1917 to 1920 , and then the National Liberal and Conservative Party until 1922 . It then reverted to Liberal-Conservative Party until 1938 , when it became simply the National Conservative Party . It ran in the 1940 election as National Government even though it was in opposition . The party was almost always referred to as simply the Conservative Party or Tories .",

  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada": "The Liberal Party of Canada ( French : Parti lib\u00e9ral du Canada ) is the oldest and longest-serving political party in Canada . The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada 's history , holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result , it is sometimes referred to as Canada 's natural governing party . The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice . In the 2015 federal election , the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election , winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats , gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons . However , in the 2019 federal election , they lost their majority , winning 157 seats , but they still remained the largest party in the House .",

Prior to his political career , he was a prominent lawyer and businessman in Montreal . He later ran for the Progressive Conservatives and won in a landslide in the 1984 Canadian federal election , defeating John Turner of the Liberals and Ed Broadbent of the NDP , not only winning every single province and territory but also capturing over 50% of the vote for the first time since 1958 and increasing his party 's seats by 111 , up to 211 seats , the highest amount of seats won by any party in Canadian history . The 6.3 million votes won by Mulroney also remained a record until the Liberals ' victory in 2015 .

He brought forth a constitutional reform , the Meech Lake Accord , in 1987 , meant to persuade the government of Quebec to endorse the 1982 constitutional amendments . It was not ratified by the provincial governments of Manitoba and Newfoundland before the June ratification deadline , and thus met its demise in 1990 . This loss led to another round of meetings in Charlottetown in 1991 and 1992 . These negotiations culminated in Mulroney introducing the Charlottetown Accord , which would create extensive changes to the constitution , including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society .

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada 's third longest-serving Prime Minister , behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald . Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer , intellectual , and activist in Quebec politics . He joined the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965 , quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson 's Parliamentary Secretary . In 1967 , he was appointed Minister of Justice . Trudeau 's outgoing personality caused a media sensation , inspiring Trudeaumania , and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968 , when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada . From the late 1960s until the early 1980s , Trudeau 's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life . After his appointment as Prime Minister , he won the 1968 , 1972 and 1974 elections , before narrowly losing in 1979 . He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards , in 1980 , and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election . Despite his personal motto , Reason before passion , his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office . Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau 's intellect and his political acumen , maintaining national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement , suppressing a Quebec terrorist crisis , fostering a pan-Canadian identity , and in achieving sweeping institutional reform , including the implementation of official bilingualism , patriation of the Constitution , and the establishment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Critics accused him of arrogance , of economic mismanagement , and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies .",
