An English major who graduated from Waseda University , one of Japan 's most prestigious , in 1935 , Motoyoshi Oda was promptly accepted into the directors ' program at Tokyo 's P.C.L . ( Photo Chemical Laboratories , a film company later incorporated into Toho Studios ) . He studied under director Kajiro Yamamoto , as did Akira Kurosawa , Ishir\u014d Honda , and Senkichi Taniguchi . When the latter two trainees were drafted into Japan 's war in China , Oda found his career accelerated . He was promoted to director in 1940 with Song of Kunya , after a relatively scant few years of training . Perhaps because of this relative lack of training , and certainly because Oda was not drafted into the army , P.C.L . and Toho kept Oda going as a maker of programmers - trivial pictures that had to be made in order to keep product flowing into the theaters , but which offered little time or room for artistic achievement . Probably his most distinguished credits are Lady From Hell ( 1949 , based on a Kurosawa script ) , Tomei Ningen a 1954 Japanese horror classic inspired by The Invisible Man , a follow-up to his earlier 1954 film Ghost Man .

  "/wiki/Science_fiction_film": "Science fiction film ( or sci-fi film ) is a genre that uses speculative , fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science , such as extraterrestrial lifeforms , alien worlds , extrasensory perception and time travel , along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft , robots , cyborgs , interstellar travel or other technologies . Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues , and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition . In many cases , tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held . The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema , when Georges Melies ' A Trip to the Moon ( 1902 ) employed trick photography effects . The next major example in the genre was the film Metropolis ( 1927 ) . From the 1930s to the 1950s , the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B movies . After Stanley Kubrick 's landmark 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) , the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously .

These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted .

Chanbara is a sub-category of jidaigeki , which equates to period drama . Jidaigeki may refer to a story set in a historical period , though not necessarily dealing with a samurai character or depicting swordplay . While earlier samurai period pieces were more dramatic rather than action-based , samurai movies produced post World War II have become more action-based , with darker and more violent characters . Post war samurai epics tended to portray psychologically or physically scarred warriors . Akira Kurosawa stylized and exaggerated death and violence in samurai epics . His samurai , and many others portrayed in film , were solitary figures , more often concerned with concealing their martial abilities , rather than showing them off . Historically , the genre is usually set during the Tokugawa era ( 1600-1868 ) . The samurai film hence often focuses on the end of an entire way of life for the samurai : many of the films deal with masterless r\u014dnin , or samurai dealing with changes to their status resulting from a changing society . Samurai films were constantly made into the early 1970s , but by then , overexposure on television , the aging of the big stars of the genre , and the continued decline of the mainstream Japanese film industry put a halt to most of the production of this genre .",

He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema . Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936 , following a brief stint as a painter . After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter , he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata ( a.k.a . Judo Saga ) . After the war , the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel ( 1948 ) , in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role , cemented the director 's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan . The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films . Rashomon , which premiered in Tokyo , became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival . The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry , which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers . Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , including a number of highly regarded ( and often adapted ) films , such as Ikiru ( 1952 ) , Seven Samurai ( 1954 ) and Yojimbo ( 1961 ) .
