Territorial reform passed by the French legislature in 2014 resulted in the merger of the Alsace administrative region with Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine to form Grand Est . Due to protests it was decided in 2019 that Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin would form the future European Collectivity of Alsace in 2021 . Alsatian is an Alemannic dialect closely related to Swabian and Swiss German , although since World War II most Alsatians primarily speak French .

The economic and cultural capital of Alsace , as well as its largest city , is Strasbourg . The city is the seat of several international organizations and bodies .",
