  "/wiki/Male": "A male ( \u2642 ) organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm . Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete , or ovum , in the process of fertilization . A male can not reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female , but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually . Most male mammals , including male humans , have a Y chromosome , which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs . Not all species share a common sex-determination system . In most animals , including humans , sex is determined genetically ; however , species such as Cymothoa exigua change sex depending on the number of females present in the vicinity .",
  "/wiki/Female": "Female ( symbol : \u2640 ) is the sex of an organism , or a part of an organism , that produces non-mobile ova ( egg cells ) . Barring rare medical conditions , most female mammals , including female humans , have two X chromosomes . Female characteristics vary between different species with some species containing more well defined female characteristics , such as the presence of pronounced mammary glands . There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages . The word female comes from the Latin femella , the diminutive form of femina , meaning woman . It is not etymologically related to the word male .",
  "/wiki/Realm": "A realm /\u02c8r\u025blm/ is a community or territory over which a sovereign rules . The term is commonly used to describe a kingdom or other monarchical or dynastic state . A realm may also be a subdivision within an empire , if it has its own monarch , e.g . the German Empire . The Old French word reaume , modern French royaume , was the word first adopted in English ; the fixed modern spelling does not appear until the beginning of the 17th century . The word supposedly derives from medieval Latin regalimen , from regalis , of or belonging to a rex ( king ) . The word rex itself is derived from the Latin verb regere , which means to rule . Thus the literal meaning of the word realm is the territory of a ruler , traditionally a monarch ( emperor , king , grand duke , prince , etc. ) . Realm is particularly used for those states whose name includes the word kingdom ( for example , the United Kingdom ) , as elegant variation , to avoid clumsy repetition of the word in a sentence ( for example , The Queen 's realm , the United Kingdom. ) . It is also useful to describe those countries whose monarchs are called something other than king or queen ; for example , the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a realm but not a kingdom , since its monarch holds the title Grand Duke rather than King . The term may commonly also be used to describe any one of the Commonwealth realms , which are kingdoms in their own right and share the same person as monarch , though they are fully independent of each other . More broadly , a realm may encompass territories that are subject to a monarch , yet are not a physical part of his or her kingdom ; for example , the Cook Islands and Niue are considered parts of the Realm of New Zealand , although they are not part of New Zealand proper .",

  "/wiki/Muslim_world": "The terms Muslim world and Islamic world commonly refer to the Islamic community ( Ummah ) , consisting of all those who adhere to the religion of Islam , or to societies where Islam is practiced . In a modern geopolitical sense , these terms refer to countries where Islam is widespread , although there are no agreed criteria for inclusion . The term Muslim-majority countries is an alternative often used for the latter sense . The history of the Muslim world spans about 1400 years and includes a variety of socio-political developments , as well as advances in the arts , science , philosophy , and technology , particularly during the Islamic Golden Age . All Muslims look for guidance to the Quran and believe in the prophetic mission of Muhammad , but disagreements on other matters have led to appearance of different religious schools and branches within Islam . In the modern era , most of the Muslim world came under influence or colonial domination of European powers . The nation states that emerged in the post-colonial era have adopted a variety of political and economic models , and they have been affected by secular and as well as religious trends . As of 2013 [ update ] , the combined GDP ( nominal ) of 49 Muslim majority countries was US $ 5.7 trillion , As of 2016 [ update ] , they contributed 8% of the world 's total . As of 2019 , 1.9 billion or about 24.4% of the world population are Muslims . By the percentage of the total population in a region considering themselves Muslim , 91% in the Middle East-North Africa ( MENA ) , 89% in Central Asia , 40% in Southeast Asia , 31% in South Asia , 30% in Sub-Saharan Africa , 25% in Asia-Oceania , around 6% in Europe , and 1% in the Americas . Most Muslims are of one of two denominations ; Sunni ( 75-90% ) and Shia . About 13% of Muslims live in Indonesia , the largest Muslim-majority country ; 31% of Muslims live in South Asia , the largest population of Muslims in the world ; 20% in the Middle East-North Africa , where it is the dominant religion ; and 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa and West Africa .",

It was ruled by the first four successive caliphs ( successors ) of Muhammad after his death in 632 CE ( AH 11 ) . These caliphs are collectively known in Sunni Islam as the Rashidun , or Rightly Guided caliphs ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062e\u064f\u0644\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0634\u0650\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e al-Khulaf\u0101\u02be ar-R\u0101\u0161id\u016bn ) . This term is not widely used in Shia Islam as Shia Muslims do not consider the rule of the first three caliphs as legitimate . The Rashidun Caliphate is characterized by a twenty-five year period of rapid military expansion , followed by a five-year period of internal strife . The Rashidun Army at its peak numbered more than 100,000 men . By the 650s , the caliphate in addition to the Arabian Peninsula had subjugated the Levant , to the Transcaucasus in the north ; North Africa from Egypt to present-day Tunisia in the west ; and the Iranian plateau to parts of Central Asia and South Asia in the east . The caliphate arose out of the death of Muhammad in 632 CE and the subsequent debate over the succession to his leadership . Abu Bakr , a close companion of Muhammad from the Banu Taym clan , was elected the first Rashidun leader and began the conquest of the Arabian Peninsula . He ruled from 632 to his death in 634 . Abu Bakr was succeeded by Umar , his appointed successor from the Banu Adi clan , who continued the conquest of Persia , eventually leading to the fall of the Sassanid Empire in 651 .

The third Caliph , Uthman ibn Affan ( r. 644-656 ) , was a member of the Umayyad clan . The family established dynastic , hereditary rule with Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan , long-time governor of Syria , who became the sixth Caliph after the end of the First Muslim Civil War in 661 . After Mu'awiyah 's death in 680 , conflicts over the succession resulted in a Second Civil War and power eventually fell into the hands of Marwan I from another branch of the clan . Syria remained the Umayyads ' main power base thereafter , and Damascus was their capital . The Umayyads continued the Muslim conquests , incorporating the Transoxiana , Sindh , the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula ( Al-Andalus ) into the Muslim world . At its greatest extent , the Umayyad Caliphate covered 11,100,000 km2 ( 4,300,000 sq mi ) and 33 million people , making it one of the largest empires in history in both area and proportion of the world 's population . The dynasty was eventually overthrown by a rebellion led by the Abbasids in 750 . Survivors of the dynasty established themselves in Cordoba which , in the form of an Emirate and then a Caliphate , became a world centre of science , medicine , philosophy and invention , ushering in the period of the Golden Age of Islam . The Umayyad caliphate ruled over a vast multiethnic and multicultural population .

It was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad 's uncle , Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib ( 566-653 CE ) , from whom the dynasty takes its name . They ruled as caliphs for most of the caliphate from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq , after having overthrown the Umayyad Caliphate in the Abbasid Revolution of 750 CE ( 132 AH ) . The Abbasid Caliphate first centred its government in Kufa , modern-day Iraq , but in 762 the caliph Al-Mansur founded the city of Baghdad , near the ancient Sasanian capital city of Ctesiphon . The Abbasid period was marked by reliance on Persian bureaucrats ( notably the Barmakid family ) for governing the territories as well as an increasing inclusion of non-Arab Muslims in the ummah ( national community ) . Persianate customs were broadly adopted by the ruling elite , and they began patronage of artists and scholars . Baghdad became a centre of science , culture , philosophy and invention in what became known as the Golden Age of Islam . Despite this initial cooperation , the Abbasids of the late 8th century had alienated both non-Arab mawali ( clients ) and Iranian bureaucrats . They were forced to cede authority over al-Andalus ( Spain ) to the Umayyads in 756 , Morocco to the Idrisid dynasty in 788 , Ifriqiya and Southern Italy to the Aghlabids in 800 , Iran to Saffarid in 861 and Egypt to the Isma'ili-Shia caliphate of the Fatimids in 969 . The political power of the caliphs was limited with the rise of the Iranian Buyids and the Seljuq Turks , who captured Baghdad in 945 and 1055 , respectively . Although Abbasid leadership over the vast Islamic empire was gradually reduced to a ceremonial religious function in much of the Caliphate , the dynasty retained control over its Mesopotamian domain . The Abbasids ' period of cultural fruition and its ( reduced ) territorial control ended in 1258 with the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols under Hulagu Khan and the execution of Al-Musta'sim .",

State constitutions limit eligibility for the thrones to male Malay Muslims of royal descent . Seven are hereditary monarchies based on agnatic primogeniture : Kedah , Kelantan , Johor , Perlis , Pahang , Selangor and Terengganu . In Perak , the throne rotates among three branches of the royal family loosely based on agnatic seniority . One state , Negeri Sembilan , is an elective monarchy ; the ruler is elected from male members of the royal family by hereditary chiefs . All rulers , except those of Perlis and of Negeri Sembilan , use the title of Sultan . The ruler of Perlis is styled the Raja , whereas the ruler of Negeri Sembilan is known as the Yang di-Pertuan Besar . Every five years or when a vacancy occurs , the rulers convene as the Conference of Rulers ( Malay : Majlis Raja-Raja ) to elect among themselves the Yang di-Pertuan Agong , the federal constitutional monarch and head of state of Malaysia . As the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected among the rulers , Malaysia , as a whole , is also an elective monarchy .",

'House of Saljuq ' ) or the Great Seljuq Empire [ note 1 ] was a high medieval Turko-Persian Sunni Muslim empire , originating from the Qiniq branch of Oghuz Turks . At its greatest extent , the Seljuk Empire controlled a vast area stretching from western Anatolia and the Levant to the Hindu Kush in the east , and from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf in the south . The Seljuk empire was founded by Tughril Beg ( 990-1063 ) and his brother Chaghri Beg ( 989-1060 ) in 1037 . From their homelands near the Aral Sea , the Seljuks advanced first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia , before eventually capturing Baghdad and conquering eastern Anatolia . Here the Seljuks won the battle of Manzikert in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire , which became one of the reasons for the first crusade ( 1095-1099 ) . From c. 1150-1250 , the Seljuk empire declined , and was invaded by the Mongols around 1260 . The Mongols divided Anatolia into emirates . Eventually one of these , the Ottoman , would conquer the rest . Seljuk gave his name to both the empire and the Seljuk dynasty . The Seljuks united the fractured political landscape of the eastern Islamic world and played a key role in the first and second crusades . Highly Persianized in culture and language , the Seljuks also played an important role in the development of the Turko-Persian tradition , even exporting Persian culture to Anatolia .",
  "/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate": "The Delhi Sultanate was an Islamic empire based in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years ( 1206-1526 ) . Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially : the Mamluk dynasty ( 1206-90 ) , the Khalji dynasty ( 1290-1320 ) , the Tughlaq dynasty ( 1320-1414 ) , the Sayyid dynasty ( 1414-51 ) , and the Lodi dynasty ( 1451-1526 ) . The sultanate is noted for being one of the few powers to repel attacks by the Mongols ( from the Chagatai Khanate ) , causing the decline of Buddhism in East India and Bengal , and enthroning one of the few female rulers in Islamic history , Razia Sultana , who reigned from 1236 to 1240 . Qutb al-Din Aibak , a former Turkic Mamluk slave of Muhammad Ghori was the first sultan of Delhi , and his Mamluk dynasty conquered large areas of northern India . Afterwards , the Khalji dynasty was also able to conquer most of central India , but both failed to conquer the whole of the Indian subcontinent . The sultanate reached the peak of its geographical reach during the Tughlaq dynasty , occupying most of the Indian subcontinent . This was followed by decline due to Hindu reconquests , states such as the Vijayanagara Empire and Mewar asserting independence , and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal Sultanate breaking off . During and in the Delhi Sultanate , there was a synthesis of Indian civilization with that of Islamic civilization , and the further integration of the Indian subcontinent with a growing world system and wider international networks spanning large parts of Afro-Eurasia , which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society , as well as the wider world . The time of their rule included the earliest forms of Indo-Islamic architecture , greater use of mechanical technology , increased growth rates in India 's population and economy , and the emergence of the Hindi-Urdu language . The Delhi Sultanate was also responsible for repelling the Mongol Empire 's potentially devastating invasions of India in the 13th and 14th centuries . The Delhi Sultanate was also responsible for large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent . In 1526 , the Sultanate was conquered and succeeded by the Mughal Empire .",

Conventional historical thesis marks c. 1400 as the founding year of the sultanate by a Malay Raja of Singapura ( King of Singapore ) , Parameswara , also known as Iskandar Shah . :245-246 At the height of the sultanate 's power in the 15th century , its capital grew into one of the most important entrep\u00f4ts of its time , with territory covering much of the Malay Peninsula , the Riau Islands and a significant portion of the northern coast of Sumatra in present-day Indonesia . As a bustling international trading port , Malacca emerged as a centre for Islamic learning and dissemination , and encouraged the development of the Malay language , literature and arts . It heralded the golden age of Malay sultanates in the archipelago , in which Classical Malay became the lingua franca of the Maritime Southeast Asia and Jawi script became the primary medium for cultural , religious and intellectual exchange . It is through these intellectual , spiritual and cultural developments , the Malaccan era witnessed the enculturation of a Malay identity , the Malayisation of the region and the subsequent formation of an Alam Melayu . In the year of 1511 , the capital of Malacca fell to the Portuguese Empire , forcing the last Sultan , Mahmud Shah ( r. 1488-1511 ) , to retreat to the further reaches of his empire , where his progeny established new ruling dynasties , Johor and Perak . The political and cultural legacy of the sultanate remains to this day . For centuries , Malacca has been held up as an exemplar of Malay-Muslim civilisation . It established systems of trade , diplomacy , and governance that persisted well into the 19th century , and introduced concepts such as daulat - a distinctly Malay notion of sovereignty - that continues to shape contemporary understanding of Malay kingship . The fall of Malacca benefited Brunei when its ports became a new entrep\u00f4t as the kingdom emerged as a new Muslim empire in the Malay Archipelago , attracting many Muslim traders who fled from the Portuguese occupation after the ruler of Brunei 's conversion to Islam .",

Aramaic , Canaanite , Hebrew ) and Arabic . Although the early forms of the name were to be found among the Pre-Arab and Pre-Islamic Semites of The Levant , Canaan , and Mesopotamia , it has since been adopted in various other , mainly but not exclusively Islamized or Arabized non-Semitic Asian languages for their ruling princes and to render kings elsewhere . It is also sometimes used in derived meanings . The female version of Malik is Malikah ( Arabic : \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 ) ( or its various spellings such as Malekeh or Melike ) , meaning queen . The name Malik was originally found among various pre-Arab and non-Muslim Semitic peoples such as the indigenous ethnic Assyrians of Iraq , Amorites , Jews , Arameans , Mandeans , Syriacs , and pre-Islamic Arabs . It has since been spread among various predominantly Muslim and non-Semitic peoples in Central Asia , the Middle East , and South Asia . Malik is also an angel in the Quran , who never smiled since the day the hellfire was created .

They primarily live in Afghanistan and Pakistan . A substantial majority of ethnic Pashtuns share Pashto - an Eastern Iranic language in the Indo-European language family - as the native language . Globally , the Pashtuns are estimated to number around 50 million , but an accurate count remains elusive due to the lack of an official census in Afghanistan since 1979 . The majority of the Pashtuns live in the region regarded as Pashtunistan , which has been split between two countries since the Durand Line border was formed after the Second Anglo-Afghan War . The Pashtuns are a significant minority group in Pakistan , where they constitute the second-largest ethnic group or about 15 percent of the population . Smaller , but still significant Pashtun diaspora communities exist in Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan , especially in the cities of Karachi and Lahore , and in the Rohilkhand region of Uttar Pradesh , India . A recent Pashtun diaspora has also developed in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf , primarily in the United Arab Emirates .

Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits .

Although the emirate recognized the suzerainty of the Abbasid Caliphate and maintained close ties with Tulunid Egypt , it was de facto independent . A group of Andalusian exiles led by Abu Hafs Umar al-Iqritishi conquered Crete sometime c. 824 or 827/828 , and established an independent Islamic state . The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos , but the reconquest was not completed and was soon reversed . Later attempts by the Byzantine Empire to recover the island failed , and for the approximately 135 years of its existence , the emirate was one of the major foes of Byzantium . Crete commanded the sea lanes of the Eastern Mediterranean and functioned as a forward base and haven for Muslim corsair fleets that ravaged the Byzantine-controlled shores of the Aegean Sea . The emirate 's internal history is less well-known , but all accounts point to considerable prosperity deriving not only from piracy but also from extensive trade and agriculture . The emirate was brought to an end by Nikephoros Phokas , who launched a huge campaign against it in 960-961 .",

  "/wiki/Samraat": "An emperor ( from Latin : imperator , via Old French : empereor ) is a monarch , and usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm . Empress , the female equivalent , may indicate an emperor 's wife ( empress consort ) , mother ( empress dowager ) , or a woman who rules in her own right ( empress regnant ) . Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings . In Europe , the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages , considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope due to the latter 's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe . The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as Emperor . Both emperors and kings are monarchs , but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles . Inasmuch as there is a strict definition of emperor , it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation . Therefore a king might be obliged to pay tribute to another ruler , or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion , but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints . However , monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts - the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the incorporation of India , though she was declared Empress of India . In Western Europe , the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the Holy Roman Emperor , whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of translatio imperii , i.e . they claimed succession to the authority of the Western Roman Emperors , thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology . Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy , by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_India": "Anatomically modern humans are thought to have arrived on the Indian subcontinent between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago . Settled life , which involves the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism , began in South Asia around 7,000 BCE ; during this period , domestication of wheat and barley , rapidly followed by that of goats , sheep , and cattle occurred . By 4,500 BCE , settled life had become more widely prevalent , and eventually evolved into the Indus Valley Civilization . Considered a cradle of civilisation , the Indus Valley civilisation , which spread and flourished in the north-western part of the Indian subcontinent from 3300 to 1300 BCE , was the first major civilisation in South Asia . A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature Harappan period , from 2600 to 1900 BCE . Indus Valley Civilisation was noted for developing new techniques in handicraft , carnelian products , seal carving , metallurgy , urban planning , baked brick houses , efficient drainage systems , water supply systems and clusters of large non-residential buildings . This civilisation collapsed at the start of the second millennium BCE and was later followed by the Iron Age Vedic Period . In early second millennium BCE persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban centres to villages . Around the same time , Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from regions further northwest in several waves of migration . The resulting Vedic period was marked by the composition of the Vedas , large collections of hymns of these tribes whose postulated religious culture , through synthesis with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent , gave rise to Hinduism . The caste system , which created a hierarchy of priests , warriors , and free peasants arose later during this period . Towards the end of the period , around 600 BCE , after the pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain , large swaths of which they deforested to pave way for agriculture , a second urbanisation took place .",

The parasol was considered a symbol of absolute , or even universal , sovereignty and consecrated kingship , and has been used by monarchies outside of India , as well . The title indicates a person who is a sovereign ruler over other princes , and not a vassal . In contrast , the Indian titles of Maharaja or Raja , Yuvraj , Rajkumar or Kumar , and Senapati , reflect a range of European equivalent meanings , from King , Crown Prince , and Prince , to Duke , Count , or Lord .

  "/wiki/Princely_state": "A princely state , also called native state , feudatory state or Indian state ( for those states on the subcontinent ) , was a vassal state under a local or indigenous or regional ruler in a subsidiary alliance with the British Raj . Though the history of the princely states of the subcontinent dates from at least the classical period of Indian history , the predominant usage of the term princely state specifically refers to a semi-sovereign principality on the Indian subcontinent during the British Raj that was not directly governed by the British , but rather by a local ruler , subject to a form of indirect rule on some matters . The imprecise doctrine of paramountcy allowed the government of British India to interfere in the internal affairs of princely states individually or collectively and issue edicts that applied to all of India when it deemed it necessary . At the time of the British withdrawal , 565 princely states were officially recognised in the Indian subcontinent , apart from thousands of zamindari estates and jagirs . In 1947 , princely states covered 40% of the area of pre-independence India and constituted 23% of its population . The most important states had their own British Political Residencies : Hyderabad , Mysore and Travancore in the South followed by Jammu and Kashmir , and Sikkim in the Himalayas , and Indore in Central India . The most prominent among those - roughly a quarter of the total - had the status of a salute state , one whose ruler was entitled to a set number of gun salutes on ceremonial occasions . The princely states varied greatly in status , size , and wealth ; the premier 21-gun salute states of Hyderabad , and Jammu and Kashmir were each over 200,000 km2 ( 77,000 sq mi ) in size . In 1941 , Hyderabad had a population of over 16 million , while Jammu and Kashmir had a population of slightly over 4 million . At the other end of the scale , the non-salute principality of Lawa covered an area of 49 km2 ( 19 sq mi ) , with a population of just below 3,000 . Some two hundred of the lesser states had an area of less than 25 km2 ( 10 sq mi ) . The era of the princely states effectively ended with Indian independence in 1947 .",

Writers such as William Henry Scott have suggested that this rank is equivalent to that of Rajah , and that different ethnic groups either used one term or the other , or used the two words interchangeably . But other writers such as Nick Joaquin have suggested that the usage of the term Rajah specifically indicates leadership of a bayan or barangay which has extensive trade relations with Muslim traders . Equivalent terms for this rank include the term Sultan among the most developed and complex Islamized principalities of Mindanao , and the term Datu as used by various polities in the Visayas and in some areas of Mindanao .",
  "/wiki/Datu": "Datu is a title which denotes the rulers ( variously described in historical accounts as chiefs , sovereign princes , and monarchs [ Notes 1 ] ) of numerous indigenous peoples throughout the Philippine archipelago . The title is still used today , especially in Mindanao , Sulu and Palawan , [ Notes 2 ] [ Notes 3 ] but it was used much more extensively in early Philippine history , particularly in the regions of Central and Southern Luzon , the Visayas [ Notes 4 ] and Mindanao . [ Notes 5 ] In early Philippine history , Datus and a small group of their close relatives formed the apex stratum of the traditional three-tier social hierarchy of lowland Philippine societies . Only a member of this birthright aristocracy ( called maginoo , nobleza , maharlika , or timagua by various early chroniclers ) could become a Datu ; members of this elite could hope to become a datu by demonstrating prowess in war and/or exceptional leadership . In large coastal polities such as those in Maynila , Tondo , Pangasinan , Cebu , Panay , Bohol , Butuan , Cotabato , Lanao , and Sulu , several datus brought their loyalty-groups , referred to as barangays or dulohan , into compact settlements which allowed greater degrees of cooperation and economic specialization . In such cases , datus of these barangays would then select the most senior or most respected among them to serve as what scholars call a paramount leader , or paramount datu . The titles used by such paramount datu changed from case to case , but some of the most prominent examples were : Sultan in the most Islamized areas of Mindanao ; Lakan among the Tagalog people ; Thimuay among the Subanen people ; Rajah in polities which traded extensively with Indonesia and Malaysia ; or simply Datu in some areas of Mindanao and the Visayas . Together with Lakan ( Luzon ) , Apo in Central and Northern Luzon , Sultan and Rajah , they are titles used for native royalty . Depending upon the prestige of the sovereign royal family , the title of Datu could be roughly comparable to sovereign princes or European dukes . Proofs of Filipino royalty and nobility ( Dug\u00f3ng Bugh\u00e1w ) can be demonstrated only by clear blood descent from ancient native royal blood , and in some cases adoption into a royal family .

  "/wiki/Emperor": "An emperor ( from Latin : imperator , via Old French : empereor ) is a monarch , and usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm . Empress , the female equivalent , may indicate an emperor 's wife ( empress consort ) , mother ( empress dowager ) , or a woman who rules in her own right ( empress regnant ) . Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings . In Europe , the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages , considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope due to the latter 's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe . The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as Emperor . Both emperors and kings are monarchs , but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles . Inasmuch as there is a strict definition of emperor , it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation . Therefore a king might be obliged to pay tribute to another ruler , or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion , but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints . However , monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts - the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the incorporation of India , though she was declared Empress of India . In Western Europe , the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the Holy Roman Emperor , whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of translatio imperii , i.e . they claimed succession to the authority of the Western Roman Emperors , thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology . Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy , by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states .",
  "/wiki/Great_King": "Great king and the equivalent in many languages is a semantic title for historical titles of monarchs , suggesting an elevated status among the host of kings and princes . This title is most usually associated with the shahanshah ( shah of shahs , i.e . king of kings , indeed translated in Greek basileus t\u014dn basile\u014dn , later adopted by the Byzantine emperors ) of Persia under the Achaemenid dynasty whose vast empire in Asia lasted for 200 years up to the year 330 BC , and later adopted by successors of the Achaemenid Empire whose monarchial names were also succeeded by the great . In comparison , high king was used by ancient rulers in Great Britain and Ireland , as well as Greece . In the 2nd millennium BCE Near East , there was a tradition of reciprocally using such addresses between powers , as a way of diplomatically recognizing each other as an equal . Only the kings of countries who were not subject to any other king and powerful enough to draw the respect from their adversaries were allowed to use the title of great king . Those were the kings of Egypt , Yamhad , Hatti , Babylonia , Mitanni ( until its demise in the 14th century ) , Assyria ( only after the demise of Mitanni ) , and for a brief time Myceneans . Great kings referred to each other as brothers and often established close relationships by means of marriages and frequent gift exchanges . Letters exchanged between these rulers , several of which has been recovered especially in Amarna and Hittite archives , provide details of this diplomacy . The case of maharaja ( great raja , great king and prince , in Sanskrit and Hindi ) on the Indian subcontinent , originally reserved for the regional hegemon such as the Gupta , is an example how such a lofty style of this or an alternative model can get caught in a cycle of devalution by title inflation as ever more , mostly less powerful , rulers adopt the style . This is often followed by the emergence of one or more new , more exclusive and prestigious styles , as in this case maharajadhiraja ( great king of kings ) .

Though most commonly associated with Iran ( historically known as Persia in the West ) , especially the Achaemenid and Sasanian Empires , the title was originally introduced during the Middle Assyrian Empire by king Tukulti-Ninurta I ( reigned 1233-1197 BC ) and was subsequently used in a number of different kingdoms and empires , including the aforementioned Persia , various Hellenic kingdoms , Armenia , Georgia and Ethiopia . The title is commonly seen as equivalent to that of Emperor , both titles outranking that of king in prestige , stemming from the medieval Byzantine Emperors who saw the Shahanshahs of the Sasanian Empire as their equals . The last reigning monarchs to use the title of Shahanshah , those of the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran ( 1925-1979 ) , also equated the title with Emperor .

Akbar , for instance , was half-Persian ( his mother was of Persian origin ) , Jahangir was half-Rajput and quarter-Persian , and Shah Jahan was three-quarters Rajput .

Reduced subsequently , especially during the East India Company rule in India , to the region in and around Old Delhi , the empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . Although the Mughal empire was created and sustained by military warfare , it did not vigorously suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule , but rather equalized and placated them through new administrative practices , and diverse ruling elites , leading to more efficient , centralised , and standardized rule . The base of the empire 's collective wealth was agricultural taxes , instituted by the third Mughal emperor , Akbar . These taxes , which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator , were paid in the well-regulated silver currency , and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets . The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India 's economic expansion . Burgeoning European presence in the Indian ocean , and its increasing demand for Indian raw- and finished products , created still greater wealth in the Mughal courts . There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite , resulting in greater patronage of painting , literary forms , textiles , and architecture , especially during the reign of Shah Jahan . Among the Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Asia are : Agra Fort , Fatehpur Sikri , Red Fort , Humayun 's Tomb , Lahore Fort and the Taj Mahal , which is described as , The jewel of Muslim art in India , and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world 's heritage .",
  "/wiki/Satrap": "Satraps ( /\u02c8s\u00e6tr\u0259p/ ) were the governors of the provinces of the ancient Median and Achaemenid Empires and in several of their successors , such as in the Sasanian Empire and the Hellenistic empires . The satrap served as viceroy to the king , though with considerable autonomy ; and the word also came to suggest tyranny , or ostentatious splendour . The word satrap is also often used metaphorically in modern literature to refer to world leaders or governors who are heavily influenced by larger world superpowers or hegemonies and act as their surrogates .

  "/wiki/Khagan": "Khagan or Qaghan [ note 1 ] is a title of imperial rank in the Turkic , Mongolic and some other languages , equal to the status of emperor and someone who rules a khaganate ( empire ) . The female equivalent is Khatun . It may also be translated as Khan of Khans , equivalent to King of Kings . In Bulgarian , the title became known as Kan ( as in the Nominalia of the Bulgarian Kans ) , while in modern Turkic , the title became Khaan with the ' g ' sound becoming almost silent or non-existent ( i.e . a very light voiceless velar fricative ) ; the \u011f in modern Turkish Ka\u011fan is also silent . Since the division of the Mongol Empire , emperors of the Yuan dynasty held the title of Khagan and their successors in Mongolia continued to have the title . Ka\u011fan and Kaan are common Turkish names in Turkey . The common western rendering as Great Khan ( or Grand Khan ) , notably in the case of the Mongol Empire , is translation of Yekhe Khagan ( Great Emperor or \u0418\u0445 \u0425\u0430\u0430\u043d ) .",
  "/wiki/Khanum": "Khanum , Khanom or Khanoum , ( Kazakh : Hanym , ( Arabic : \u0647\u0627\u0646\u0645 , ( Uzbek : Xonim , Azerbaijani : Xan\u0131m , Turkish : Han\u0131m , Persian : \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645 , Hindi : \u0916\u093c\u093e\u0928\u0941\u092e , Urdu : \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645 , Albanian : Han\u00ebm , Bengali : \u0996\u09be\u0981\u09a8\u09ae , \u0996\u09be\u09a8\u09ae , Sylheti : \ua808\ua823\ua818\ua81d ) is a female royal and aristocratic title derived through an originally Central Asian title , and was later used in the Middle East and South Asia . It is the feminine equivalent of the title Khan for a sovereign or military ruler , widely used by medieval nomadic Mongol tribes living north and northwest of modern-day China . Khan is also seen as a title in the Xianbei confederation for their chief between 283 and 289 . The Rourans were the first people who used the titles Khagan and Khan for their emperors , replacing the Chanyu of the Xiongnu , whom Grousset and others assume to be Turkic . In Turkish , it is spelled Han\u0131m . The title of Han\u0131mefendi is a combination of the words Khanum ( tr . Han\u0131m ) and efendi . Today , the term is used as a way to respectfully address women of any social rank . Khanum is the eastern equivalent of madam , or more colloquially , ma'am . In South Asia , particularly in Afghanistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Sindh , Baluchistan and North India , Khanum has been adapted for use as an honorific for Muslim women of high social status .

  "/wiki/Empire": "An empire is a sovereign state functioning as an aggregate of nations or people that are ruled over by an emperor or another kind of monarch . The territory and population of an empire is commonly of greater extent than the one of a kingdom . An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories , such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire , or of territories far remote from the homeland , such as a colonial empire . Aside from the more formal usage , the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise ( e.g . a transnational corporation ) , a political organisation controlled by a single individual ( a political boss ) , or a group ( political bosses ) . The word empire is associated with such other words as imperialism , colonialism , and globalization . Empire is often used to describe a displeasure to overpowering situations . An imperial political structure can be established and maintained in two ways : ( i ) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or ( ii ) as a coercive , hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power . The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control , yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons . The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control , but avails military forces for further expansion . Territorial empires ( e.g . the Mongol Empire and Median Empire ) tend to be contiguous areas .",
  "/wiki/Mongolian_language": "Mongolian [ note 1 ] is the official language of Mongolia and both the most widely spoken and best-known member of the Mongolic language family . The number of speakers across all its dialects may be 5.2 million , including the vast majority of the residents of Mongolia and many of the Mongolian residents of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the People 's Republic of China . In Mongolia , the Khalkha dialect , written in Cyrillic ( and at times in Latin for social networking ) , is predominant , while in Inner Mongolia , the language is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script . In the discussion of grammar to follow , the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian ( i.e. , the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in grammar as taught in schools ) , but much of what is to be said is also valid for vernacular ( spoken ) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects , especially Chakhar . Some classify several other Mongolic languages like Buryat and Oirat as dialects of Mongolian , but this classification is not in line with the current international standard . Mongolian has vowel harmony and a complex syllabic structure for a Mongolic language that allows clusters of up to three consonants syllable-finally . It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains . While there is a basic word order , subject-object-predicate , ordering among noun phrases is relatively free , so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases . There are five voices . Verbs are marked for voice , aspect , tense , and epistemic modality/evidentiality . In sentence linking , a special role is played by converbs . Modern Mongolian evolved from Middle Mongol , the language spoken in the Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries .",
  "/wiki/Turkic_languages": "The Turkic languages are a language family of at least 35 documented languages , spoken by the Turkic peoples of Eurasia from Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , Central Asia and West Asia all the way to North Asia ( particularly in Siberia ) and East Asia . The Turkic languages originated in a region of East Asia spanning Western China to Mongolia , where Proto-Turkic is thought to have been spoken , from where they expanded to Central Asia and farther west during the first millennium . Turkic languages are spoken as a native language by some 170 million people , and the total number of Turkic speakers , including second language speakers , is over 200 million . The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish , spoken mainly in Anatolia and the Balkans ; its native speakers account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers . Characteristic features such as vowel harmony , agglutination , and lack of grammatical gender , are universal within the Turkic family . There is also a high degree of mutual intelligibility among the various Oghuz languages , which include Turkish , Azerbaijani , Turkmen , Qashqai , Gagauz , Balkan Gagauz Turkish and Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar . Although methods of classification vary , the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches : Oghur , the only surviving member of which is Chuvash , and Common Turkic , which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch . Turkic languages show some similarities with the Mongolic , Tungusic , Koreanic and Japonic languages . These similarities led some linguists to propose an Altaic language family , though this proposal is widely rejected by historical linguists . Apparent similarities with the Uralic languages even caused these families to be regarded as one for a long time under the Ural-Altaic hypothesis . However , there has not been sufficient evidence to conclude the existence of either of these macrofamilies , the shared characteristics between the languages being attributed presently to extensive prehistoric language contact .",
  "/wiki/Rus'_Khaganate": "The Rus ' Khaganate , also Ruthenia Kaganate is the name applied by some modern historians to a hypothetical polity postulated to exist during a poorly documented period in the history of Eastern Europe , roughly the late 8th and early-to-mid-9th centuries AD . It was suggested that the Rus ' Khaganate was a state , or a cluster of city-states , set up by a people called Rus ' , described in all contemporary sources as being Norsemen , somewhere in what is today European Russia , as a chronological predecessor to the Rurik Dynasty and Kievan Rus ' . The region 's population at that time was composed of Slavic , Turkic , Baltic , Finnic , Hungarian and Norse peoples . The region was also a place of operations for Varangians , eastern Scandinavian adventurers , merchants , and pirates . In sparse contemporaneous sources , the leader or leaders of Rus people at this time were referred to by the Old Turkic title Khagan , hence the suggested name of their polity . This period is thought to be the times of the genesis of a distinct Rus ' ethnos , which gave rise to Kievan Rus ' and later states from which modern Russia , Belarus , and Ukraine evolved .",

It first appears among the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks as a variant of khagan ( sovereign , emperor ) [ c ] and implied a subordinate ruler . In the Seljuk Empire it was the highest noble title , ranking above malik ( king ) and emir . In the Mongol Empire it signified the ruler of a horde ( ulus ) , while the ruler of all the Mongols was the khagan or great khan . The title subsequently declined in importance . In Safavid Persia it was the title of a provincial governor , and in Mughal India it was a high noble rank restricted to courtiers . After the downfall of the Mughals it was used promiscuously and became a surname . Khan and its female forms occur in many personal names , generally without any nobiliary of political relevance , although it remains a common part of noble names as well .",

  "/wiki/Pharaoh": "Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty ( c. 3150 BCE ) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE , although the actual term Pharaoh was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until Merneptah , c. 1200 BCE . In the early dynasty , ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to three titles , the Horus , the Sedge and Bee ( nswt-bjtj ) name , and the Two Ladies ( nbtj ) name . The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added . In Egyptian society , religion was central to everyday life . One of the roles of the pharaoh was as an intermediary between the gods and the people . The pharaoh thus deputised for the gods ; his role was both as civil and religious administrator . He owned all of the land in Egypt , enacted laws , collected taxes , and defended Egypt from invaders as the commander-in-chief of the army . Religiously , the pharaoh officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples . He was responsible for maintaining Maat ( m\ua723\ua725t ) , or cosmic order , balance , and justice , and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat , such as to obtain resources . During the early days prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt , the Deshret or the Red Crown , was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt , while the Hedjet , the White Crown , was worn by the kings of the kingdom of Upper Egypt . After the unification of both kingdoms into one united Egypt , the Pschent , the combination of both the red and white crowns was the official crown of kings . With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties like the Khat , Nemes , Atef , Hemhem crown , and Khepresh .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_Egypt": "Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa , concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River , situated in the place that is now the country Egypt . Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC ( according to conventional Egyptian chronology ) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes ( often identified with Narmer ) . The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms , separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods : the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age , the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age . Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom , ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Near East , after which it entered a period of slow decline . During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers , including the Hyksos , the Libyans , the Nubians , the Assyrians , the Achaemenid Persians , and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great . The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom , formed in the aftermath of Alexander 's death , ruled Egypt until 30 BC , when , under Cleopatra , it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province . The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture . The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops , which supported a more dense population , and social development and culture . With resources to spare , the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions , the early development of an independent writing system , the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects , trade with surrounding regions , and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance . Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes , religious leaders , and administrators under the control of a pharaoh , who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs . The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying , surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids , temples , and obelisks ; a system of mathematics , a practical and effective system of medicine , irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques , the first known planked boats , Egyptian faience and glass technology , new forms of literature , and the earliest known peace treaty , made with the Hittites . Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy ."
