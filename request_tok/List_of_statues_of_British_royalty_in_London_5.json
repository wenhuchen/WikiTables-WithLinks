  "/wiki/Richard_I_of_England": "Richard I ( 8 September 1157 - 6 April 1199 ) was King of England from 1189 until his death . He was the second king of the House of Plantagenet . He also ruled as Duke of Normandy , Aquitaine and Gascony , Lord of Cyprus , Count of Poitiers , Anjou , Maine , and Nantes , and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period . He was the third of five sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine and seemed unlikely to become king , but all of his brothers except the youngest , John , predeceased their father . Richard was known as Richard C\u0153ur de Lion or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior . He was also known in Occitan as : Oc e No ( English : Yes and No ) , because of his reputation for terseness . By the age of 16 , Richard had taken command of his own army , putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father . Richard was a central Christian commander during the Third Crusade , leading the campaign after the departure of Philip II of France and achieving considerable victories against his Muslim counterpart , Saladin , although he did not retake Jerusalem from Saladin . Richard spoke both French and Occitan . He was born in England , where he spent his childhood ; before becoming king , however , he lived most of his adult life in the Duchy of Aquitaine , in the southwest of France . Following his accession , he spent very little time , perhaps as little as six months , in England . Most of his life as king was spent on Crusade , in captivity , or actively defending his lands in France .",
  "/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster": "The Palace of Westminster serves as the meeting place for both the House of Commons and the House of Lords , the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants , the Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster , in central London , England . Its name , which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey , may refer to either of two structures : the Old Palace , a medieval building-complex destroyed by fire in 1834 , or its replacement , the New Palace that stands today . The palace is owned by the monarch in right of the Crown and , for ceremonial purposes , retains its original status as a royal residence . Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the Speaker of the House of Commons and to the Lord Speaker . The first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th century , and Westminster became the primary residence of the Kings of England until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512 . After that , it served as the home of the Parliament of England , which had met there since the 13th century , and also as the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice , based in and around Westminster Hall . In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament , and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall , the Cloisters of St Stephen 's , the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft , and the Jewel Tower . In the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace , the architect Charles Barry won with a design for new buildings in the Gothic Revival style , specifically inspired by the English Perpendicular Gothic style of the 14th-16th centuries . The remains of the Old Palace ( except the detached Jewel Tower ) were incorporated into its much larger replacement , which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of 112,476 m2 ( 1,210,680 sq ft ) . Part of the New Palace 's area of 3.24 hectares ( 8 acres ) was reclaimed from the River Thames , which is the setting of its nearly 300-metre long ( 980 ft ) fa\u00e7ade , called the River Front . Augustus Pugin , a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style , assisted Barry and designed the interior of the Palace .",

  "/wiki/John_of_England": "John ( 24 December 1166 - 19 October 1216 ) was King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216 . He was the third king of the House of Plantagenet . He lost the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France , resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian dynasty during the 13th century . The baronial revolt at the end of John 's reign led to the sealing of Magna Carta , a document sometimes considered an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom . John was the youngest of the four surviving sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine . He was nicknamed John Lackland because he was not expected to inherit significant lands . He became Henry 's favourite child following the failed revolt of 1173-74 by his brothers Henry the Young King , Richard , and Geoffrey against the King . John was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent . The war between Henry II and his eldest sons ended with the deaths of Henry the Young King and Geoffrey . John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against the royal administrators of his brother , King Richard , whilst Richard was participating in the Third Crusade , but he was proclaimed king after Richard died in 1199 . He came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John 's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200 . When war with France broke out again in 1202 , John achieved early victories , but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman , Breton , and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204 .",

  "/wiki/Henry_III_of_England": "Henry III ( 1 October 1207 - 16 November 1272 ) , also known as Henry of Winchester , was King of England , Lord of Ireland , and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death . He was the fourth king of the House of Plantagenet . The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame , Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons ' War . Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry 's forces , led by William Marshal , defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217 . Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225 , which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons . His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches , who re-established royal authority after the war . In 1230 , the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father , but the invasion was a debacle . A revolt led by William Marshal 's son , Richard Marshal , broke out in 1232 , ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church . Following the revolt , Henry ruled England personally , rather than governing through senior ministers . He travelled less than previous monarchs , investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles . He married Eleanor of Provence , with whom he had five children . Henry was known for his piety , holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities ; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor , whom he adopted as his patron saint .",

  "/wiki/Edward_I_of_England": "Edward I ( 17/18 June 1239 - 7 July 1307 ) , also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots ( Latin : Malleus Scotorum ) , was King of England from 1272 to 1307 . He was the fifth king of the House of Plantagenet . Before his accession to the throne , he was commonly referred to as Lord Edward . The first son of Henry III , Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father 's reign , which included an outright rebellion by the English barons . In 1259 , he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement , supporting the Provisions of Oxford . After reconciliation with his father , however , he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict , known as the Second Barons ' War . After the Battle of Lewes , Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons , but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 . Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and , with England pacified , Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land . He was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died . Making a slow return , he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey . Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law . Through an extensive legal inquiry , he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties , while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law .",
  "/wiki/Edward_III_of_England": "Edward III ( 13 November 1312 - 21 June 1377 ) was king of England and Lord of Ireland from January 1327 until his death . He was the seventh king of the House of Plantagenet . He is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father , Edward II . Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe . His long reign of 50 years was the second-longest in medieval England ( after that of his great-grandfather Henry III ) and saw vital developments in legislation and government , in particular the evolution of the English Parliament , as well as the ravages of the Black Death . Edward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was deposed by his mother , Isabella of France , and her lover Roger Mortimer . At age seventeen he led a successful coup d'\u00e9tat against Mortimer , the de facto ruler of the country , and began his personal reign . After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 . This started what became known as the Hundred Years ' War . Following some initial setbacks , this first phase of the war went exceptionally well for England ; victories at Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny , in which England made territorial gains , and Edward renounced his claim to the French throne . This phase would become known as the Edwardian War . Edward 's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife , largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health ."
