During the Early Middle Ages , he united the majority of western and central Europe . He was the first recognised emperor to rule from western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier . The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded is called the Carolingian Empire . He was later canonised by Antipope Paschal III . Charlemagne was the eldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon , born before their canonical marriage . He became king in 768 following his father 's death , initially as co-ruler with his brother Carloman I. Carloman 's sudden death in December 771 under unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne the sole ruler of the Frankish Kingdom . He continued his father 's policy towards the papacy and became its protector , removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain . He campaigned against the Saxons to his east , Christianising them upon penalty of death and leading to events such as the Massacre of Verden . He reached the height of his power in 800 when he was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day at Old St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome . Charlemagne has been called the Father of Europe ( Pater Europae ) , as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the classical era of the Roman Empire and united parts of Europe that had never been under Frankish or Roman rule . His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance , a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church .",

  "/wiki/John_Vanbrugh": "Sir John Vanbrugh ( /\u02c8v\u00e6nbr\u0259/ ; 24 January 1664 ( baptised ) - 26 March 1726 ) was an English architect , dramatist and herald , perhaps best known as the designer of Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard . He wrote two argumentative and outspoken Restoration comedies , The Relapse ( 1696 ) and The Provoked Wife ( 1697 ) , which have become enduring stage favourites but originally occasioned much controversy . He was knighted in 1714 . Vanbrugh was in many senses a radical throughout his life . As a young man and a committed Whig , he was part of the scheme to overthrow James II and put William III on the throne . He was imprisoned by the French as a political prisoner . In his career as a playwright , he offended many sections of Restoration and 18th century society , not only by the sexual explicitness of his plays , but also by their messages in defence of women 's rights in marriage . He was attacked on both counts , and was one of the prime targets of Jeremy Collier 's Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage . In his architectural career , he created what came to be known as English Baroque . His architectural work was as bold and daring as his early political activism and marriage-themed plays , and jarred conservative opinions on the subject .",

He was one of the architects of the policy of appeasement of Adolf Hitler in 1936-38 , working closely with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain . However , after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 he was one of those who pushed for a new policy of attempting to deter further German aggression by promising to go to war to defend Poland . On Chamberlain 's resignation early in May 1940 , Halifax effectively declined the position of Prime Minister as he felt that Churchill would be a more suitable war leader ( his membership of the House of Lords was given as the official reason ) . A few weeks later , with the Allies facing apparently catastrophic defeat and British forces falling back to Dunkirk , Halifax favoured approaching Italy to see if acceptable peace terms could be negotiated . He was overruled by Churchill after a series of stormy meetings of the War Cabinet . From 1941 to 1946 , he served as British Ambassador in Washington .",

The Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions ."
