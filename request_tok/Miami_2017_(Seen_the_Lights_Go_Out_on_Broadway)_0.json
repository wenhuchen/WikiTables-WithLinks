  "/wiki/Songs_in_the_Attic": "Songs in the Attic is the first live album by Billy Joel , released in 1981 . At the time of its release , it was the first widely available appearance of music from his first album , Cold Spring Harbor , originally released in 1971 . In the liner notes , Joel writes that Songs in the Attic introduced his earlier work to fans who had come to know his work after The Stranger . In that earlier work , most of the instruments were played by session musicians while Joel himself sang and played piano , keyboards , and harmonica . But by the late 1970s , Joel had a fairly consistent touring/recording band and wanted to showcase his songs as played by his band . The single-releases included : Say Goodbye to Hollywood and She 's Got a Way , which made the top 25 , and You 're My Home . In Japan , Los Angelenos was also available in 1981 . A series of promotional music videos were filmed . Though the concert filming may have been staged for the occasion , the audio versions are nonetheless different from the live recordings featuring on the live album . A total of five promo videos were filmed : four of them recorded at Sparks and one in a recording studio . At least two of them were not released as worldwide official singles . Everybody Loves You Now ( not a single ) directed by Steve Cohen ( live at Sparks ) ; You 're My Home directed by Steve Cohen ( live at Sparks ) ; Los Angelenos ( not a single , though a Japanese 7 vinyl was in existence ) directed by Steve Cohen ( live at Sparks ) ; Say Goodbye to Hollywood directed by Steve Cohen ( live at Sparks ) ; She 's Got a Way live in a studio , also a different version from the live album .",

  "/wiki/The_Stranger_(album)": "The Stranger is the fifth studio album by American singer Billy Joel , released in September 1977 by Columbia Records . It was the first of Joel 's albums to be produced by Phil Ramone , with whom he would go on to work for all of his albums up until his 1986 album The Bridge . The Stranger was released a year following Joel 's previous studio effort , Turnstiles , which had sold modestly and peaked low on the US charts , prompting Columbia to consider dropping Joel if his next release did not sell well . Joel wanted the album to feature his newly-formed touring band that had formed during the production of Turnstiles , which consisted of drummer Liberty DeVitto , bass player Doug Stegmeyer and saxophonist Richie Cannata . Seeking out a new producer , he first turned to veteran Beatles producer George Martin before coming across and settling on Ramone , whose name he had seen on albums by other artists such as Paul Simon . Recording took place across the span of three weeks , with DeVitto , Stegmeyer and Cannata being featured in addition to other studio musicians filling in as guitarists on various songs . Spending six weeks at No . 2 on the US Billboard 200 , The Stranger is considered Joel 's critical and commercial breakthrough . Four singles were released in the US , all of which became top-40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 charts , including Just the Way You Are ( # 3 ) , Movin ' Out ( Anthony 's Song ) , She 's Always a Woman ( both # 17 ) , and Only the Good Die Young ( # 24 ) . Other songs , such as Scenes from an Italian Restaurant and Vienna , have become staples of his career and are frequently performed in his live shows . The album won two awards at the 1978 Grammy Awards , winning Record of the Year as well as Song of the Year for Just the Way You Are . It remains his best-selling non-compilation album to date , and surpassed Bridge Over Troubled Water to become Columbia 's best-selling album release , with more than 10 million units sold worldwide .",
