Dix was a highly successful amateur athlete , setting a state record in the 100 m and trying out for the US Olympic Team at the age of eighteen . He joined Florida State University and in his first year he broke the 100 m American junior record and won at the NCAA Outdoor Championships . After a fourth-place finish at the 2005 US Championships , Dix continued with his collegiate success , setting an NCAA record of 19.69 seconds in the 200 m and coming within one hundredth of the 100 m record . He completed a 100 m , 200 m , and 4\u00d7100 meter relay sweep at the 2007 NCAA Outdoor Championships , the first to do so since John Carlos in 1969 . He closed his amateur career in 2008 : another NCAA 200 m title made him the third most decorated track athlete in NCAA history , and he won gold and silver at the 2008 US Olympic Trials . Dix turned professional in mid-2008 , signing a multimillion-dollar contract with Nike . He reached the Olympic finals in the 100 and 200 m , and won two bronze medals ; the only American track athlete to win two individual medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics .

In 2011 he was both the 100 and 200 m American champion and won silver medals in the events at the 2011 World Championships . An injury at the 2012 Olympic trials meant he missed a second Olympic appearance .",
