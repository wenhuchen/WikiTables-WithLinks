  "intro": "The 2013 season is Santos Futebol Clube's hundredth first season in existence and the club's fifty-fourth consecutive season in the top flight of Brazilian football. Santos reached the Campeonato Paulista Finals for fifth consecutive season, but failed to win their fourth consecutive title as they lost by 2-3 on aggregate for their biggest rival, Corinthians. On 25 May 2013, Santos announced that they had sold Neymar to Barcelona for a fee of \u20ac 57 million. A week later, the club sacked the head coach Muricy Ramalho due to the discontent of the crowd and the club's directors with his results. For his place, Claudinei Oliveira assumed as caretaker. As part of Neymar's sold to Barcelona, Santos played in the Joan Gamper Torphy against them and suffered their third worst defeat in history, losing by 8-0. In the Copa do Brasil, Santos were eliminated in the Round of 16, losing 1-2 on aggregate score to Gr\u00eamio. On 30 August, Claudinei Oliveira was promoted to head coach after 3 months as caretaker."
