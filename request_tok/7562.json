With a population of 468,158 , Gda\u0144sk is the capital and largest city of the Pomeranian Voivodeship and one of the most prominent cities within the cultural and geographical region of Kashubia . It is Poland 's principal seaport and the centre of the country 's fourth-largest metropolitan area . The city is situated on the southern edge of Gda\u0144sk Bay on the Baltic Sea , in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia , the resort town of Sopot , and suburban communities ; these form a metropolitan area called the Tricity ( Tr\u00f3jmiasto ) , with a population approaching 1.4 million . Gda\u0144sk lies at the mouth of the Mot\u0142awa River , connected to the Leniwka , a branch in the delta of the nearby Vistula River , which drains 60 percent of Poland and connects Gda\u0144sk with the Polish capital , Warsaw . Together with the nearby port of Gdynia , Gda\u0144sk is also a notable industrial centre . The city 's history is complex , with periods of Polish , Prussian and German rule , and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a free city state . In the early-modern age , Gda\u0144sk was a royal city of Poland . It was considered the wealthiest and the largest city of Poland , before the 18th century rapid growth of Warsaw . In the late Middle Ages it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town and , in the 14th and 15th centuries , a member of the Hanseatic League . In the interwar period , owing to its multi-ethnic make-up and history , Gda\u0144sk lay in a disputed region between Poland and Germany , which became known as the Polish Corridor . The city 's ambiguous political status was exploited , furthering tension between the two countries , which would ultimately culminate in the Invasion of Poland and the first clash of the Second World War just outside the city limits , followed by the flight and expulsion of the majority of the previous population in 1945 .",

Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .",

  "/wiki/History_of_German": "The history of the German language as separate from common West Germanic begins in the Early Middle Ages with the High German consonant shift . Old High German , Middle High German and Early New High German span the duration of the Holy Roman Empire . The 19th and 20th centuries saw the rise of Standard German and a decrease of dialectal variety . The 20th century brought around the German catastrophe . After World War I , the use of German was suppressed and discouraged due to the anti-German sentiment , but nevertheless it did not inflict any lasting damage to its Sprachraum nor its lingua franca status in some areas . However , after World War II , territorial changes implemented by the Allies practically removed the German language from large parts of Central and Eastern Europe that were inhabited by German-speaking populations beginning in the 12th century . It contributed to moribundness and extinction of some local dialects like Silesian German , High Prussian or East Pomeranian dialects . It also damaged the language 's status in Central-Western and Central-Southern Europe , where anti-German sentiment became even greater than before the war .",

  "/wiki/Oudegracht": "The Oudegracht , or old canal , runs through the center of Utrecht , the Netherlands . It starts in the southeast of the city .

Parts of the Oudegracht follow the original flow of the river Rhine , but there is some disagreement on what parts . The northern part is most likely an early canal ( app . 1000 ) connecting the Rhine section to the river Vecht . The southern part was started in 1122 , after the water level of the Rhine in Utrecht dropped because of the new dam at Wijk bij Duurstede . The ground excavated was used to raise the sides of the canal , to reduce the chance of flooding . When the city 's system of locks was finished in 1275 the water level was constant , enabling the creation of permanently dry cellars and new quays at water level , hence the typical wharfs ( Dutch : werven ) below street level .
