  "/wiki/B_Division_(New_York_City_Subway)": "The New York City Subway 's B Division consists of the lines that operate with lettered services ( A , B , C , D , E , F , G , J , L , M , N , Q , R , W , and Z ) , as well as the Franklin Avenue and Rockaway Park Shuttles . These lines and services were operated by the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) and city-owned Independent Subway System ( IND ) before the 1940 city takeover of the BMT . B Division rolling stock is wider , longer , and heavier than those of the A Division , measuring 10 or 9.75 ft ( 3,048 or 2,972 mm ) by 60 or 75 ft ( 18.29 or 22.86 m ) . The B Division is broken down into two subdivisions , B1 ( BMT ) and B2 ( IND ) , for chaining purposes .

  "/wiki/Independent_Subway_System": "The Independent Subway System ( IND or ISS ) , formerly known as the Independent City-Owned Subway System ( ICOS ) or the Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad , was a rapid transit rail system in New York City that is now part of the New York City Subway . It was first constructed as the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan in 1932 . One of three rail networks that became part of the modern New York City subway , the IND was intended to be fully owned and operated by the municipal government , in contrast to the privately operated or jointly funded Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) and Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) companies . It was merged with these two networks in 1940 . The original IND service lines are the modern subway 's A , B , C , D , E , F , G and M services . In addition , the BMT 's N , Q and R now run partly on IND trackage . The Rockaway Park Shuttle supplements the A service . For operational purposes , the IND and BMT lines and services are referred to jointly as the B Division .",
  "/wiki/Second_Avenue_Subway": "The Second Avenue Subway ( internally referred to as the IND Second Avenue Line by the MTA and abbreviated to SAS ) is a New York City Subway line that runs under Second Avenue on the East Side of Manhattan . The first phase of this new line , with three new stations on Manhattan 's Upper East Side , opened on January 1 , 2017 . The full Second Avenue Line , if and when it is funded , will be built in three more phases to eventually connect Harlem-125th Street in Harlem to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan . The proposed full line would be 8.5 miles ( 13.7 km ) and 16 stations long , serve a projected 560,000 daily riders , and cost more than $ 17 billion . The line was originally proposed in 1920 as part of a massive expansion of what would become the Independent Subway System ( IND ) . In anticipation of the Second Avenue Subway being built to replace them , parallel elevated lines along Second Avenue and Third Avenue were demolished in 1942 and 1955 , respectively , despite several factors causing plans for the Second Avenue Subway to be cancelled . Construction on the line finally began in 1972 as part of the Program for Action , but was halted in 1975 because of the city 's fiscal crisis , leaving only a few short segments of tunnels completed . Work on the line restarted in April 2007 following the development of a financially secure construction plan . The first phase of the line , consisting of the 96th Street , 86th Street and 72nd Street stations , as well as two miles ( 3.2 km ) of tunnel , cost $ 4.45 billion . A 1.5-mile ( 2.4 km ) , $ 6 billion second phase from 96th to 125th Streets is in planning and is expected to open by 2027-2029 . Phase 1 is served by the Q train at all times , weekend and evening M trains , and limited rush-hour N and R trains . Phase 2 will extend the line 's northern terminus from 96th Street to Harlem-125th Street , and both the Q and limited N services will be extended to 125th Street .",
  "/wiki/Manhattan": "Manhattan ( /m\u00e6n\u02c8h\u00e6t\u0259n , m\u0259n-/ ) , often referred to by residents of the New York City area as the City , is the most densely populated of the five boroughs of New York City , and coextensive with the County of New York , one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York . Manhattan serves as the city 's economic and administrative center , cultural identifier , and historical birthplace . The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island , bounded by the Hudson , East , and Harlem rivers ; as well as several small adjacent islands . Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill , a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland , that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River . Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components , each aligned with the borough 's long axis : Lower , Midtown , and Upper Manhattan . Manhattan has been described as the cultural , financial , media , and entertainment capital of the world , and the borough hosts the United Nations Headquarters . Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan , New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world , and Manhattan is home to the world 's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization : the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ . Many multinational media conglomerates are based in Manhattan , and the borough has been the setting for numerous books , films , and television shows . Manhattan real estate has since become among the most expensive in the world , with the value of Manhattan Island , including real estate , estimated to exceed US $ 3 trillion in 2013 ; median residential property sale prices in Manhattan approximated US $ 1,600 per square foot ( $ 17,000/m2 ) as of 2018 , with Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commanding the highest retail rents in the world , at US $ 3,000 per square foot ( $ 32,000/m2 ) per year in 2017 . Manhattan traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan ; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626 . Manhattan is historically documented to have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626 for 60 guilders , which equals roughly $ 1059 in current terms . The territory and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother , the Duke of York .",

  "/wiki/Brooklyn": "Brooklyn ( /\u02c8br\u028akl\u026an/ ) is a borough of New York City , coterminous with Kings County , located in the U.S. state of New York , the most populous county in the state , and the second-most densely populated county in the United States . It is New York City 's most populous borough , with an estimated 2,504,700 residents in 2010 . Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen , it shares a land border with the borough of Queens at the western end of Long Island . Brooklyn has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan across the East River , and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge connects it with Staten Island . With a land area of 70.82 square miles ( 183.4 km2 ) and water area of 26 square miles ( 67 km2 ) , Kings County is New York state 's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area , though it is the second-largest among the city 's five boroughs . If each borough were ranked as a city , Brooklyn would rank as the third-most populous in the U.S. , after Los Angeles and Chicago . Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city ( and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution ) until January 1 , 1898 , when , after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s , according to the new Municipal Charter of Greater New York , Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities , boroughs , and counties to form the modern City of New York , surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs . The borough continues , however , to maintain a distinct culture . Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves . Brooklyn 's official motto , displayed on the Borough seal and flag , is Eendraght Maeckt Maght , which translates from early modern Dutch as Unity makes strength . In the first decades of the 21st century , Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as an avant-garde destination for hipsters , with concomitant gentrification , dramatic house price increases and a decrease in housing affordability .

With two stations , it is the shortest regular service in the system by number of stops , running about 2,402 feet ( 732 m ) in 90 seconds . The shuttle is used by over 100,000 passengers every day , and by up to 10,200 passengers per hour during rush hours . The 42nd Street Shuttle was constructed and operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) , and is currently part of the A Division of New York City Transit . The tracks that it uses opened in 1904 as part of the first subway in the city . The original subway line ran north from City Hall on what is now the IRT Lexington Avenue Line to 42nd Street , from where it turned west to run across 42nd Street . Then , at Broadway , the line turned north to 145th Street on what is now the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line . This operation continued until 1918 , when construction on the Lexington Avenue Line north of 42nd Street , and on the Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line south of 42nd Street was completed . One trunk would run via the new Lexington Avenue Line down Park Avenue , and the other trunk would run via the new Seventh Avenue Line up Broadway . The section in the middle , via 42nd Street , was converted into shuttle operation .",

It is the largest borough geographically and is adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn , at the western end of Long Island . To its east is Nassau County . Queens also shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx . The borough of Queens is the second-largest in population , the first being Brooklyn ; with an estimated population of 2,278,906 residents in 2018 , approximately 47.5 percent of them foreign-born . Queens County also is the second most populous county in the U.S. state of New York , behind Brooklyn , which is coterminous with Kings County . Queens is the fourth most densely populated county among New York City 's boroughs , as well as in the United States . If each of New York City 's boroughs were an independent city , Queens would be the nation 's fourth most populous , after Los Angeles , Chicago , and Brooklyn . Queens is one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the United States , as well as the most diverse among highly populated counties and the most linguistically diverse place on Earth . Queens was established in 1683 as one of the original 12 counties of New York . The settlement was presumably named for the English queen Catherine of Braganza ( 1638-1705 ) . From 1683 until 1899 , the County of Queens included what is now Nassau County .",

The line ran from City Hall , up the Lexington Avenue Line , across 42nd Street , and up Seventh Avenue and Broadway , before splitting into the Broadway Branch and the Lenox Avenue Line . The second portion of the line , that south of 42nd Street , was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts , which were signed between the IRT , the New York Municipal Railway ( a subsidiary of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ) , and the City of New York . Among the various subway lines that were to be constructed as part of the contracts , the West Side Line was to be extended south along Seventh Avenue to serve Manhattan 's West Side . This extension extended service to the end of Lower Manhattan and into Brooklyn , relieving crowding on the East Side Line , while opening up service to new areas . The Pennsylvania Railroad 's new hub in Manhattan , Penn Station , could now be accessed by the subway . Additionally , Manhattan 's West Side was rebuilt with the arrival of the line .
