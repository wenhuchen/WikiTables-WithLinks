  "/wiki/Edward_Jenner": "Edward Jenner , FRS FRCPE ( 17 May 1749 - 26 January 1823 ) was an English physician who was a contributor to development of the smallpox vaccine . The practice of vaccination was popularized by Jenner , and since then has been used ubiquitously to prevent several diseases . The terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae ( smallpox of the cow ) , the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox . He used it in 1798 in the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox , in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox . Jenner is often called a pioneer of immunization . Using a method valid in immunology before the discovery of germ theory , his work saved many lives . In Jenner 's time , smallpox killed around 10% of the British population , with the number as high as 20% in towns and cities where infection spread more easily . In 1821 , he was appointed physician extraordinary to King George IV , and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace . A member of the Royal Society , in the field of zoology he was the first person to describe the brood parasitism of the common cuckoo . In 2002 , Jenner was named in the BBC 's list of the 100 Greatest Britons .",

He was also known for the Black Formula , a translation of the Pignet formula to British measurements . He was born in Delting Shetland in 1913 , educated at Forfar Academy , and studied medicine at the Bute Medical School , University of St Andrews , graduating with MB ChB in 1933 . He conducted research into water loss and dehydration , first at Oxford University , and then at the University of Manchester , where he became professor of medicine in 1959 . In 1974 he became the first chief scientist at the Department of Health and Social Security of the UK government . From 1977-1983 he was president of the Royal College of Physicians . He also served as the president of the British Medical Association and took an uncompromising stand against the apartheid regime in South Africa . In the 1970s Black was asked by the Labour government of the UK to chair an expert committee to investigate health inequalities . The report produced by this committee , popularly known as The Black Report was published in 1980 . Although unpopular with the then Conservative government , it has had a major impact on knowledge on the subject of health inequality since that time , and was published by Penguin Books as Inequalities in Health : The Black Report and the Health Divide in 1982 .

  "/wiki/James_II_of_England": "James II and VII ( 14 October 1633O.S . - 16 September 1701 ) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII , from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 . He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England , Scotland and Ireland ; his reign is now remembered primarily for struggles over religious tolerance . However , it also involved the principles of absolutism and divine right of kings and his deposition ended a century of political and civil strife by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown . James inherited the thrones of England , Ireland and Scotland from his elder brother Charles II with widespread support in all three countries , largely based on the principle of divine right or birth . Tolerance for his personal Catholicism did not apply to it in general and when the English and Scottish Parliaments refused to pass his measures , James attempted to impose them by decree ; it was a political principle , rather than a religious one , that ultimately led to his removal . In June 1688 , two events turned dissent into a crisis ; the first on 10 June was the birth of James 's son and heir James Francis Edward , threatening to create a Roman Catholic dynasty and excluding his Anglican daughter Mary and her Protestant husband William of Orange . The second was the prosecution of the Seven Bishops for seditious libel ; this was viewed as an assault on the Church of England and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed his political authority in England . Anti-Catholic riots in England and Scotland now made it seem only his removal as monarch could prevent a civil war . Leading members of the English political class invited William of Orange to assume the English throne ; after he landed in Brixham on 5 November 1688 , James 's army deserted , and he went into exile in France on 23 December . In February 1689 , a special Convention Parliament held that the king had vacated the English throne and installed William and Mary as joint monarchs , establishing the principle that sovereignty derived from Parliament , not birth . James landed in Ireland on 14 March 1689 in an attempt to recover his kingdoms , but despite a simultaneous rising in Scotland , in April a Scottish Convention followed that of England by finding that James had forfeited the throne and offered it to William and Mary .",

He became a great authority on kidney diseases and published a comprehensive paper on urinary deposits in 1844 . He was also notable for his work in related sciences , especially the medical uses of electricity and electrochemistry . From 1836 , he lectured at Guy 's Hospital , a well-known teaching hospital in London and now part of King 's College London , and published a popular textbook on science for medical students called Elements of Natural Philosophy . Having developed an interest in chemistry while still a child , largely through self-study , Bird was far enough advanced to deliver lectures to his fellow pupils at school . He later applied this knowledge to medicine and did much research on the chemistry of urine and of kidney stones . In 1842 , he was the first to describe oxaluria , a condition which leads to the formation of a particular kind of stone . Bird , who was a member of the London Electrical Society , was innovative in the field of the medical use of electricity , designing much of his own equipment . In his time , electrical treatment had acquired a bad name in the medical profession through its widespread use by quack practitioners . Bird made efforts to oppose this quackery , and was instrumental in bringing medical electrotherapy into the mainstream . He was quick to adopt new instruments of all kinds ; he invented a new variant of the Daniell cell in 1837 and made important discoveries in electrometallurgy with it .

Kidney disease usually causes a loss of kidney function to some degree and can result in kidney failure , the complete loss of kidney function . Kidney failure is known as the end-stage of kidney disease , where dialysis or a kidney transplant is the only treatment option .

Thus electrochemistry deals with the interaction between electrical energy and chemical change .

Beginning with A Treatise of Human Nature ( 1739-40 ) , Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature . Hume argued against the existence of innate ideas , positing that all human knowledge derives solely from experience . This places him with Francis Bacon , Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , and George Berkeley , as a British Empiricist . Hume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality can not be justified rationally ; instead , they result from custom and mental habit . We never actually perceive that one event causes another , but only experience the constant conjunction of events . This problem of induction means that to draw any causal inferences from past experience it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past , a presupposition which can not itself be grounded in prior experience . An opponent of philosophical rationalists , Hume held that passions rather than reason govern human behaviour , famously proclaiming that Reason is , and ought only to be the slave of the passions . Hume was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle . He maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena , and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the is-ought problem , or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a normative conclusion of what ought to be done . Hume also denied that humans have an actual conception of the self , positing that we experience only a bundle of sensations , and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions . Hume 's compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom .",
