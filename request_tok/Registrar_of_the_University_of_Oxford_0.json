  "/wiki/Mary_I_of_England": "Mary I ( 18 February 1516 - 17 November 1558 ) , also known as Mary Tudor , was the queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 until her death . She is best known for her vigorous attempt to reverse the English Reformation , which had begun during the reign of her father , Henry VIII . She restored to the Church some of the property taken from it in the previous two reigns . She was not able to legislate to force those who , at that time , held property which had been plundered from the Catholic Church and the monasteries . During her five-year reign , Mary had over 280 religious dissenters burned at the stake in the Marian persecutions , which led to her denunciation as Bloody Mary by her Protestant opponents . Mary was the only child of Henry VIII by his first wife , Catherine of Aragon , to survive to adulthood . Her younger half-brother Edward VI ( son of Henry and Jane Seymour ) succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine . When Edward became mortally ill in 1553 , he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he supposed , correctly , that she would reverse the Protestant reforms that had begun during his reign . Upon his death , leading politicians proclaimed Lady Jane Grey as queen . Mary speedily assembled a force in East Anglia and deposed Jane , who was ultimately beheaded .

Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn , his second wife , who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth 's birth . Anne 's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled , and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate . Her half-brother , Edward VI , ruled until his death in 1553 , bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters , the Roman Catholic Mary and the younger Elizabeth , in spite of statute law to the contrary . Edward 's will was set aside and Mary became queen , deposing Lady Jane Grey . During Mary 's reign , Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels . In 1558 upon Mary 's death , Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel . She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers , led by William Cecil , 1st Baron Burghley . One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church , of which she became the Supreme Governor . This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England .

It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England . The White Tower , which gives the entire castle its name , was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression , inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite . The castle was used as a prison from 1100 ( Ranulf Flambard ) until 1952 ( Kray twins ) , although that was not its primary purpose . A grand palace early in its history , it served as a royal residence . As a whole , the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat . There were several phases of expansion , mainly under kings Richard I , Henry III , and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries . The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site . The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history . It was besieged several times , and controlling it has been important to controlling the country . The Tower has served variously as an armoury , a treasury , a menagerie , the home of the Royal Mint , a public record office , and the home of the Crown Jewels of England .",

Edward 's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion . An expensive war with Scotland , at first successful , ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and Boulogne-sur-Mer in exchange for peace . The transformation of the Church of England into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward , who took great interest in religious matters . Although his father , Henry VIII , had severed the link between the Church and Rome , Henry VIII had never permitted the renunciation of Catholic doctrine or ceremony . It was during Edward 's reign that Protestantism was established for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of clerical celibacy and the Mass , and the imposition of compulsory services in English . In February 1553 , at age 15 , Edward fell ill .

Along with Thomas Cromwell , he supported the principle of Royal Supremacy , in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm . During Cranmer 's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury , he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed Church of England . Under Henry 's rule , Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church , due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers . However , he succeeded in publishing the first officially authorised vernacular service , the Exhortation and Litany . When Edward came to the throne , Cranmer was able to promote major reforms . He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the Book of Common Prayer , a complete liturgy for the English Church . With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge , he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the Eucharist , clerical celibacy , the role of images in places of worship , and the veneration of saints . Cranmer promulgated the new doctrines through the Prayer Book , the Homilies and other publications .

  "/wiki/Master_in_Chancery": "The Court of Chancery was a court of equity in England and Wales that followed a set of loose rules to avoid the slow pace of change and possible harshness ( or inequity ) of the common law . The Chancery had jurisdiction over all matters of equity , including trusts , land law , the estates of lunatics and the guardianship of infants . Its initial role was somewhat different : as an extension of the Lord Chancellor 's role as Keeper of the King 's Conscience , the Court was an administrative body primarily concerned with conscientious law . Thus the Court of Chancery had a far greater remit than the common law courts , whose decisions it had the jurisdiction to overrule for much of its existence , and was far more flexible . Until the 19th century , the Court of Chancery could apply a far wider range of remedies than common law courts , such as specific performance and injunctions , and had some power to grant damages in special circumstances . With the shift of the Exchequer of Pleas towards a common law court and loss of its equitable jurisdiction by the Administration of Justice Act 1841 , the Chancery became the only national equitable body in the English legal system . Academics estimate that the Court of Chancery formally split from and became independent of the curia regis in the mid-14th century , at which time it consisted of the Lord Chancellor and his personal staff , the Chancery . Initially an administrative body with some judicial duties , the Chancery experienced an explosive growth in its work during the 15th century , particularly under the House of York , which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body . From the time of Elizabeth I onwards the Court was severely criticised for its slow pace , large backlogs , and high costs . Those problems persisted until its dissolution , despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms , particularly during the 19th century . Attempts at fusing the Chancery with the common law courts began in the 1850s , and finally succeeded with the 1873 and 1875 Supreme Court of Judicature Acts , which dissolved the Chancery and created a new unified High Court of Justice , with the Chancery Division - one of three divisions of the High Court - succeeding the Court of Chancery as an equitable body . For much of its existence the Court was formally led by the Lord Chancellor , assisted by the judges of the common law courts .",

  "/wiki/List_of_founding_Fellows,_Scholars_and_Commissioners_of_Jesus_College,_Oxford": "Jesus College , Oxford , the first Protestant college at the University of Oxford , was founded by Elizabeth I in 1571 at the instigation of a Welsh clergyman , Hugh Price . The royal charter issued by Elizabeth appointed a Principal and various Fellows , Scholars and Commissioners : the Fellows to educate the Scholars and to run the college , under the overall direction of the Principal ; and the Commissioners to draw up statutes for the governance of the college , its officers and servants , and the management of the college property . The college was founded to help with the increased numbers of Welsh students at Oxford , and the founding Fellows included a number of individuals with links to Wales . The Commissioners included prominent individuals such as William Cecil , Lord Burghley , the Principal Secretary of State . The charter also gave land and buildings in Oxford to the new college . Whilst the foundation process of the college started in 1571 , it took more than fifty years and a further two charters , one in 1589 from Elizabeth and one in 1622 from her successor , James I , to complete the process . These further charters were necessary because neither the Commissioners appointed by the 1571 charter nor those appointed by the 1589 charter fulfilled their allotted task of drawing up statutes . During this time , Griffith Powell ( one of the Fellows who was pressing for statutes to be drawn up ) concluded that successive Principals were loath to have statutes , since these would limit the Principal 's powers . One Principal lost a draft copy of the statutes ; the next kept the next draft in his study for several years without taking steps to have them confirmed by the Commissioners . It was not until after the 1622 charter that statutes were approved by the Commissioners and the college was fully constituted . Despite the intention on the foundation of the college , none of the charters made special provision for Welsh students , although the students were predominantly Welsh from the outset .",
  "/wiki/James_I_of_England": "James VI and I ( James Charles Stuart ; 19 June 1566 - 27 March 1625 ) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death in 1625 . The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciaries , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union . James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died childless . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , returning to Scotland only once , in 1617 , and styled himself King of Great Britain and Ireland . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonisation of the Americas began . At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was the longest of any Scottish monarch . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament .",

In recognition of this royal connection , the college has also been known as King 's College and King 's Hall . The reigning monarch of the United Kingdom ( since 1952 , Elizabeth II ) is the official Visitor of the college . The original medieval foundation set up by Adam de Brome , under the patronage of Edward II , was called the House or Hall of the Blessed Mary at Oxford . The first design allowed for a provost and ten fellows , called scholars , and the college remained a small body of graduate fellows until the 16th century , when it started to admit undergraduates . During the English Civil War , Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the King 's Oxford Parliament . The main site of the college incorporates four medieval halls : Bedel Hall , St Mary Hall , St Martin Hall and Tackley 's Inn , the last being the earliest property acquired by the college and the oldest standing medieval hall in Oxford . The college has nearly 40 fellows , about 300 undergraduates and some 250 graduates . Oriel was the last of Oxford 's men 's colleges to admit women in 1985 , after more than six centuries as an all-male institution .

The college was founded by Elizabeth I on 27 June 1571 for the education of clergy , though students now study a broad range of secular subjects . A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh Price ( or Ap Rhys ) , a churchman from Brecon in Wales . The oldest buildings , in the first quadrangle , date from the 16th and early 17th centuries ; a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713 , and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906 . Further accommodation was built on the main site to mark the 400th anniversary of the college , in 1971 , and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east Oxford . The life of the college was disrupted by the English Civil War . Leoline Jenkins , who became principal after the war in 1661 , put the college on a more stable financial footing . Little happened at the college during the 18th century , and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards . Reforms of Oxford University after two Royal Commissions in the latter half of the 19th century led to removal of many of the restrictions placed on the college 's fellowships and scholarships , such that the college ceased to be predominantly full of Welsh students and academics . Students ' academic achievements rose in the early 20th century as fellows were appointed to teach in new subjects . Women were first admitted in 1974 and now form a large part of the undergraduate population .",
