  "/wiki/Black_Sunday_(1960_film)": "Black Sunday ( Italian : La maschera del demonio ) , also known as The Mask of Satan and Revenge of the Vampire in the UK , is a 1960 Italian gothic horror film directed by Mario Bava from a screenplay by Ennio de Concini and Mario Serandrei ( with uncredited contributions by Bava , Marcello Coscia and Dino Di Palma ) , and starring Barbara Steele , John Richardson , Arturo Dominici and Ivo Garrani . It was Bava 's official directorial debut , although he had completed several previous feature films without receiving an onscreen credit . Based very loosely on Nikolai Gogol 's short story Viy , the narrative concerns a witch who is put to death by her own brother , only to return 200 years later to seek revenge on her descendants . By the social standards of the 1960s , Black Sunday was considered unusually gruesome , and was banned in the UK until 1968 because of its violence . In the US , some of the gore was censored in-house by distributor American International Pictures before its theatrical release to the country 's cinemas , where it was shown as a double feature with Roger Corman 's The Little Shop of Horrors . Black Sunday was a worldwide critical and box office success , and launched the careers of Bava and Steele . In 2004 , one of its sequences was voted number 40 among the 100 Scariest Movie Moments by the Bravo TV network .",
  "/wiki/Mario_Bava": "Mario Bava ( 31 July 1914 - 27 April 1980 ) was an Italian filmmaker who worked variously as a director , screenwriter , cinematographer , and special effects artist . He is frequently referred to as the Master of Italian Horror and the Master of the Macabre . His low-budget genre films , known for their distinctive visual flair and stylish technical ingenuity , feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality , and the destructive capacity of human nature . Born to sculptor , cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava , the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry , and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy 's foremost cameramen , lighting and providing the special effects for such films as Hercules ( 1958 ) and its sequel Hercules Unchained ( 1959 ) ( each were lampooned on Mystery Science Theater 3000 ) . During the late 1950s , his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers , including I Vampiri ( 1957 ) ( the first Italian horror film of the sound era ) , The Day the Sky Exploded ( 1958 ) ( the first Italian science fiction film ) , Caltiki - The Immortal Monster ( 1959 ) and The Giant of Marathon ( 1959 ) . Although most of Bava 's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release , many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics , with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock . Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres : Black Sunday ( 1960 ) , his official directorial debut , was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle ; The Girl Who Knew Too Much ( 1963 ) is considered to be the first giallo film ; Kill , Baby , Kill ( 1966 ) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror ; Roy Colt & Winchester Jack ( 1970 ) is regarded as one of the earliest self-parodying Spaghetti Westerns ; Four Times That Night ( 1971 ) was an early Italian sex comedy ; and A Bay of Blood ( 1971 ) was a precursor to slasher films . His other notable films include Hercules in the Haunted World ( 1961 ) , Erik the Conqueror ( 1961 ) , Black Sabbath ( 1963 ) , The Whip and the Body ( 1963 ) , Blood and Black Lace ( 1964 ) , Planet of the Vampires ( 1965 ) , Knives of the Avenger ( 1966 ) , Danger : Diabolik ( 1968 ) , Hatchet for the Honeymoon ( 1970 ) , Five Dolls for an August Moon ( 1970 ) , Baron Blood ( 1972 ) , Lisa and the Devil ( 1974 ) , Rabid Dogs ( 1974 ) and Shock ( 1977 ) . Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime , Bava 's shy , self-deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry , and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood . Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento , Lucio Fulci , Federico Fellini , John Carpenter , Nicolas Winding Refn , Martin Scorsese , Tim Burton , Joe Dante , John Landis , Francis Ford Coppola , Roger Corman , Edgar Wright , Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino . His son and frequent assistant director , Lamberto Bava , later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right .",

He was the first to bring gothic horror alive in full colour , and the sexual overtones and explicit horror in his films , while mild by modern standards , were unprecedented in his day . His first major gothic horror film was The Curse of Frankenstein ( 1957 ) , which launched Hammer 's association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era . He went on to film several adaptations of classic horror subjects , including Dracula ( 1958 ) , The Mummy ( 1959 ) , and The Curse of the Werewolf ( 1961 ) . Given their subject matter and lurid approach , Fisher 's films , though commercially successful , were largely dismissed by critics during his career . It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an auteur in his own right . His most famous films are characterised by a blend of fairytale myth and the supernatural alongside themes of sexuality , morality , and the charm of evil . Drawing heavily on a Christian conservative outlook , there is often a hero who defeats the powers of darkness by a combination of faith in God and reason , in contrast to other characters , who are either blindly superstitious or bound by cold , godless rationalism .

Despite performing in a string of roles , including one as Osric in Laurence Olivier 's film adaptation of Hamlet ( 1948 ) , Cushing struggled greatly to find work during this period and began to consider himself a failure . His career was revitalised once he started to work in live television plays , and he soon became one of the most recognisable faces in British television .
