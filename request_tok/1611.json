Starring Tatsuya Fujiwara , Aki Maeda and Takeshi Kitano , the film follows a group of junior high-school students that are forced to fight to the death by the Japanese totalitarian government . The film drew controversy and was banned or excluded from distribution in several countries . Toei even refused to sell the film to any United States distributor for a long time , because Toei was worried of potential controversy and lawsuits ( until Anchor Bay Entertainment eventually acquired the film in 2010 for direct-to-video release ) . The film was first screened in Tokyo on more than 200 screens on December 16 , 2000 , with an R-15 rating , which is rarely used in Japan . It was the highest-grossing Japanese-language film for six weeks after its initial release , and it was later released in 22 countries worldwide , grossing approximately $ 30 million in eight countries . The film earned critical acclaim and , especially with its DVD releases , drew a large global cult following . It is often regarded as one of Fukasaku 's best films , and one of the best films of the 2000s . In 2009 , filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Battle Royale as the best film he had seen in the past two decades . Battle Royale was the last film to be directed by Fukasaku . He started working on a sequel , Battle Royale II : Requiem , but he died of prostate cancer on January 12 , 2003 , after shooting only one scene with Kitano . His son Kenta Fukasaku , who wrote the screenplay for both films , completed the film in 2003 .",

While he is known primarily as a comedian and TV host in his native Japan , abroad he is known almost exclusively for his work as a filmmaker . With the exception of his works as a film director , he is known almost exclusively by the stage name Beat Takeshi ( \u30d3\u30fc\u30c8\u305f\u3051\u3057 , B\u012bto Takeshi ) . Kitano rose to prominence in the 1970s as one half of the comedy duo Two Beat , before going solo and becoming one of the three biggest comedians in the country . After several small acting roles , he made his directorial debut with 1989 's Violent Cop and garnered international acclaim for Sonatine ( 1993 ) . He was not widely accepted as an accomplished director in Japan until Hana-bi won the Golden Lion in 1997 . In October 2017 , Kitano completed his Outrage crime trilogy with the release of Outrage Coda . He has received critical acclaim for his idiosyncratic cinematic work , winning numerous awards with Japanese film critic Nagaharu Yodogawa having once dubbed him the true successor to influential filmmaker Akira Kurosawa . Many of Kitano 's films are dramas about yakuza gangsters or the police . Described by critics as using an acting style that is highly deadpan or a camera style that approaches near-stasis , Kitano often uses long takes during which little appears to be happening , or editing that cuts immediately to the aftermath of an event . Many of his films express a bleak worldview , but are also filled with humor and affection for their characters .",

  "/wiki/Animation": "Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images . In traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . Today , most animations are made with computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings . Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets or clay figures . Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other . The illusion - as in motion pictures in general - is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement , but the exact causes are still uncertain . Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the ph\u00e9nakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope and film . Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally . For display on the computer , techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . Animation is more pervasive than many people realize . Apart from short films , feature films , animated GIF 's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images , animation is also prevalent in video games , motion graphics , user interfaces and visual effects .",

The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience .
