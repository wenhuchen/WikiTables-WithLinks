  "/wiki/Pearl": "A pearl is a hard , glistening object produced within the soft tissue ( specifically the mantle ) of a living shelled mollusk or another animal , such as fossil conulariids . Just like the shell of a mollusk , a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate ( mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite ) in minute crystalline form , which has been deposited in concentric layers . The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth , but many other shapes , known as baroque pearls , can occur . The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries . Because of this , pearl has become a metaphor for something rare , fine , admirable and valuable . The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild , but are extremely rare . These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls . Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those currently sold . Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry , but the quality of their iridescence is usually very poor and is easily distinguished from that of genuine pearls . Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry , but in the past were also used to adorn clothing . They have also been crushed and used in cosmetics , medicines and paint formulations . Whether wild or cultured , gem-quality pearls are almost always nacreous and iridescent , like the interior of the shell that produces them .",
