It borrows extensively , in all aspects , from Arabic and Persian and its speakers used the ( Perso-Arabic ) Ottoman Turkish alphabet for written communications . During the peak of Ottoman power ( c. 16th century CE ) , words of foreign origin in Turkish literature in the Ottoman empire heavily outnumbered native Turkish words , with Arabic and Persian vocabulary accounting for up to 88% of the Ottoman vocabulary in some texts . Consequently , Ottoman Turkish was largely unintelligible to the less-educated lower-class and to rural Turks , who continued to use kaba T\u00fcrk\u00e7e ( raw/vulgar Turkish ; compare Vulgar Latin ) , which used far fewer foreign loanwords and is the basis of the modern Turkish language . The Tanzim\u00e2t era ( 1839-1876 ) saw the application of the term Ottoman when referring to the language ( \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc , lis\u00e2n-\u0131 Osm\u00e2n\u00ee or \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0644\u064a\u062c\u0647 , Osmanl\u0131ca ) ; Modern Turkish makes the same distinction ( Osmanl\u0131ca and Osmanl\u0131 T\u00fcrk\u00e7esi ) .",

Outside Turkey , significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany , Austria , Bulgaria , North Macedonia , Northern Cyprus , Greece , the Caucasus , and other parts of Europe and Central Asia . Cyprus has requested that the European Union add Turkish as an official language , even though Turkey is not a member state . To the west , the influence of Ottoman Turkish - the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire - spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded . In 1928 , as one of Atat\u00fcrk 's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey , the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet . The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination . The basic word order of Turkish is subject-object-verb . Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender . The language makes usage of honorifics and has a strong T-V distinction which distinguishes varying levels of politeness , social distance , age , courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee . The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect .",
