In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

  "/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America": "The Confederate States of America ( CSA or C.S . ) - commonly referred to as the Confederacy - was an unrecognized republic in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865 . The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states - South Carolina , Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas - in the Lower South region of the United States , whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture , particularly cotton , and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves . Convinced that the institution of slavery was threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories , the Confederacy declared its secession in rebellion against the United States , with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War . Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and normal condition . Before Lincoln took office in March , a new Confederate government was established in February 1861 which was considered illegal by the government of the United States . States volunteered militia units , and the new government hastened to form its own Confederate States Army from nothing practically overnight . After the American Civil War began in April , four slave states of the Upper South - Virginia , Arkansas , Tennessee , and North Carolina - also seceded and joined the Confederacy . The Confederacy later accepted Missouri and Kentucky as members , although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces ; Confederate shadow governments attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them . The government of the United States ( the Union ) rejected the claims of secession , considering it illegitimate . The war began April 12 , 1861 , when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter , a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina . No foreign government ever officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country , although Great Britain and France granted it belligerent status , which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies .",

[ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops .
