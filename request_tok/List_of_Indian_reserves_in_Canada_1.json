They call their national territory Mi\ua78ckma\ua78cki ( or Mi\ua78cgma\ua78cgi ) . The nation has a population of about 170,000 ( including 18,044 members in the recently formed Qalipu First Nation in Newfoundland ) , of whom nearly 11,000 speak Mi\ua78ckmaq , an Eastern Algonquian language . Once written in Mi\ua78ckmaq hieroglyphic writing , it is now written using most letters of the Latin alphabet . The Sant\u00e9 Mawi\u00f3mi , or Grand Council , was the traditional senior level of government for the Mi\ua78ckmaq people until Canada passed the Indian Act ( 1876 ) to require First Nations to establish representative elected governments . After implementation of the Indian Act , the Grand Council took on a more spiritual function . The Grand Council was made up of chiefs of the seven district councils of Mi\ua78ckma\ua78cki . In 2011 , the Government of Canada announced recognition to a group in Newfoundland and Labrador called the Qalipu First Nation . The new band , which is landless , had accepted 25,000 applications to become part of the band by October 2012 . In total over 100,000 applications were sent in to join the Qalipu , equivalent of 1/5 of the province 's population . Several Mi\ua78ckmaq institutions , including the Grand Council , have argued that the Qalipu Mi'kmaq Band does not have legitimate aboriginal heritage and is accepting too many members .",
