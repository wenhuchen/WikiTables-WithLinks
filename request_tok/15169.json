  "/wiki/Las_Vegas_Cowboys": "The Las Vegas Cowboys were a professional American football team based in Las Vegas , Nevada . Their roots can be traced to the independent Quad Cities Raiders , who joined the new Professional Football League of America as the Rock Island Raiders in 1965 . The Raiders remained in the PFLA until its merger with the Continental Football League in 1968 . After losing their first two regular-season contests in 1968 ( and drawing only 1,200 fans for a game in Davenport , Iowa against the Chicago Owls ) , the Raiders were set to play the Indianapolis Capitols in Indiana . Instead , Indianapolis businessman Thomas Redmond swiftly purchased the club and announced the team would be known as the Las Vegas Cowboys ( who lost to the Caps , 41-0 on September 14 . ) ( League records consider the Raiders and Cowboys to be separate clubs . ) At the time , there was already a Las Vegas Cowboys franchise in the minor Western Football League , with Las Vegas holding a 1-1 record in that circuit ; Redmond apparently merged the two franchises , forfeited the Cowboys ' remaining games in the WFL , and played a Continental League schedule for the rest of 1968 . Featuring only five players from the old Quad Cities team , the Cowboys finished the 1968 season with a 1-11 record - which was still an improvement from Quad Cities ' 0-12 disaster of the previous year . In 1969 , the final season of the CoFL , Las Vegas improved drastically , both at the gate ( drawing 5,068 fans per game to Cashman Field , about double the 1968 figures ) and on the field , winning the Pacific Division with an 8-4 record . After routing the Sacramento Capitols , 31-0 , in the Pacific Division playoffs , the Cowboys were eliminated and in the second round by the eventual champion San Antonio Toros .

From 2000 to 2009 , the AFL had its own developmental league , the af2 .

The UFL occupied the second tier of professional football in the United States , behind the National Football League . The UFL primarily consisted of players who had previously played for an NFL team . Although the league had no connection with the NFL , and had never intended to foster any such connection , some speculated that it could have become a minor or developmental league for the NFL , including the UFL 's own commissioner . Early news reports had speculated that based on the UFL 's initial plan the league would become a competitor to the NFL . The UFL seemed poised to capitalize on fan disgust with the NFL should the established league lock out its players prior to the 2011\u221212 season . The thought was that the NFL would fail to reach an agreement with the NFL players ' union after the end of their collective bargaining agreement . This would have led to the 2011\u221212 NFL season being delayed or cancelled , leaving the UFL the only pro football available . The NFL did lock out their players , but the situation was resolved in July 2011 , before the start of the NFL season .

  "/wiki/XFL_(2001)": "The original XFL was a professional American football league that played its only season in 2001 . The XFL was operated as a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation ( now the WWE ) and NBC . The XFL was conceived as an outdoor football league that would begin play immediately after the National Football League season ended to take advantage of lingering public desire to watch football after the NFL and college football seasons had concluded . It was promoted as having fewer rules to encourage rougher play than other major leagues . The league had eight teams in two divisions , including major markets and some not directly served by the NFL , such as Birmingham , Las Vegas , Memphis , and Orlando . The XFL operated as a single entity with all teams owned by the league , in contrast to most major professional leagues , which use a franchise model with individual owners . Co-owner NBC served as the main carrier of XFL games , along with UPN and TNN . The presentation of XFL games featured sports entertainment elements inspired by professional wrestling , including heat and kayfabe , suggestively-dressed cheerleaders , and occasional usage of WWF personalities ( such as Jesse Ventura , Jim Ross , and Jerry Lawler ) as part of on-air commentary crews alongside sportscasters and veteran football players . Despite the wrestling influence , the games and their outcomes were legitimate . The first night of play brought higher television viewership than NBC had projected , but ratings quickly nosedived . The league developed a negative reputation due to its connections to professional wrestling and the WWF , the overall quality of play , and a presentation that differed starkly from network football telecasts of the era ( albeit featuring on-air innovations that would later become commonplace in football telecasts , such as aerial skycams and on-player microphones ) .
