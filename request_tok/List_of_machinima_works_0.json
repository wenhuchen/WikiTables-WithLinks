  "/wiki/Game_engine": "A game engine is a software-development environment designed for people to build video games . Developers use game engines to construct games for consoles , mobile devices , and personal computers . The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes a rendering engine ( renderer ) for 2D or 3D graphics , a physics engine or collision detection ( and collision response ) , sound , scripting , animation , artificial intelligence , networking , streaming , memory management , threading , localization support , scene graph , and may include video support for cinematics . Implementers often economize on the process of game development by reusing/adapting , in large part , the same game engine to produce different games or to aid in porting games to multiple platforms .

  "/wiki/Comedy_film": "A comedy film is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor . These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect . Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending ( black comedy being an exception ) . One of the oldest genres in film - and derived from the classical comedy in theatre - , some of the very first silent movies were comedies , as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions , without requiring sound . When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s , comedy films took another swing , as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue . Comedy , compared with other film genres , puts much more focus on individual stars , with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity . While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse , others contain political or social commentary ( such as The King of Comedy and Wag the Dog ) .",

  "/wiki/Comedy": "In a modern sense , comedy ( from the Greek : \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 , k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda ) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter , especially in theatre , television , film , stand-up comedy , books and novels or any other medium of entertainment . The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",

  "/wiki/Dark_Comedy": "Black comedy , also known as black humor , dark comedy , dark humor or gallows humor , is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo , particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss . Writers and comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues , by provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience . Thus , in fiction , for example , the term black comedy can also refer to a genre in which dark humor is a core component . Popular themes of the genre include death and violence , discrimination , disease , and human sexuality . Black comedy differs from both blue comedy - which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity , sex , and bodily fluids - and from straightforward obscenity . An archetypal example of black comedy in the form of self-mutilation appears in the English novel Tristram Shandy ; Tristram , five years old at the time , starts to urinate out of an open window for lack of a chamber pot . The sash falls and circumcises him ; his family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance . Whereas the term black comedy is a relatively broad term covering humor relating to many serious subjects , gallows humor tends to be used more specifically in relation to death , or situations that are reminiscent of dying . Black humor can occasionally be related to the grotesque genre . Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes .",

Reach was announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 in Los Angeles , California , and the first in-engine trailer was shown at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards . Players who purchased ODST were eligible to participate in a Reach multiplayer beta in May 2010 ; the beta allowed Bungie to gain player feedback for fixing bugs and making gameplay tweaks before shipping the final version .

  "/wiki/Parody": "A parody ( /\u02c8p\u00e6r\u0259di/ ) ; also called a spoof , send-up , take-off , lampoon , play on ( something ) , caricature , or joke , is a work created to imitate , make fun of , or comment on an original work - its subject , author , style , or some other target - by means of satiric or ironic imitation . As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it , parody . is imitation , not always at the expense of the parodied text . Another critic , Simon Dentith , defines parody as any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice . Parody may be found in art or culture , including literature , music ( although parody in music has an earlier , somewhat different meaning than for other art forms ) , animation , gaming , and film . The writer and critic John Gross observes in his Oxford Book of Parodies , that parody seems to flourish on territory somewhere between pastiche ( a composition in another artist 's manner , without satirical intent ) and burlesque ( which fools around with the material of high literature and adapts it to low ends ) . Meanwhile , the Encyclop\u00e9die of Denis Diderot distinguishes between the parody and the burlesque , A good parody is a fine amusement , capable of amusing and instructing the most sensible and polished minds ; the burlesque is a miserable buffoonery which can only please the populace . Historically , when a formula grows tired , as in the case of the moralistic melodramas in the 1910s , it retains value only as a parody , as demonstrated by the Buster Keaton shorts that mocked that genre .",

  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance : a play , opera , mime , ballet , etc. , performed in a theatre , or on radio or television . Considered as a genre of poetry in general , the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle 's Poetics ( c. 335 BC ) - the earliest work of dramatic theory . The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 , drama ) , which is derived from I do ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 , drao ) . The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy . In English ( as was the analogous case in many other European languages ) , the word play or game ( translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus ) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare 's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre . The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era . Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example , Zola 's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin ( 1873 ) or Chekhov 's Ivanov ( 1887 ) . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media . The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance . May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . The enactment of drama in theatre , performed by actors on a stage before an audience , presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception . The structure of dramatic texts , unlike other forms of literature , is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception .",
  "/wiki/Diary_of_a_Camper": "Diary of a Camper is a short American film made using id Software 's 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake , released in 1996 .

The film was first released over the Internet as a non-interactive game demo file . The video is generally considered the first known example of machinima - the art of using real-time , virtual 3D environments , often game engines , to create animated films . The story centers on a lone camper , a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle , who faces five members of the Rangers clan in a deathmatch , a type of multiplayer game in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible . Although players had previously recorded segments of gameplay , these were usually deathmatches or speedruns , attempts to complete a map as quickly as possible . Diary of a Camper was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue , instead of merely showing gameplay . Commentators have called the work primitive , but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking .",

  "/wiki/Action_film": "Action film is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events that typically include violence , extended fighting , physical feats , and frantic chases . Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life-threatening situations , a villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero ( though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the action film genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights , and shootouts . This genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres , and they may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction .",

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy .

  "/wiki/Situational_comedy": "A sitcom , clipping for situational comedy ( situation comedy in the U.S. ) , is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode . Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy , where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch , and stand-up comedy , where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience . Sitcoms originated in radio , but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms . A situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience , depending on the programme 's production format . The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track . During filming productions , the laugh track is usually pre-recorded . Critics disagree over the utility of the term sitcom in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century . Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track , thus often resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the traditional sitcom . Other topics of debate have included whether or not cartoons , such as The Simpsons or Family Guy , can be classified as sitcoms .",
  "/wiki/Comic_science_fiction": "Science fiction comedy or comic science fiction is a subgenre of science fiction or science fantasy that exploits the science-fiction ( SF ) genre 's conventions for comedic effect . Comic science fiction often mocks or satirizes standard SF conventions - such as alien invasion of Earth , interstellar travel , or futuristic technology . It can also satirize and criticize present-day society . An early example was the Pete Manx series by Henry Kuttner and Arthur K. Barnes ( sometimes writing together and sometimes separately , under the house pen-name of Kelvin Kent ) . Published in Thrilling Wonder Stories in the late 1930s and early 1940s , the series featured a time-traveling carnival barker who uses his con-man abilities to get out of trouble . Two later series cemented Kuttner 's reputation as one of the most popular early writers of comic science fiction : the Gallegher series ( about a drunken inventor and his narcissistic robot ) and the Hogben series ( about a family of mutant hillbillies ) . The former appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in 1943 and 1948 and was collected in hardcover as Robots Have No Tails ( Gnome , 1952 ) , and the latter appeared in Thrilling Wonder Stories in the late 1940s . In the 1950s comedy became more common in science fiction . [ citation needed ] Some of the authors contributing included : Alfred Bester , Harry Harrison , C.M .
