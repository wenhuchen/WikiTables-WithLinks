  "/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers": "The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay , Wisconsin .

It is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL , dating back to 1919 , and is the only non-profit , community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States . [ a ] Home games have been played at Lambeau Field since 1957 . The Packers are the last of the small town teams which were common in the NFL during the league 's early days of the 1920s and 1930s . Founded in 1919 by Earl Curly Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun , the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896 . Between 1919 and 1920 , the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest , before joining the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) , the forerunner of today 's NFL , in 1921 . Although Green Bay is by far the smallest major league professional sports market in North America , Forbes ranked the Packers as the world 's 27th most valuable sports franchise in 2019 , with a value of $ 2.63 billion . The Packers have won 13 league championships , the most in NFL history , with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories .

  "/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",
