The majority of the campus 's Norman-style buildings are constructed from gray and black granite . The campus is a popular tourist destination , with a visitor center and the oldest museum in the United States Army . Candidates for admission must both apply directly to the academy and receive a nomination , usually from a member of Congress or Delegate/Resident Commissioner in the case of Washington , D.C. , Puerto Rico , Northern Mariana Islands , Guam , American Samoa , and the Virgin Islands . Other nomination sources include the President and Vice President of the United States . Students are officers-in-training and are referred to as cadets or collectively as the United States Corps of Cadets ( USCC ) .

  "/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_FBS_independent_schools": "National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Football Bowl Subdivision independent schools are four-year institutions whose football programs are not part of an NCAA-affiliated conference . This means that FBS independents are not required to schedule each other for competition like conference schools do . There are fewer independent schools than in years past ; many independent schools join , or attempt to join , established conferences . The main reasons to join a conference are to gain a share of television revenue and access to bowl games that agree to take teams from certain conferences , and to help deal with otherwise potentially difficult challenges in scheduling opponents to play throughout the season . All Division I FBS independents are eligible for the College Football Playoff ( CFP ) , or for the so-called access bowls associated with the CFP , if they are chosen by the CFP selection committee . Notre Dame has a potential tie-in with the Orange Bowl . Army has an agreement with the Military Bowl ( formerly the EagleBank Bowl ) , and Notre Dame , in addition to its CFP agreement , has other bowl agreements as part of its affiliation with the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) . ( Notre Dame had similar agreements with its previous conference , the Big East . ) BYU had an agreement with the Armed Forces Bowl for 2011 . The ranks of football independents increased by one starting with the 2011 season with the announcement that BYU would leave the Mountain West Conference ( MWC ) to become a football independent starting with that season . The ranks increased by two in 2013 when the Western Athletic Conference ( WAC ) dropped football and New Mexico State and Idaho did not have a conference for football . The ranks of football independents decreased by two in 2014 with the return of Idaho and New Mexico State as football-only members of the Sun Belt Conference ( SBC ) and decreased by one more in 2015 with Navy joining the American Athletic Conference ( AAC ) as a football-only member .",

The conference 's members participated in 24 NCAA sports . The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history , while its shorter ( 1991 to 2013 ) football program , created by inviting one college and four other associate members ( their football programs only ) into the conference , resulted in two national championships . In basketball , Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships ( UConn with three , Villanova , Georgetown , Syracuse , and Louisville with one each ) . Of the Big East 's full members , all but South Florida attended the Final Four , the most of any conference , though Marquette , DePaul , Notre Dame , Rutgers , Cincinnati , and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East . In 2011 , the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men 's Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying . In football , the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991 , after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East , joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents ( Boston College , Pittsburgh and Syracuse ) to form a new Division I football league . The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series , when that series was created in 1998 . The Big East won two national football championships , both by University of Miami . Between 2005 and 2012 , four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences , starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013 . On July 1 , 2013 , the non-football playing schools ( also known collectively as the secular Catholic 7 ) formed a non-football playing conference that retains the Big East Conference name . The remaining six football-playing members , three of whom had only joined the Big East in 2005 when the earlier exodus had started , joined with four schools from other conferences to become the American Athletic Conference ( The American ) , which is the Big East 's legal successor .",

  "/wiki/Idaho_Vandals": "The Idaho Vandals are the intercollegiate athletic teams representing the University of Idaho , located in Moscow . The Vandals compete at the NCAA Division I level as a member of the Big Sky Conference . The football team was an independent for the 2013 season due to a major wave of departures from the Western Athletic Conference that left just two football-playing schools . In July 2014 , Idaho returned its football team to the Sun Belt Conference and the other sports rejoined the Big Sky Conference . The university 's official colors are silver and gold , honoring the state 's mining tradition . Because these metallic colors in tandem are not visually complementary for athletic uniforms , black and gold are the prevalent colors for the athletic teams , with an occasional use of silver , similar to Colorado , whose official colors are also silver and gold . When Idaho moved out of the Big Sky to the Big West in 1996 , the yellow Green Bay gold was changed to metallic Vegas gold . Yellow gold and black were the colors used by most of the varsity teams from 1978 to 1996 , initiated by first-year head football coach Jerry Davitch 's new uniforms for 1978 . On April 27 , 2016 , it was reported that the Vandals would become the first football program to voluntarily drop from the FBS level to the FCS level , beginning in 2018 . All previous programs to have moved from FBS to FCS level did so because the NCAA downgraded either the individual programs or their conferences .",
