  "/wiki/Urartu-Assyria_War": "The Urartu-Assyria War was a conflict between the Kingdom of Urartu and the Neo-Assyrian Empire . The war began around 714 BC , with the invasion of Urartu by the Assyrian King Sargon II . Sargon led multiple offensives deep into Urartian territory , amassing numerous victories in the war . Following his death , however , Urartian Kings Argishti II and Rusa II launched many successful counterattacks , reclaiming Urartu 's lost territory and gaining some from Assyria . However , their successors suffered multiple major defeats , resulting in Urartu becoming an Assyrian client state .",
  "/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire": "The Neo-Assyrian Empire was an Iron Age Mesopotamian empire , in existence between 911 and 609 BC , and became the largest empire of the world up until that time . The Assyrians perfected early techniques of imperial rule , many of which became standard in later empires , and was , according to many historians , the first real empire in history . The Assyrians were the first to be armed with iron weapons , and their troops employed advanced , effective military tactics . Following the conquests of Adad-nirari II in the late 10th century BC , Assyria emerged as the most powerful state in the world at the time , coming to dominate the Ancient Near East , East Mediterranean , Asia Minor , Caucasus , and parts of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa , eclipsing and conquering rivals such as Babylonia , Elam , Persia , Urartu , Lydia , the Medes , Phrygians , Cimmerians , Israel , Judah , Phoenicia , Chaldea , Canaan , the Kushite Empire , the Arabs , and Egypt . The Neo-Assyrian Empire succeeded the Old Assyrian Empire ( c. 2025-1378 BC ) , and the Middle Assyrian Empire ( 1365-934 BC ) of the Late Bronze Age . During this period , Aramaic was also made an official language of the empire , alongside Akkadian . Upon the death of Ashurbanipal in 631 BC , the empire began to disintegrate due to a brutal and unremitting series of civil wars in Assyria proper . In 616 BC , Cyaxares , king of the Medes and Persians , made alliances with Nabopolassar , ruler of the Babylonians and Chaldeans , and also the Scythians and Cimmerians against Assyria . At the Fall of Harran ( 609 BC ) , the Babylonians and Medes defeated an Assyrian-Egyptian alliance , after which Assyria largely ceased to exist as an independent state . A failed attempt to reconquer Harran ended the Assyrian Empire . Although the empire fell , Assyrian history continued ; there are still Assyrians living in Iran , Iraq , and elsewhere , in the present day .",

The kingdom rose to power in the mid-9th century BC , but went into gradual decline and was eventually conquered by the Iranian Medes in the early 6th century BC . The geopolitical region would re-emerge as Armenia shortly after . The peoples of Urartu are the earliest identifiable ancestors of the Armenians .",

In 331 BC Alexander 's army of the Hellenic League met the Persian army of Darius III near Gaugamela , close to the modern city of Dohuk in Iraqi Kurdistan . Though heavily outnumbered , Alexander emerged victorious due to his army 's superior tactics and his deft employment of light infantry .

The kingdom was founded and initially ruled by the royal Argead dynasty , which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties . Home to the ancient Macedonians , the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula , and bordered by Epirus to the west , Paeonia to the north , Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south . Before the 4th century BC , Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens , Sparta and Thebes , and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia . During the reign of the Argead king Philip II ( 359-336 BC ) , Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom through conquest and diplomacy . With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the sarissa pike , Philip II defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC . Philip II 's son Alexander the Great , leading a federation of Greek states , accomplished his father 's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted . During Alexander 's subsequent campaign of conquest , he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River . For a brief period , his empire was the most powerful in the world - the definitive Hellenistic state , inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization . Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy , engineering , and science spread throughout much of the ancient world . Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle , tutor to Alexander , whose writings became a keystone of Western philosophy . After Alexander 's death in 323 BC , the ensuing wars of the Diadochi , and the partitioning of Alexander 's short-lived empire , Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt , the Seleucid Empire , and the Kingdom of Pergamon .",

It was during this period that Rome 's control expanded from the city 's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world . Roman society under the Republic was a cultural mix of Latin , Etruscan , and Greek elements , which is especially visible in the Roman Pantheon . Its political organisation was strongly influenced by the Greek city states of Magna Graecia , with collective and annual magistracies , overseen by a senate . The top magistrates were the two consuls , who had an extensive range of executive , legislative , judicial , military , and religious powers . Whilst there were elections each year , the Republic was not a democracy , but an oligarchy , as a small number of powerful families ( called gentes ) monopolised the main magistracies . Roman institutions underwent considerable changes throughout the Republic to adapt to the difficulties it faced , such as the creation of promagistracies to rule its conquered provinces , or the composition of the senate . Unlike the Pax Romana of the Roman Empire , the Republic was in a state of quasi-perpetual war throughout its existence . Its first enemies were its Latin and Etruscan neighbours as well as the Gauls , who even sacked the city in 387 BC . The Republic nonetheless demonstrated extreme resilience and always managed to overcome its losses , however catastrophic . After the Gallic Sack , Rome conquered the whole Italian peninsula in a century , which turned the Republic into a major power in the Mediterranean . The Republic 's greatest enemy was doubtless Carthage , against which it waged three wars .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Armenia_(antiquity)": "The Kingdom of Armenia , also the Kingdom of Greater Armenia , or simply Greater Armenia ( Armenian : \u0544\u0565\u056e \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0584 Mets Hayk ; Latin : Armenia Maior ) , sometimes referred to as the Armenian Empire , was a monarchy in the Ancient Near East which existed from 321 BC to 428 AD . Its history is divided into successive reigns by three royal dynasties : Orontid ( 321 BC-200 BC ) , Artaxiad ( 189 BC-12 AD ) and Arsacid ( 52-428 ) . The root of the kingdom lies in one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia called Armenia ( Satrapy of Armenia ) , which was formed from the territory of the Kingdom of Ararat ( 860 BC-590 BC ) after it was conquered by the Median Empire in 590 BC . The satrapy became a kingdom in 321 BC during the reign of the Orontid dynasty after the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great , which was then incorporated as one of the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Seleucid Empire . Under the Seleucid Empire ( 312-63 BC ) , the Armenian throne was divided in two - Armenia Maior and Sophene - both of which passed to members of the Artaxiad dynasty in 189 BC . During the Roman Republic 's eastern expansion , the Kingdom of Armenia , under Tigranes the Great , reached its peak , from 83 to 69 BC , after it reincorporated Sophene and conquered the remaining territories of the falling Seleucid Empire , effectively ending its existence and raising Armenia into an empire for a brief period , until it was itself conquered by Rome in 69 BC . The remaining Artaxiad kings ruled as clients of Rome until they were overthrown in 12 AD due to their possible allegiance to Rome 's main rival in the region , Parthia . During the Roman-Parthian Wars , the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia was founded when Tiridates I , a member of the Parthian Arsacid dynasty , was proclaimed King of Armenia in 52 . Throughout most of its history during this period , Armenia was heavily contested between Rome and Parthia , and the Armenian nobility was divided among pro-Roman , pro-Parthian or neutrals . From 114 to 118 , Armenia briefly became a province of the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan . The Kingdom of Armenia often served as a client state or vassal at the frontier of the two large empires and their successors , the Byzantine and Sassanid empires . In 301 , Tiridates III proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of Armenia , making the Armenian kingdom the first state to embrace Christianity officially .",

  "/wiki/Parthian_Empire": "The Parthian Empire ( /\u02c8p\u0251\u02d0r\u03b8i\u0259n/ ; 247 BC - 224 AD ) , also known as the Arsacid Empire ( /\u02c8\u0251\u02d0rs\u0259s\u026ad/ ) , was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran . Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who , as leader of the Parni tribe , founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran 's northeast , then a satrapy ( province ) under Andragoras , in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire . Mithridates I of Parthia ( r. c. 171-138 BC ) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids . At its height , the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates , in what is now central-eastern Turkey , to eastern Iran . The empire , located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han dynasty of China , became a center of trade and commerce . The Parthians largely adopted the art , architecture , religious beliefs , and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire , which encompassed Persian , Hellenistic , and regional cultures . For about the first half of its existence , the Arsacid court adopted elements of Greek culture , though it eventually saw a gradual revival of Iranian traditions . The Arsacid rulers were titled the King of Kings , as a claim to be the heirs to the Achaemenid Empire ; indeed , they accepted many local kings as vassals where the Achaemenids would have had centrally appointed , albeit largely autonomous , satraps . The court did appoint a small number of satraps , largely outside Iran , but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates . With the expansion of Arsacid power , the seat of central government shifted from Nisa to Ctesiphon along the Tigris ( south of modern Baghdad , Iraq ) , although several other sites also served as capitals . The earliest enemies of the Parthians were the Seleucids in the west and the Scythians in the north . However , as Parthia expanded westward , they came into conflict with the Kingdom of Armenia , and eventually the late Roman Republic .",

The Roman force , led by Consul Lucius Licinius Lucullus , defeated Tigranes , and as a result , captured Tigranes ' capital city of Tigranocerta . The battle arose from the Third Mithridatic War being fought between the Roman Republic and Mithridates VI of Pontus , whose daughter Cleopatra was married to Tigranes . Mithridates fled to seek shelter with his son-in-law , and Rome invaded the Kingdom of Armenia . Having laid siege to Tigranocerta , the Roman forces fell back behind a nearby river when the large Armenian army approached . Feigning retreat , the Romans crossed at a ford and fell on the right flank of the Armenian army .

The war took place as a delicate balance of power between the Roman and Parthian empires was in place in the Caucasus . Rome was then ruled by Claudius , Parthia by Vologases I . Two Iberian brothers then ruled the Caucasian kingdoms , Pharasmanes I in Iberia , Mithridates in Armenia . They were both dependent on Roman support , which had installed Mithridates on the Armenian throne in 35 AD . However , 15 years later , trust between the brothers had deteriorated , which Tacitus blames on the intrigues of Pharasmanes ' son Rhadamistus . Fearing usurpation by Rhadamistus , his father convinced him to make war upon his uncle and claim the Armenian throne for himself . The Iberians invaded with a large army and surrounded Mithridates at the fortress of Gorneas ( Garni ) , which was garrisoned by the Romans under the command of Caelius Pollio , a prefect , and Casperius , a centurion . Rhadamistus was unable to take the fortress by assault or by siege . Pollio , swayed by bribery from Rhadamistus , betrayed Mithridates and induced the Roman soldiers to threaten the capitulation of the garrison . Under this threat , Mithridates left the fortress in order to make peace with Rhadamistus . Rhadamistus then executed Mithridates and his sons , despite a promise of non-violence , and became King of Armenia .",

Armenia had been a Roman client state since the days of Emperor Augustus , but in 52/53 , the Parthians succeeded in installing their own candidate , Tiridates , on the Armenian throne . These events coincided with the accession of Nero to the imperial throne in Rome , and the young emperor decided to react vigorously . The war , which was the only major foreign campaign of his reign , began with rapid success for the Roman forces , led by the able general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo . They overcame the forces loyal to Tiridates , installed their own candidate , Tigranes VI , on the Armenian throne , and left the country . The Romans were aided by the fact that the Parthian king Vologases was embroiled in the suppression of a series of revolts in his own country . As soon as these had been dealt with , however , the Parthians turned their attention to Armenia , and after a couple of years of inconclusive campaigning , inflicted a heavy defeat on the Romans in the Battle of Rhandeia . The conflict ended soon after , in an effective stalemate and a formal compromise : a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth sit on the Armenian throne , but his nomination had to be approved by the Roman emperor . This conflict was the first direct confrontation between Parthia and the Romans since Crassus ' disastrous expedition and Mark Antony 's campaigns a century earlier , and would be the first of a long series of wars between Rome and Iranian powers over Armenia ( see Roman-Persian Wars ) .",

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) .",

The third Caliph , Uthman ibn Affan ( r. 644-656 ) , was a member of the Umayyad clan . The family established dynastic , hereditary rule with Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan , long-time governor of Syria , who became the sixth Caliph after the end of the First Muslim Civil War in 661 . After Mu'awiyah 's death in 680 , conflicts over the succession resulted in a Second Civil War and power eventually fell into the hands of Marwan I from another branch of the clan . Syria remained the Umayyads ' main power base thereafter , and Damascus was their capital . The Umayyads continued the Muslim conquests , incorporating the Transoxiana , Sindh , the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula ( Al-Andalus ) into the Muslim world . At its greatest extent , the Umayyad Caliphate covered 11,100,000 km2 ( 4,300,000 sq mi ) and 33 million people , making it one of the largest empires in history in both area and proportion of the world 's population . The dynasty was eventually overthrown by a rebellion led by the Abbasids in 750 . Survivors of the dynasty established themselves in Cordoba which , in the form of an Emirate and then a Caliphate , became a world centre of science , medicine , philosophy and invention , ushering in the period of the Golden Age of Islam . The Umayyad caliphate ruled over a vast multiethnic and multicultural population .

It was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad 's uncle , Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib ( 566-653 CE ) , from whom the dynasty takes its name . They ruled as caliphs for most of the caliphate from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq , after having overthrown the Umayyad Caliphate in the Abbasid Revolution of 750 CE ( 132 AH ) . The Abbasid Caliphate first centred its government in Kufa , modern-day Iraq , but in 762 the caliph Al-Mansur founded the city of Baghdad , near the ancient Sasanian capital city of Ctesiphon . The Abbasid period was marked by reliance on Persian bureaucrats ( notably the Barmakid family ) for governing the territories as well as an increasing inclusion of non-Arab Muslims in the ummah ( national community ) . Persianate customs were broadly adopted by the ruling elite , and they began patronage of artists and scholars . Baghdad became a centre of science , culture , philosophy and invention in what became known as the Golden Age of Islam . Despite this initial cooperation , the Abbasids of the late 8th century had alienated both non-Arab mawali ( clients ) and Iranian bureaucrats . They were forced to cede authority over al-Andalus ( Spain ) to the Umayyads in 756 , Morocco to the Idrisid dynasty in 788 , Ifriqiya and Southern Italy to the Aghlabids in 800 , Iran to Saffarid in 861 and Egypt to the Isma'ili-Shia caliphate of the Fatimids in 969 . The political power of the caliphs was limited with the rise of the Iranian Buyids and the Seljuq Turks , who captured Baghdad in 945 and 1055 , respectively . Although Abbasid leadership over the vast Islamic empire was gradually reduced to a ceremonial religious function in much of the Caliphate , the dynasty retained control over its Mesopotamian domain . The Abbasids ' period of cultural fruition and its ( reduced ) territorial control ended in 1258 with the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols under Hulagu Khan and the execution of Al-Musta'sim .",

With each of the two contemporary powers in the region - the Abbasids and Byzantines - too preoccupied to concentrate their forces in subjugating the people of the region , and with the dissipation of several of the Armenian nakharar noble families , Ashot succeeded in asserting himself as the leading figure of a movement to dislodge the Arabs from Armenia . Ashot 's prestige rose as both Byzantine and Arab leaders - eager to maintain a buffer state near their frontiers - courted him . The Abbasid Caliphate recognized Ashot as prince of princes in 862 and , later on , as king ( in 884 or 885 ) . The establishment of the Bagratuni kingdom later led to the founding of several other Armenian principalities and kingdoms : Taron , Vaspurakan , Kars , Khachen and Syunik . Unity among all these states was sometimes difficult to maintain while the Byzantines and Arabs lost no time in exploiting the kingdom 's situation to their own gains .

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural and military force in Europe . Byzantine Empire is a term created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the Roman Empire ( Greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , tr .

Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West diverged . Constantine I ( r. 324-337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379-395 ) , Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . In the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610-641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin . Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527-565 ) , the empire reached its greatest extent , after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy and Rome , which it held for two more centuries .",

At its greatest extent , the Seljuk Empire controlled a vast area stretching from western Anatolia and the Levant to the Hindu Kush in the east , and from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf in the south . The Seljuk empire was founded by Tughril Beg ( 990-1063 ) and his brother Chaghri Beg ( 989-1060 ) in 1037 . From their homelands near the Aral Sea , the Seljuks advanced first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia , before eventually capturing Baghdad and conquering eastern Anatolia . Here the Seljuks won the battle of Manzikert in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire , which became one of the reasons for the first crusade ( 1095-1099 ) . From c. 1150-1250 , the Seljuk empire declined , and was invaded by the Mongols around 1260 . The Mongols divided Anatolia into emirates . Eventually one of these , the Ottoman , would conquer the rest . Seljuk gave his name to both the empire and the Seljuk dynasty . The Seljuks united the fractured political landscape of the eastern Islamic world and played a key role in the first and second crusades .

Located outside the Armenian Highlands and distinct from the Kingdom of Armenia of antiquity , it was centered in the Cilicia region northwest of the Gulf of Alexandretta . The kingdom had its origins in the principality founded c. 1080 by the Rubenid dynasty , an alleged offshoot of the larger Bagratid family , which at various times had held the thrones of Armenia and Georgia . Their capital was originally at Tarsus , and later became Sis . Cilicia was a strong ally of the European Crusaders , and saw itself as a bastion of Christendom in the East . It also served as a focus for Armenian nationalism and culture , since Armenia proper was under foreign occupation at the time . Cilicia 's significance in Armenian history and statehood is also attested by the transfer of the seat of the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church , spiritual leader of the Armenian people , to the region . In 1198 , with the crowning of Leo the Magnificent of the Rubenid dynasty , Cilician Armenia became a kingdom . In 1226 , the crown was passed to rival Hethumids through Leo 's daughter Isabella 's second husband , Hethum I . As the Mongols conquered vast regions of Central Asia and the Middle East , Hethum and succeeding Hethumid rulers sought to create an Armeno-Mongol alliance against common Muslim foes , most notably the Mamluks . In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , the Crusader states and the Mongol Ilkhanate disintegrated , leaving the Armenian Kingdom without any regional allies . After relentless attacks by the Mamluks in Egypt in the fourteenth century , the Cilician Armenia of the Lusignan dynasty , mired in an internal religious conflict , finally fell in 1375 .",

Three years later , he was proclaimed sultan following the death of his former master , the Zengid ruler Nur al-Din . For the next decade , the Ayyubids launched conquests throughout the region and by 1183 , their domains encompassed Egypt , Syria , Upper Mesopotamia , the Hejaz , Yemen and the North African coast up to the borders of modern-day Tunisia .

Western historians call the former the Ba\u1e25r\u012b period and the latter the Burj\u012b due to the political dominance of the regimes known by these names during the respective eras .

The Maml\u016bk state reached its height under Turkic rule with Arabic culture and then fell into a prolonged phase of decline under the Circassians . The sultanate 's ruling caste was composed of Mamluks , soldiers of predominantly Cuman-Kipchaks ( from Crimea ) , Circassian , Abkhazian , Oghuz Turks and Georgian slave origin . While Mamluks were purchased , their status was above ordinary slaves , who were not allowed to carry weapons or perform certain tasks .
