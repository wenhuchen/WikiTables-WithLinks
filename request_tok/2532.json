  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",
  "/wiki/M61_Vulcan": "The M61 Vulcan is a hydraulically , electrically or pneumatically driven , six-barrel , air-cooled , electrically fired Gatling-style rotary cannon which fires 20 mm rounds at an extremely high rate ( typically 6,000 rounds per minute ) . The M61 and its derivatives have been the principal cannon armament of United States military fixed-wing aircraft for sixty years . The M61 was originally produced by General Electric . After several mergers and acquisitions , it is currently produced by General Dynamics .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

The GSh-6-23 differs from most American multi-barreled aircraft cannon in that it is gas-operated , rather than externally powered via an electric , hydraulic , or pneumatic system . The GSh-6-23 uses the 23\u00d7115 Russian AM-23 round , fed via linked cartridge belt or a linkless feed system . The linkless system , adopted after numerous problems and failures with the belt feed , is limited . [ better source needed ] Fire control is electrical , using a 27 V DC system . The cannon has 10 pyrotechnic cocking charges , similar to those used in European gas-operated revolver cannons such as the DEFA 554 or Mauser BK-27 . The rapid rate of fire exhausts ammunition quickly : the Mikoyan MiG-31 aircraft , for example , with 260 rounds of ammunition ( 800 rounds maximum ) , would empty its magazine in less than two seconds . GSh-6-23M has the highest rate of fire out of any autocannon so far . The GSh-6-23 is used by the Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft , the MiG-31 interceptor aircraft , and the now-obsolete Sukhoi Su-15 among others . However , after two Su-24s were lost because of premature shell detonation in 1983 , and because of some other problems with gun usage ( such as system failures ) , usage of the GSh-6-23 was stopped by a decision of the Soviet Air Force Command . At present all aircraft in the Russian Air Force are flying with fully operational guns . It is also used in the SPPU-6 gun pod , which can traverse to \u221245\u00b0 elevation , and \u00b145\u00b0 azimuth .",
  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

  "/wiki/T249_Vigilante": "The T249 Vigilante was a prototype 37 mm self-propelled anti-aircraft gun ( SPAAG ) designed as a replacement for the Bofors 40 mm gun and M42 Duster in US Army service .

In the early 1960s , the Army decided that gun-based systems were outdated , and canceled further development in favor of the MIM-46 Mauler missile system that also failed to enter service . The designer , the Sperry Utah Engineering Laboratory , later revived the Vigilante , rechambering it for NATO-standard 35x228mm rounds and mounting it on a M48 tank chassis for the DIVADs contest .

During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia .
