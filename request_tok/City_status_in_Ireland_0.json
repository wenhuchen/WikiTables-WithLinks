Situated on a bay on the east coast , at the mouth of the River Liffey , it lies within the province of Leinster . It is bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains , a part of the Wicklow Mountains range . It has an urban area population of 1,173,179 , while the population of the Dublin Region ( formerly County Dublin ) as of 2016 [ update ] was 1,347,359 . The population of the Greater Dublin Area was 1,904,806 per the 2016 census . There is archaeological debate regarding precisely where Dublin was established by the Gaels in or before the 7th century AD . Later expanded as a Viking settlement , the Kingdom of Dublin , the city became Ireland 's principal settlement following the Norman invasion . The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest city in the British Empire before the Acts of Union in 1800 . Following the partition of Ireland in 1922 , Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State , later renamed Ireland . Dublin is a historical and contemporary centre for education , the arts , administration and industry . As of 2018 [ update ] the city was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ( GaWC ) as a global city , with a ranking of Alpha \u2212 , which places it amongst the top thirty cities in the world .",
  "/wiki/Royal_charter": "A royal charter is a formal grant issued by a monarch under royal prerogative as letters patent . Historically , they have been used to promulgate public laws , the most famous example being the British Magna Carta ( great charter ) of 1215 , but since the 14th century have only been used in place of private acts to grant a right or power to an individual or a body corporate . They were , and are still , used to establish significant organisations such as boroughs ( with municipal charters ) , universities and learned societies . Charters should be distinguished from royal warrants of appointment , grants of arms and other forms of letters patent , such as those granting an organisation the right to use the word royal in their name or granting city status , which do not have legislative effect . The British monarchy has issued over 1,000 royal charters . Of these about 750 remain in existence . The earliest charter recorded on the UK government 's list was granted to the University of Cambridge by the King of England in 1231 , although older charters are known to have existed including to the Worshipful Company of Weavers in England in 1150 and to the town of Tain in Scotland in 1066 . Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown , a recent example being that awarded to The Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors , in 2014 .",
  "/wiki/Lordship_of_Ireland": "The Lordship of Ireland ( Irish : Tiarnas na h\u00c9ireann ) , sometimes referred to retroactively as Norman Ireland , was the part of Ireland ruled by the King of England ( styled as Lord of Ireland ) and controlled by loyal Anglo-Norman lords between 1177 and 1542 . The lordship was created as a Papal fief following the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169-1171 . As the lord of Ireland was also the king of England , he was represented locally by a governor , variously known as justiciar , lieutenant , or Lord Deputy . The kings of England claimed lordship over the whole island , but in reality the king 's rule only ever extended to parts of the island . The rest of the island - known as Gaelic Ireland - remained under the control of various Gaelic Irish kingdoms or chiefdoms , who were often at war with the Anglo-Normans . The area under English rule and law grew and shrank over time , and reached its greatest extent in the late 13th and early 14th centuries . The lordship then went into decline , brought on by its invasion by Scotland in 1315-18 , the Great Famine of 1315-17 , and the Black Death of the 1340s . The fluid political situation and English feudal system allowed a great deal of autonomy for the Anglo-Norman lords in Ireland , who carved out earldoms for themselves and had almost as much authority as some of the native Gaelic kings . Some Anglo-Normans became Gaelicised and rebelled against the English administration . The English attempted to curb this by passing the Statutes of Kilkenny ( 1366 ) , which forbade English settlers from taking up Irish law , language , custom and dress . The period ended with the creation of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1542 .",

The capital and largest city is Dublin , which is located on the eastern side of the island . Around a third of the country 's population of 4.9 million people resides in the greater Dublin area . The sovereign state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland , a part of the United Kingdom . It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the Celtic Sea to the south , St George 's Channel to the south-east , and the Irish Sea to the east . It is a unitary , parliamentary republic . The legislature , the Oireachtas , consists of a lower house , D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann , an upper house , Seanad \u00c9ireann , and an elected President ( Uachtar\u00e1n ) who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state , but with some important powers and duties . The head of government is the Taoiseach ( Prime Minister , literally 'Chief ' , a title not used in English ) , who is elected by the D\u00e1il and appointed by the President ; the Taoiseach in turn appoints other government ministers . The state was created as the Irish Free State in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . It had the status of Dominion until 1937 when a new constitution was adopted , in which the state was named Ireland and effectively became a republic , with an elected non-executive president as head of state . It was officially declared a republic in 1949 , following the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 . Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955 .",

The Leinster province comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Meath , Leinster and Osraige . Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland , the historic fifths of Leinster and Meath gradually merged , mainly due to the impact of the Pale , which straddled both , thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster .

In 1613 , the city was granted a Royal Charter by King James I and gained the London prefix to reflect the funding of its construction by the London guilds . While the city is more usually known colloquially as Derry , Londonderry is also commonly used and remains the legal name . The old walled city lies on the west bank of the River Foyle , which is spanned by two road bridges and one footbridge . The city now covers both banks ( Cityside on the west and Waterside on the east ) . The population of the city was 83,652 at the 2001 Census , while the Derry Urban Area had a population of 90,736 . The district administered by Derry City and Strabane District Council contains both Londonderry Port and City of Derry Airport . Derry is close to the border with County Donegal , with which it has had a close link for many centuries .

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland": "The Kingdom of Ireland ( Classical Irish : R\u00edoghacht \u00c9ireann ; Modern Irish : R\u00edocht \u00c9ireann ) was a client state of England and then of Great Britain that existed from 1542 until 1800 . It was ruled by the monarchs of England and then of Great Britain in personal union with their other realms . The kingdom was administered from Dublin Castle nominally by the King or Queen , who appointed a viceroy ( the Lord Deputy , later Lord Lieutenant ) to rule in their stead . It had its own legislature ( the Parliament of Ireland ) , peerage ( the Peerage of Ireland ) , legal system , and state church ( the Protestant Church of Ireland ) . The territory of the Kingdom had formerly been a lordship ruled by the kings of England , founded in 1177 after the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland . By the 1500s the area of English rule had shrunk greatly , and most of Ireland was held by Gaelic Irish chiefdoms . In 1542 , King Henry VIII of England was made King of Ireland . The English began establishing control over the island , which sparked the Desmond Rebellions and the Nine Years War . It was completed in the 1600s . The conquest involved confiscating land from the native Irish and colonising it with settlers from Britain . In its early years , the Kingdom had limited recognition , as no Catholic countries in Europe recognised Henry and his heir Edward as monarch of Ireland ; although Catholic Queen Mary I was recognised as Queen of Ireland by Pope Paul IV . Catholics , who made up most of the population , were officially discriminated against in the Kingdom , [ citation needed ] which from the late 17th century was dominated by a Protestant Ascendancy .",

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland , Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland . In 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30% of the island 's total population and about 3% of the UK 's population . Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal . Northern Ireland was created in 1921 , when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 . Unlike Southern Ireland , which would become the Irish Free State in 1922 , the majority of Northern Ireland 's population were unionists , who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom . Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned . For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland , David Trimble , called a cold house for Catholics .",

Shipbuilding was also a key industry ; the Harland and Wolff shipyard , which built the RMS Titanic , was the world 's biggest shipyard . Belfast as of 2019 [ update ] has a major aerospace and missiles industry . Industrialisation , and the inward migration it brought , made Belfast Northern Ireland 's biggest city and it became the capital of Northern Ireland following the Partition of Ireland in 1922 .

  "/wiki/Letters_patent": "Letters patent ( always in the plural ) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch , president , or other head of state , generally granting an office , right , monopoly , title , or status to a person or corporation . Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices , or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms . Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown , such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms , as well as appointing a Royal Commission . In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm . A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent ( referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law ) granting exclusive rights in an invention ( or a design in the case of a design patent ) . In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to practice the invention , i.e. , put it into practical use . In the Holy Roman Empire , Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary , imperial patent was also the highest form of generally binding legal regulations , e. g. Patent of Toleration , Serfdom Patent etc . The opposite of letters patent are letters close ( Latin : litterae clausae ) , which are personal in nature and sealed so that only the recipient can read their contents . Letters patent are thus comparable to other kinds of open letter in that their audience is wide . It is not clear how the contents of letters patent became widely published before collection by the addressee , for example whether they were left after sealing by the king for inspection during a certain period by courtiers in a royal palace , who would disseminate the contents back to the gentry in the shires through normal conversation and social intercourse . Today , for example , it is a convention for the British prime minister to announce that they have left a document they wish to enter the public domain in the library of the House of Commons , where it may be freely perused by all members of parliament .",
  "/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was a sovereign state established by the Acts of Union 1800 , which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland . The United Kingdom , having financed the European coalition that defeated France during the Napoleonic Wars , developed a large Royal Navy that enabled the British Empire to become the foremost world power for the next century . The Crimean War with Russia was a relatively small operation in a century where Britain was largely at peace with the Great Powers . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . The Great Irish Famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland and increased calls for Irish land reform . The 19th century was an era of rapid economic modernisation and growth of industry , trade and finance , in which Britain largely dominated the world economy . Outward migration was heavy to the principal British overseas possessions and to the United States . The empire was expanded into most parts of Africa and much of South Asia . The Colonial Office and India Office ruled through a small number of administrators who managed the units of the empire locally , while democratic institutions began to develop . British India , by far the most important overseas possession , saw a short-lived revolt in 1857 . In overseas policy , the central policy was free trade , which enabled British and Irish financiers and merchants to operate successfully in many otherwise independent countries , as in South America . London formed no permanent military alliances until the early 20th century , when it began to cooperate with Japan , France and Russia , and moved closer to the United States .",

Up to the 9th century it consisted of several independent major kingdoms ( L\u00faighne , U\u00ed Maine , and Iarthar Connacht ) . Between the reigns of Conchobar mac Taidg M\u00f3r ( died 882 ) and his descendant , Aedh mac Ruaidri \u00d3 Conchobair ( reigned 1228-33 ) , it became a kingdom under the rule of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain A\u00ed dynasty , whose ruling sept adopted the surname Ua Conchobair . At its greatest extent , it incorporated the often independent Kingdom of Breifne , as well as vassalage from the lordships of western Mide and west Leinster . Two of its greatest kings , Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair ( 1088-1156 ) and his son Ruaidri Ua Conchobair ( c.1115-1198 ) greatly expanded the kingdom 's dominance , so much so that both became Kings of Ireland . The Kingdom of Connacht collapsed in the 1230s because of civil war within the royal dynasty , which enabled widespread Anglo-Irish settlement under Richard M\u00f3r de Burgh , 1st Baron of Connaught , and his successors . The English colony in Connacht shrank from c. 1300 to c. 1360 , with events such as the 1307 battle of Ahascragh ( see Donnchad Muimnech \u00d3 Cellaigh ) , the 1316 Second Battle of Athenry and the murder in June 1333 of William Donn de Burgh , 3rd Earl of Ulster , all leading to Gaelic resurgence and colonial withdrawal to towns such as Ballinrobe , Loughrea , Athenry , and Galway . Well into the 16th century kingdoms such as U\u00ed Maine and T\u00edr Fh\u00edacrach M\u00faaidhe remained beyond English rule , while many Anglo-Irish families such as de Burgh , de Bermingham , de Exeter , de Staunton , became entirely Gaelicised . Only in the late 1500s , during the Tudor conquest of Ireland , was Connacht shired into its present counties .
