The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group .

  "/wiki/House_church": "A house church or home church is a label used to describe a group of Christians who regularly gather for worship in private homes . The group may be part of a larger Christian body , such as a parish , but some have been independent groups that see the house church as the primary form of Christian community . Sometimes these groups meet because the membership is small , and a home is the most appropriate place to assemble until such time as the group has sufficient funds to rent a regular place to meet ( as in the beginning phase of the British New Church Movement ) . Sometimes this meeting style is advantageous because the group is a member of a Christian congregation which is otherwise banned from meeting as is the case in China and Iran . Some recent Christian writers have supported the view that the Christian Church should meet in houses , and have based the operation of their communities around multiple small home meetings . Other Christian groups choose to meet in houses when they are in the early phases of church growth because a house is the most affordable option for the small group to meet until the number of people attending the group is sufficient to warrant moving to a commercial location such as a church building . House church organizations claim that this approach is preferable to public meetings in dedicated buildings because it is a more effective way of building community and personal relationships , and it helps the group to engage in outreach more naturally . Some believe small churches were a deliberate apostolic pattern in the first century , and they were intended by Christ .",
  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement .

It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",

It is the world 's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world 's population , commonly known as Muslims . Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries . Islam teaches that God is merciful , all-powerful , and unique , and has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , believed to be the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative examples ( called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith ) of Muhammad ( c. 570 - 8 June 632 CE ) . Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses and Jesus . Muslims consider the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and unrighteous punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law ( sharia ) , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam . Aside from the theological narrative , Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century , during the Abbasid Caliphate , when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing .",

The division of the Plymouth Brethren into the Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren took place in 1848 . Open Brethren are also commonly known as Plymouth Brethren , especially in North America . Many Open Brethren outside of North America , however , are unwilling to use the Plymouth Brethren designation because it is associated with the Exclusive Brethren , particularly the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church , which has often been accused of being a cult and has attracted a considerable degree of unfavourable publicity in the media . The Brethren are committed to missionary work and hold that the Bible is the first authority in matters of faith and practice .

  "/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses": "Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group reports a worldwide membership of approximately 8.68 million adherents involved in evangelism and an annual Memorial attendance of over 20 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Warwick , New York , United States , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity . The group emerged from the Bible Student movement founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell , who also co-founded Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881 to organize and print the movement 's publications . A leadership dispute after Russell 's death resulted in several groups breaking away , with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining control of the Watch Tower Society and its properties . Rutherford made significant organizational and doctrinal changes , including adoption of the name Jehovah 's witnesses [ note 1 ] in 1931 to distinguish them from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell 's traditions . Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and for refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider the use of God 's name vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines . They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity . They prefer to use their own Bible translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other Bible translations .",
  "/wiki/Organizational_structure_of_Jehovah's_Witnesses": "Jehovah 's Witnesses are organized hierarchically , and are led by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses from the Watch Tower Society 's headquarters in Warwick , New York . The Governing Body , along with other helpers , are organized into six committees responsible for various administrative functions within the global Witness community , including publication , assembly programs and evangelizing activity . The Governing Body and its committees supervise operations of nearly one hundred branch offices worldwide . Each branch office oversees the activities of Jehovah 's Witnesses in a particular country or region , and may include facilities for the publication and distribution of Watch Tower Society literature . Directly appointed by the Governing Body , branch committees supervise administrative functions for congregations in their jurisdiction . Congregations are further organized into circuits of about twenty congregations each . The Governing Body directly appoints circuit overseers as its representatives to supervise activities within circuits . Headquarters representatives visit groups of branch offices to provide instruction and report the branch 's activities to the Governing Body . Each congregation is served by a group of locally recommended male elders and ministerial servants , appointed by the circuit overseer . Elders take responsibility for congregational governance , pastoral work , setting meeting times , selecting speakers , conducting meetings , directing the public preaching work , and forming judicial committees to investigate and decide disciplinary action in cases where members are believed to have committed serious sins . Ministerial servants fulfil clerical and attendant duties , but may also teach and conduct meetings .",
  "/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , often informally known as the LDS Church or Mormon Church , is a nontrinitarian , Christian restorationist church that considers itself to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ . The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City , Utah , in the United States , and has established congregations and built temples worldwide . According to the church , it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries . In 2012 , the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States , with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018 . It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening . Adherents , often referred to as Latter-day Saints or , less formally , Mormons , view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion . Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ , though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity . The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts : the Bible ( both Old and New Testaments ) , the Book of Mormon , the Doctrine and Covenants , and the Pearl of Great Price . Other than the Bible , the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible , texts described as lost parts of the Bible , and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets . Because of some of the doctrinal differences , Catholic , Orthodox , and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity . Under the doctrine of continuing revelation , Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day prophet , seer , and revelator and that Jesus Christ , under the direction of God the Father , leads the church by revealing his will to its president . Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives .",

  "/wiki/Bell_tower": "A bell tower is a tower that contains one or more bells , or that is designed to hold bells even if it has none . Such a tower commonly serves as part of a church , and will contain church bells , but there are also many secular bell towers , often part of a municipal building , an educational establishment , or a tower built specifically to house a carillon . Church bell towers often incorporate clocks , and secular towers usually do , as a public service . The term campanile ( /\u02cck\u00e6mp\u0259\u02c8ni\u02d0li , -le\u026a/ , also US : /\u02cck\u0251\u02d0m-/ , Italian : [ kampa\u02c8ni\u02d0le ] ) , deriving from the Italian campanile , which in turn derives from campana , meaning bell , is synonymous with bell tower ; though in English usage campanile tends to be used to refer to a free standing bell tower . A bell tower may also in some traditions be called a belfry , though this term may also refer specifically to the substructure that houses the bells and the ringers rather than the complete tower .

  "/wiki/Stained_glass": "The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it . Throughout its thousand-year history , the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings . Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows , the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture . Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight . Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages . In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived .",
  "/wiki/Spiritualism": "Spiritualism is a religious movement based on the belief that the spirits of the dead exist and have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living . The afterlife , or the spirit world , is seen by spiritualists , not as a static place , but as one in which spirits continue to evolve . These two beliefs - that contact with spirits is possible , and that spirits are more advanced than humans - lead spiritualists to a third belief : that spirits are capable of providing useful knowledge about moral and ethical issues , as well as about the nature of God . Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as spirit guides - specific spirits , often contacted , who are relied upon for spiritual guidance . Spiritism , a branch of spiritualism developed by Allan Kardec and today practiced mostly in Continental Europe and Latin America , especially in Brazil , emphasizes reincarnation . Spiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s , especially in English-speaking countries . By 1897 , spiritualism was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe , mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes . Spiritualism flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization , attaining cohesion through periodicals , tours by trance lecturers , camp meetings , and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums . Many prominent spiritualists were women , and like most spiritualists , supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women 's suffrage . By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud perpetrated by mediums , and formal spiritualist organizations began to appear . Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational spiritualist churches in the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/Congregational_church": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others .",
