As a member of the First Continental Congress , where he was a signee to the Continental Association , Dickinson drafted most of the 1774 Petition to the King , and then , as a member of the Second Continental Congress , wrote the 1775 Olive Branch Petition . When these two attempts to negotiate with King George III of Great Britain failed , Dickinson reworked Thomas Jefferson 's language and wrote the final draft of the 1775 Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms . When Congress then decided to seek independence from Great Britain , Dickinson served on the committee that wrote the Model Treaty , and then wrote the first draft of the 1776-1777 Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union . Dickinson also composed The Liberty Song . Dickinson later served as President of the 1786 Annapolis Convention , which called for the Constitutional Convention of 1787 . Dickinson attended the Convention as a delegate from Delaware .

The success of his letters earned Dickinson considerable fame .

  "/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War": "The American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , also known as the American War of Independence , was fought primarily between the Kingdom of Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies in America ; it resulted in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the United States of America . [ N 1 ] After 1765 , growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies . Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts , which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor . Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony . Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves , and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown . Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress ( with the exception of Georgia ) to coordinate their resistance , establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power . British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in Concord led to open combat and a British defeat on April 19 , 1775 . Militia forces then besieged Boston , forcing a British evacuation in March 1776 , and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army . Concurrently , the Americans failed decisively in an attempt to invade Quebec and raise insurrection against the British . On July 2 , 1776 , the Second Continental Congress voted for independence , issuing its declaration on July 4 .

It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish , although the degree of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the dialect and accent of the speaker . Written Norwegian and Danish are usually more easily understood by Swedish speakers than the spoken languages , due to the differences in tone , accent and intonation . Swedish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . It has the most speakers of the North Germanic languages . Standard Swedish , spoken by most Swedes , is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century . While distinct regional varieties descending from the older rural dialects still exist , the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized . The standard word order is , as in most Germanic languages , V2 , which means that the finite verb ( V ) appears in the second position ( 2 ) of a declarative main clause . Swedish morphology is similar to English ; that is , words have comparatively few inflections . Swedish has two genders and is generally seen to have two grammatical cases - nominative and genitive ( except for pronouns that , as in English , also are inflected in the object form ) - although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive s , then seen as a clitic . Swedish has two grammatical numbers - plural and singular . Adjectives have discrete comparative and superlative forms and are also inflected according to gender , number and definiteness .",

Board of Education , the 1954 decision of the United States Supreme Court which found unconstitutional racial segregation in United States public schools . Gebhart is unique among the four Brown cases in that the trial court ordered that African-American children be admitted to the state 's segregated whites-only schools , and the state Supreme Court affirmed the trial court 's decision .

  "/wiki/Brown_vs._Board_of_Education": "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) , was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional , even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality . Handed down on May 17 , 1954 , the Court 's unanimous ( 9-0 ) decision stated that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal , and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution . However , the decision 's 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools , and the Court 's second decision in Brown II ( 349 U.S. 294 ( 1955 ) ) only ordered states to desegregate with all deliberate speed . The case originated in 1951 , when the public school district in Topeka , Kansas , refused to enroll the daughter of local black resident Oliver Brown at the school closest to their home , instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black elementary school farther away . The Browns and twelve other local black families in similar situations then filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Topeka Board of Education , alleging that its segregation policy was unconstitutional . A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas rendered a verdict against the Browns , relying on the precedent of the Supreme Court 's 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson , in which the Court had ruled that racial segregation was not in itself a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause if the facilities in question were otherwise equal , a doctrine that had come to be known as separate but equal . The Browns , then represented by NAACP chief counsel Thurgood Marshall , appealed to the Supreme Court , which agreed to hear the case . The Court 's decision in Brown partially overruled Plessy v. Ferguson by declaring that the separate but equal notion was unconstitutional for American public schools and educational facilities . [ note 1 ] It paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement , and a model for many future impact litigation cases . In the American South , especially the Deep South , where racial segregation was deeply entrenched , the reaction to Brown among most white people was noisy and stubborn . Many Southern governmental and political leaders embraced a plan known as Massive Resistance , created by Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd , in order to frustrate attempts to force them to de-segregate their school systems . Four years later , in the case of Cooper v. Aaron , the Court reaffirmed its ruling in Brown , and explicitly stated that state officials and legislators had no power to nullify its ruling .",

The Lee Resolution for independence was passed on July 2 with no opposing votes . The Committee of Five had drafted the Declaration to be ready when Congress voted on independence . John Adams , a leader in pushing for independence , had persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document , which Congress edited to produce the final version . The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted to declare independence from Great Britain , more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War .
