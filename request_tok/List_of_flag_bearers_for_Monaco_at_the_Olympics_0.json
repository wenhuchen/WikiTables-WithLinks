  "/wiki/Bobsleigh": "Bobsleigh or bobsled is a team winter sport that involves making timed runs down narrow , twisting , banked , iced tracks in a gravity-powered sleigh . International bobsleigh competitions are governed by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation , also known as FIBT from the French F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing . National competitions are often governed by bodies such as the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation and Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton . The first bobsleds were built in St. Moritz , Switzerland , in the late 19th century by wealthy tourists from Victorian Britain who were staying at the Palace Hotel owned by Caspar Badrutt . The early sleds were adapted from boys ' delivery sleds and toboggans . These eventually evolved into bobsleighs , luges and skeletons . Initially the tourists would race their hand-built contraptions down the narrow streets of St. Moritz , however , as collisions increased growing opposition from St Moritz residents led to bobsledding being eventually banned from public highways . In the winter of 1884 , Badrutt had a purpose-built run constructed near the hamlet of Cresta . The Cresta Run remains the oldest in the world and is the home of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club . It has hosted two Olympic Winter Games and is still in use . Modern Bobsleigh teams compete to complete a downhill route in the fastest times . An aggregate time from several runs is used to determine the winners .",

These Games , which were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States , marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens - the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games . They were also the first since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics , under a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating , even-numbered years . More than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports , including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball , mountain biking , and softball , as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing and women 's football ( soccer ) . 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debut in Atlanta , including eleven former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations . The hosting United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals , and the most gold ( 44 ) and silver ( 32 ) medals out of all countries . The U.S. topped the medal count for the first time since 1984 , and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics . Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi - who became the first men 's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal , Donovan Bailey - who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men 's 100 meters , and Lilia Podkopayeva - who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics . The festivities were marred by violence on July 27 , when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park - a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games ' festivities , killing 1 and injuring 111 . In 2003 , Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related attacks on abortion centers and a gay bar , and was sentenced to life in prison . He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors .",

Finnish ski jumper Matti Nyk\u00e4nen and Dutch speed skater Yvonne van Gennip were individual medal leaders with each winning three gold medals . The games are also remembered for the heroic failure of British ski jumper Eddie The Eagle Edwards , and the Winter Olympic d\u00e9but of the Jamaica national bobsled team , both of which would be subjects of major feature films about their participation in the games . The Calgary games were at the time one of the most expensive Olympics ever held , but the organizing committee turned record television and sponsorship revenue into a net surplus that was used to maintain the facilities built for the Olympics and develop the Calgary region into the heart of Canada 's elite winter sports program .

Despite the field being depleted in certain sports due to the boycott , 140 National Olympic Committees took part , which was a record at the time .
