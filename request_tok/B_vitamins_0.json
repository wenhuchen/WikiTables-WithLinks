  "/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)": "A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound or metallic ion that is required for an enzyme 's activity as a catalyst , a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction . Cofactors can be considered helper molecules that assist in biochemical transformations . The rates at which these happen are characterized by in an area of study called enzyme kinetics . Cofactors typically differ from ligands in that they often derive their function by remaining bound . Cofactors can be divided into two types , either inorganic ions , or complex organic molecules called coenzymes . Coenzymes are mostly derived from vitamins and other organic essential nutrients in small amounts . ( Note that some scientists limit the use of the term cofactor to inorganic substances ; both types are included here . ) Coenzymes are further divided into two types . The first is called a prosthetic group , which consists of a coenzyme that is tightly or even covalently , and permanently bound to a protein . The second type of coenzymes are called cosubstrates , and are transiently bound to the protein . Cosubstrates may be released from a protein at some point , and then rebind later . Both prosthetic groups and cosubstrates have the same function , which is to facilitate the reaction of enzymes and protein .",
  "/wiki/Catabolism": "Catabolism ( /k\u0259\u02c8t\u00e6b\u0259l\u026asm/ ) is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions . Catabolism breaks down large molecules ( such as polysaccharides , lipids , nucleic acids and proteins ) into smaller units ( such as monosaccharides , fatty acids , nucleotides , and amino acids , respectively ) . Catabolism is the breaking-down aspect of metabolism , whereas anabolism is the building-up aspect . Cells use the monomers released from breaking down polymers to either construct new polymer molecules , or degrade the monomers further to simple waste products , releasing energy . Cellular wastes include lactic acid , acetic acid , carbon dioxide , ammonia , and urea . The creation of these wastes is usually an oxidation process involving a release of chemical free energy , some of which is lost as heat , but the rest of which is used to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . This molecule acts as a way for the cell to transfer the energy released by catabolism to the energy-requiring reactions that make up anabolism . ( Catabolism is seen as destructive metabolism and anabolism as constructive metabolism ) . Catabolism therefore provides the chemical energy necessary for the maintenance and growth of cells . Examples of catabolic processes include glycolysis , the citric acid cycle , the breakdown of muscle protein in order to use amino acids as substrates for gluconeogenesis , the breakdown of fat in adipose tissue to fatty acids , and oxidative deamination of neurotransmitters by monoamine oxidase .",
  "/wiki/Sugar": "Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting , soluble carbohydrates , many of which are used in food . Simple sugars , also called monosaccharides , include glucose , fructose , and galactose . Compound sugars , also called disaccharides or double sugars , are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond . Common examples are sucrose ( glucose + fructose ) , lactose ( glucose + galactose ) , and maltose ( two molecules of glucose ) . In the body , compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars . Table sugar , granulated sugar or regular sugar refers to sucrose , a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose . Longer chains of monosaccharides are not regarded as sugars , and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides . Some other chemical substances , such as glycerol and sugar alcohols , may have a sweet taste , but are not classified as sugar . Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants . Honey and fruit are abundant natural sources of unbounded simple sugars . Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet , making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar . In 2016 , the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes .",
  "/wiki/Amino_acid": "Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amine ( -NH2 ) and carboxyl ( -COOH ) functional groups , along with a side chain ( R group ) specific to each amino acid . The key elements of an amino acid are carbon ( C ) , hydrogen ( H ) , oxygen ( O ) , and nitrogen ( N ) , although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids . About 500 naturally occurring amino acids are known ( though only 20 appear in the genetic code ) and can be classified in many ways . They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups ' locations as alpha- ( \u03b1- ) , beta- ( \u03b2- ) , gamma- ( \u03b3- ) or delta- ( \u03b4- ) amino acids ; other categories relate to polarity , pH level , and side chain group type ( aliphatic , acyclic , aromatic , containing hydroxyl or sulfur , etc. ) . In the form of proteins , amino acid residues form the second-largest component ( water is the largest ) of human muscles and other tissues . Beyond their role as residues in proteins , amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis . In biochemistry , amino acids having both the amine and the carboxylic acid groups attached to the first ( alpha- ) carbon atom have particular importance . They are known as 2- , alpha- , or \u03b1-amino acids ( generic formula H2NCHRCOOH in most cases , [ a ] where R is an organic substituent known as a side chain ) ; often the term amino acid is used to refer specifically to these . They include the 22 proteinogenic ( protein-building ) amino acids , which combine into peptide chains ( polypeptides ) to form the building-blocks of a vast array of proteins . These are all L-stereoisomers ( left-handed isomers ) , although a few D-amino acids ( right-handed ) occur in bacterial envelopes , as a neuromodulator ( D-serine ) , and in some antibiotics . Twenty of the proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in the genetic code and are known as standard amino acids . The other two ( non-standard or non-canonical ) are selenocysteine ( present in many prokaryotes as well as most eukaryotes , but not coded directly by DNA ) , and pyrrolysine ( found only in some archaea and one bacterium ) .",

  "/wiki/Flavin_adenine_dinucleotide": "In biochemistry , flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) is a redox-active coenzyme associated with various proteins , which is involved with several important enzymatic reactions in metabolism . A flavoprotein is a protein that contains a flavin group , this may be in the form of FAD or flavin mononucleotide ( FMN ) . There are many flavoproteins besides components of the succinate dehydrogenase complex , including \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ; some examples are shown in section 6 . FAD can exist in four different redox states , which are the flavin-N ( 5 ) -oxide , quinone , semiquinone , and hydroquinone . FAD is converted between these states by accepting or donating electrons . FAD , in its fully oxidized form , or quinone form , accepts two electrons and two protons to become FADH2 ( hydroquinone form ) . The semiquinone ( FADH\u00b7 ) can be formed by either reduction of FAD or oxidation of FADH2 by accepting or donating one electron and one proton , respectively . Some proteins , however , generate and maintain a superoxidized form of the flavin cofactor , the flavin-N ( 5 ) -oxide .",
  "/wiki/Flavin_mononucleotide": "Flavin mononucleotide ( FMN ) , or riboflavin-5\u2032-phosphate , is a biomolecule produced from riboflavin ( vitamin B2 ) by the enzyme riboflavin kinase and functions as the prosthetic group of various oxidoreductases , including NADH dehydrogenase , as well as cofactor in biological blue-light photo receptors . During the catalytic cycle , a reversible interconversion of the oxidized ( FMN ) , semiquinone ( FMNH\u2022 ) , and reduced ( FMNH2 ) forms occurs in the various oxidoreductases . FMN is a stronger oxidizing agent than NAD and is particularly useful because it can take part in both one- and two-electron transfers . In its role as blue-light photo receptor , ( oxidized ) FMN stands out from the 'conventional ' photo receptors as the signaling state and not an E/Z isomerization . It is the principal form in which riboflavin is found in cells and tissues . It requires more energy to produce , but is more soluble than riboflavin .",
  "/wiki/Flavoprotein": "Flavoproteins are proteins that contain a nucleic acid derivative of riboflavin : the flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) or flavin mononucleotide ( FMN ) . Flavoproteins are involved in a wide array of biological processes , including removal of radicals contributing to oxidative stress , photosynthesis , and DNA repair . The flavoproteins are some of the most-studied families of enzymes . Flavoproteins have either FMN or FAD as a prosthetic group or as a cofactor . The flavin is generally tightly bound ( see example adrenodoxin reductase wherein the FAD is deeply buried in the enzyme ) . About 5-10% of flavoproteins have a covalently linked FAD . Based on the available structural data , FAD-binding sites can be divided into more than 200 different types . 90 flavoproteins are encoded in the human genome ; about 84% require FAD , and around 16% require FMN , whereas 5 proteins require both . Flavoproteins are mainly located in the mitochondria . Of all flavoproteins , 90% perform redox reactions and the other 10% are transferases , lyases , isomerases , ligases .",

Niacin is obtained in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods , with highest contents in fortified packaged foods , tuna , salmon , some vegetable and other animal sources . Some countries require its addition to grains . Supplemental niacin is primarily used to treat high blood cholesterol and pellagra ( niacin deficiency ) . Insufficient amounts of niacin can cause nausea , skin and mouth lesions , anemia , headaches , and tiredness . This lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency diseases , which are caused by a lack of five crucial vitamins ( niacin , vitamin C , thiamin , vitamin D , and vitamin A ) and are usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition . Niacin supplementation has not been found useful for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already on a statin , but appears to be effective in those not taking a statin . Although niacin and nicotinamide ( niacinamide ) are identical in their vitamin activity , nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological effects ( lipid-modifying effects ) as niacin . When niacin takes on the -amide group , it does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing . As the precursor for NAD and NADP , niacin is also involved in DNA repair . In 2016 it was the 277th most prescribed medication in the United States with more than a million prescriptions .",

However , it is also used in other cellular processes , most notably a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins , in posttranslational modifications . Because of the importance of these functions , the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery .

The three main purposes of metabolism are : the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes ; the conversion of food/fuel to building blocks for proteins , lipids , nucleic acids , and some carbohydrates ; and the elimination of nitrogenous wastes . These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce , maintain their structures , and respond to their environments . ( The word metabolism can also refer to the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms , including digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells , in which case the above described set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism ) . Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic - the breaking down of compounds ( for example , the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration ) ; or anabolic - the building up ( synthesis ) of compounds ( such as proteins , carbohydrates , lipids , and nucleic acids ) . Usually , catabolism releases energy , and anabolism consumes energy . The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways , in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical , each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme . Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves , by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy . Enzymes act as catalysts - they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly - and they also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction , for example in response to changes in the cell 's environment or to signals from other cells . The metabolic system of a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous . For example , some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient , yet this gas is poisonous to animals . The basal metabolic rate of an organism is the measure of the amount of energy consumed by all of these chemical reactions .",

Gluconeogenesis is one of several main mechanisms used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood glucose levels , avoiding low levels ( hypoglycemia ) . Other means include the degradation of glycogen ( glycogenolysis ) and fatty acid catabolism . Gluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process , present in plants , animals , fungi , bacteria , and other microorganisms . In vertebrates , gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the liver and , to a lesser extent , in the cortex of the kidneys . In ruminants , this tends to be a continuous process . In many other animals , the process occurs during periods of fasting , starvation , low-carbohydrate diets , or intense exercise . The process is highly endergonic until it is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP or GTP , effectively making the process exergonic . For example , the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP to proceed spontaneously . Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis . Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type 2 diabetes , such as the antidiabetic drug , metformin , which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells .",

  "/wiki/Methylation": "In the chemical sciences , methylation denotes the addition of a methyl group on a substrate , or the substitution of an atom ( or group ) by a methyl group . Methylation is a form of alkylation , with a methyl group , rather than a larger carbon chain , replacing a hydrogen atom . These terms are commonly used in chemistry , biochemistry , soil science , and the biological sciences . In biological systems , methylation is catalyzed by enzymes ; such methylation can be involved in modification of heavy metals , regulation of gene expression , regulation of protein function , and RNA processing . In vitro methylation of tissue samples is also one method for reducing certain histological staining artifacts . The counterpart of methylation is called demethylation .",
  "/wiki/Cell_division": "Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells . Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle . In eukaryotes , there are two distinct types of cell division : a vegetative division , whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell ( mitosis ) , and a reproductive cell division , whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes ( meiosis ) . Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions . Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division , and sister chromatids are separated in the second division . Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle . Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor . Prokaryotes ( bacteria ) undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission , where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells . While binary fission may be the means of division by most prokaryotes , there are alternative manners of division , such as budding , that have been observed . All cell divisions , regardless of organism , are preceded by a single round of DNA replication . For simple unicellular microorganisms such as the amoeba , one cell division is equivalent to reproduction - an entire new organism is created . On a larger scale , mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms , such as plants that grow from cuttings .",
  "/wiki/Vitamin_B12": "Vitamin B12 , also known as cobalamin , is a water-soluble vitamin involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body : it is a cofactor in DNA synthesis , and in both fatty acid and amino acid metabolism . It is particularly important in the normal functioning of the nervous system via its role in the synthesis of myelin , and in the maturation of developing red blood cells in the bone marrow . Vitamin B12 is one of eight B vitamins ; it is the largest and most structurally complex vitamin . It consists of a class of chemically related compounds ( vitamers ) , all of which show physiological activity . It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt ( chemical symbol Co ) positioned in the center of a corrin ring . The only organisms to produce vitamin B12 are certain bacteria , and archaea . Some of these bacteria are found on plants that herbivores eat ; they are taken into the animal , proliferate and form part of their permanent gut flora , producing vitamin B12 internally . Most omnivorous people in developed countries obtain enough vitamin B12 from consuming animal products , including meat , milk , eggs , and fish . Grain-based foods are often fortified by having the vitamin added to them . Vitamin B12 supplements are available in single agent or multivitamin tablets . Pharmaceutical preparations may be given by intramuscular injection . Because there are few non-animal sources of the vitamin , vegans are advised to consume a dietary supplement or fortified foods for B12 intake , or risk serious health consequences .",

  "/wiki/Cyanocobalamin": "Cyanocobalamin is a manufactured form of vitamin B12 used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency . The deficiency may occur in pernicious anemia , following surgical removal of the stomach , with fish tapeworm , or due to bowel cancer . It is less preferred than hydroxocobalamin for treating vitamin B12 deficiency . It is used by mouth , by injection into a muscle , or as a nasal spray . Cyanocobalamin is generally well tolerated . Minor side effects may include diarrhea and itchiness . Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis , low blood potassium , and heart failure . Use is not recommended in those who are allergic to cobalt or have Leber 's disease . Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient meaning that it can not be made by the body but is required for life . Cyanocobalamin was first manufactured in the 1940s . It is available as a generic medication and over the counter . In the United Kingdom it costs the NHS about 2.90 \u00a3 per injection as of 2019 .",
  "/wiki/Methylcobalamin": "Methylcobalamin ( mecobalamin , MeCbl , or MeB12 ) is a cobalamin , a form of vitamin B12 . It differs from cyanocobalamin in that the cyano group at the cobalt is replaced with a methyl group . Methylcobalamin features an octahedral cobalt ( III ) centre and can be obtained as bright red crystals . From the perspective of coordination chemistry , methylcobalamin is notable as a rare example of a compound that contains metal-alkyl bonds . Nickel-methyl intermediates have been proposed for the final step of methanogenesis . Methylcobalamin is equivalent physiologically to vitamin B12 , and can be used to prevent or treat pathology arising from a lack of vitamin B12 intake ( vitamin B12 deficiency ) . Methylcobalamin is also used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy , diabetic neuropathy , and as a preliminary treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Methylcobalamin that is ingested is not used directly as a cofactor , but is first converted by MMACHC into cob ( II ) alamin . Cob ( II ) alamin is then later converted into the other 2 forms , adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin for use as cofactors . That is , methylcobalamin is first dealkylated and then regenerated . According to one author , it is important to treat vitamin B12 deficiency with hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin or a combination of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin , and not methylcobalamin alone .",
  "/wiki/Fatty_acid_metabolism": "Fatty acid metabolism consists of catabolic processes that generate energy , and anabolic processes that create biologically important molecules ( triglycerides , phospholipids , second messengers , local hormones and ketone bodies ) . Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO2 and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the plasma membrane and other membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones .",
  "/wiki/Amino_acid_metabolism": "Protein metabolism denotes the various biochemical processes responsible for the synthesis of proteins and amino acids ( anabolism ) , and the breakdown of proteins by catabolism . The steps of protein synthesis include transcription , translation , and post translational modifications . During transcription , RNA polymerase transcribes a coding region of the DNA in a cell producing a sequence of RNA , specifically messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . This mRNA sequence contains codons : 3 nucleotide long segments that code for a specific amino acid . Ribosomes translate the codons to their respective amino acids . In humans , non-essential amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in major metabolic pathways such as the Citric Acid Cycle . Essential amino acids must be consumed and are made in other organisms . The amino acids are joined by peptide bonds making a polypeptide chain . This polypeptide chain then goes through post translational modifications and is sometimes joined with other polypeptide chains to form a fully functional protein . Dietary proteins are first broken down to individual amino acids by various enzymes and hydrochloric acid present in the gastrointestinal tract . These amino acids are further broken down to \u03b1-keto acids which can be recycled in the body for generation of energy , and production of glucose or fat or other amino acids . Proteins can be broken down by enzymes known as peptidases or can break down as a result of denaturation ."
