Batman was not greenlit until after the success of Burton 's Beetlejuice ( 1988 ) . Numerous A-list actors were considered for the role of Batman before Keaton was cast . Keaton 's casting caused a controversy since , by 1988 , he had become typecast as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role . Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated top billing , a portion of the film 's earnings ( including associated merchandise ) , and his own shooting schedule . The tone and themes of the film were influenced in part by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland 's The Killing Joke and Frank Miller 's The Dark Knight Returns .
