  "/wiki/Colonnades_Leisure_Park": "The Colonnades Leisure Park ( also known as Croydon Colonnades ) is an out-of-town leisure park located in the Purley Way retail and industrial district of the London Borough of Croydon , South London . It opened in the late 1990s on the former site of the Croydon Water Palace , an indoor water park complex that operated from 1990 to 1996 . It lies alongside the Purley Way Playing Fields , and opposite the former Croydon Airport site . The Colonnades competes with the nearby Valley Park Retail Area , a main commercial area on Purley Way , but is less busy due to the lack of a notable anchor tenant - Valley Park has IKEA , while and Purley Way Centre has Sainsbury 's . Although The Colonnades centres itself as more of an entertainment complex than shopping area . The retail park is the southernmost of the three on the A23 Purley Way , and is close to Purley town centre . Most of the original outlets in the park were entertainment oriented , including City Limits , an indoor entertainment centre with a restaurant , sports bar , arcade and bowling facilities . The City Limits complex closed following the termination of their lease by owner Punch Taverns . Other original tenants included Gipsy Moth ( a family pub ) , the food court which used to house Subway , BBQ Xpress , China Wok and Karahi Cuisine . The Gypsy Moth site was demolished in 2018 to make way for a new multi-outlet retail unit , and in early 2019 McDonald 's and Nando 's were confirmed as tenants of two of the units . In 2010 it was announced that the retail park would include the first drive-through Costa Coffee outlet . This opened in 2015 ."
