Instead he chose to perform the triple loop , which was the first triple jump ever performed in international competition . He executed the jump without error and finished his skate cleanly , he was awarded perfect marks by the judges and won his second Olympic gold medal . The battle for second place was much closer and hotly contested between Helmut Seibt and James Grogan .",
