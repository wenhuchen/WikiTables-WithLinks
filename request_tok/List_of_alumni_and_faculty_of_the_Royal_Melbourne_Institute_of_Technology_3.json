  "/wiki/Typography": "Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible , readable , and appealing when displayed . The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces , point sizes , line lengths , line-spacing ( leading ) , and letter-spacing ( tracking ) , and adjusting the space between pairs of letters ( kerning ) . The term typography is also applied to the style , arrangement , and appearance of the letters , numbers , and symbols created by the process . Type design is a closely related craft , sometimes considered part of typography ; most typographers do not design typefaces , and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers . Typography also may be used as a decorative device , unrelated to communication of information . Typography is the work of typesetters ( also known as compositors ) , typographers , graphic designers , art directors , manga artists , comic book artists , graffiti artists , and , now , anyone who arranges words , letters , numbers , and symbols for publication , display , or distribution , from clerical workers and newsletter writers to anyone self-publishing materials . Until the Digital Age , typography was a specialized occupation . Digitization opened up typography to new generations of previously unrelated designers and lay users . As the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous , the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished . So at a time when scientific techniques can support the proven traditions ( e.g. , greater legibility with the use of serifs , upper and lower case , contrast , etc . ) through understanding the limitations of human vision , typography as often encountered may fail to achieve its principal objective : effective communication .",

Radford has announced his intention to lend out Old Masters ( European art , prior to the 19th century ) for long-term display to state galleries . He considers the collection of less than 30 paintings , put together by Mollison to give context to the modern collection , as too small to make any impact on the public .
