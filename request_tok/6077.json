  "/wiki/Mercenary": "A mercenary , sometimes known as a soldier of fortune , is an individual who takes part in military conflict for personal profit , is otherwise an outsider to the conflict , and is not a member of any other official military . Mercenaries fight for money or other forms of payment rather than for political interests . Beginning in the 20th century , mercenaries have increasingly come to be seen as less entitled to protections by rules of war than non-mercenaries . Indeed , the Geneva Conventions declare that mercenaries are not recognized as legitimate combatants and do not have to be granted the same legal protections as captured service personnel of a regular army . In practice , whether or not a person is a mercenary may be a matter of degree , as financial and political interests may overlap , as was often the case in all of history .",

  "/wiki/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal": "The Combatant Status Review Tribunals ( CSRT ) were a set of tribunals for confirming whether detainees held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had been correctly designated as enemy combatants . The CSRTs were established July 7 , 2004 by order of U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz after U.S. Supreme Court rulings in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld and Rasul v. Bush and were coordinated through the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants . These non-public hearings were conducted as a formal review of all the information related to a detainee to determine whether each person meets the criteria to be designated as an enemy combatant . The first CSRT hearings began in July 2004 . Redacted transcripts of hearings for high value detainees were posted to the Department of Defense ( DoD ) website . As of October 30 , 2007 , fourteen CSRT transcripts were available on the DoD website . The Supreme Court of the United States found these tribunals to be unconstitutional in Boumediene v. Bush .",
