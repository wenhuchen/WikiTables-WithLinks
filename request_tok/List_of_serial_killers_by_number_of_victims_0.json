Colombia is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea , the northwest by Panama , the south by both Ecuador and Peru , the east by Venezuela , the southeast by Brazil , and the west by the Pacific . It comprises thirty-two departments , with the capital in Bogot\u00e1 . Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona . Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law .",

The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century . The territory was colonized by Spain during the 16th century , achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia , from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 . The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador 's ethnically diverse population , with most of its 17.1 million people being mestizos , followed by large minorities of European , Amerindian , and African descendants . Spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population , though 13 Amerindian languages are also recognized , including Quichua and Shuar .

The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent .

The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries : Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Bolivia , Chile and Argentina . Along their length , the Andes are split into several ranges , separated by intermediate depressions . The Andes are the location of several high plateaus - some of which host major cities such as Quito , Bogot\u00e1 , Cali , Arequipa , Medell\u00edn , Bucaramanga , Sucre , M\u00e9rida and La Paz . The Altiplano plateau is the world 's second-highest after the Tibetan plateau . These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate : the Tropical Andes , the Dry Andes , and the Wet Andes . The Andes Mountains are the highest mountain range outside Asia . The highest mountain outside Asia , Argentina 's Mount Aconcagua , rises to an elevation of about 6,961 m ( 22,838 ft ) above sea level . The peak of Chimborazo in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth 's center than any other location on the Earth 's surface , due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the Earth 's rotation .

  "/wiki/Werewolf": "In folklore , a werewolf [ a ] ( Old English : werwulf , man-wolf ) , or occasionally lycanthrope /\u02c8la\u026ak\u0259n\u02cc\u03b8ro\u028ap/ ( Greek : \u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 luk\u00e1nthr\u014dpos , wolf-person ) , is a human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf ( or , especially in modern film , a therianthropic hybrid wolflike creature ) , either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction ( often a bite or scratch from another werewolf ) with the transformations occurring on the night of a full moon . Early sources for belief in this ability or affliction , called lycanthropy /la\u026a\u02c8k\u00e6n\u03b8r\u0259pi/ , are Petronius ( 27-66 ) and Gervase of Tilbury ( 1150-1228 ) . The werewolf is a widespread concept in European folklore , existing in many variants , which are related by a common development of a Christian interpretation of underlying European folklore developed during the medieval period . From the early modern period , werewolf beliefs also spread to the New World with colonialism . Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in witches , in the course of the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period . Like the witchcraft trials as a whole , the trial of supposed werewolves emerged in what is now Switzerland ( especially the Valais and Vaud ) in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th , peaking in the 17th and subsiding by the 18th century . The persecution of werewolves and the associated folklore is an integral part of the witch-hunt phenomenon , albeit a marginal one , accusations of lycanthropy being involved in only a small fraction of witchcraft trials . [ b ] During the early period , accusations of lycanthropy ( transformation into a wolf ) were mixed with accusations of wolf-riding or wolf-charming . The case of Peter Stumpp ( 1589 ) led to a significant peak in both interest in and persecution of supposed werewolves , primarily in French-speaking and German-speaking Europe . The phenomenon persisted longest in Bavaria and Austria , with persecution of wolf-charmers recorded until well after 1650 , the final cases taking place in the early 18th century in Carinthia and Styria . [ c ] After the end of the witch-trials , the werewolf became of interest in folklore studies and in the emerging Gothic horror genre ; werewolf fiction as a genre has pre-modern precedents in medieval romances ( e.g . Bisclavret and Guillaume de Palerme ) and developed in the 18th century out of the semi-fictional chap book tradition .",

The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

  "/wiki/South_Africa": "South Africa , officially the Republic of South Africa ( RSA ) , is the southernmost country in Africa . It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho . South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics ."
