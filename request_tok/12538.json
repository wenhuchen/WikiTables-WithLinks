Gillespie was a trumpet virtuoso and improviser , building on the virtuoso style of Roy Eldridge but adding layers of harmonic and rhythmic complexity previously unheard in jazz . His combination of musicianship , showmanship , and wit made him a leading popularizer of the new music called bebop . His beret and horn-rimmed spectacles , his scat singing , his bent horn , pouched cheeks , and his light-hearted personality provided some of bebop 's most prominent symbols . In the 1940s Gillespie , with Charlie Parker , became a major figure in the development of bebop and modern jazz . He taught and influenced many other musicians , including trumpeters Miles Davis , Jon Faddis , Fats Navarro , Clifford Brown , Arturo Sandoval , Lee Morgan , Chuck Mangione , and balladeer Johnny Hartman . Scott Yanow wrote , Dizzy Gillespie 's contributions to jazz were huge . One of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time , Gillespie was such a complex player that his contemporaries ended up being similar to those of Miles Davis and Fats Navarro instead , and it was not until Jon Faddis 's emergence in the 1970s that Dizzy 's style was successfully recreated [ . ] Arguably Gillespie is remembered , by both critics and fans alike , as one of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time .",
