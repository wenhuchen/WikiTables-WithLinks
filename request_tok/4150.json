It is the highest mountain in Siberia ( Asian Russia ) . Its steep , symmetrical cone towers about 100 kilometres ( 60 mi ) from the Bering Sea . The volcano is part of the natural Volcanoes of Kamchatka UNESCO World Heritage Site . Klyuchevskaya appeared 6,000 years ago . Its first recorded eruption occurred in 1697 , and it has been almost continuously active ever since , as have many of its neighboring volcanoes . It was first climbed in 1788 by Daniel Gauss and two other members of the Billings Expedition . No other ascents were recorded until 1931 , when several climbers were killed by flying lava on the descent . As similar dangers still exist today , few ascents are made . Klyuchevskaya Sopka is considered sacred by some indigenous peoples , being viewed by them as the location at which the world was created . Other volcanoes in the region are seen with similar spiritual significance , but Klyuchevskaya Sopka is the most sacred of these .",

Rossiya , IPA : [ r\u0250\u02c8s\u02b2ij\u0259 ] ) , or the Russian Federation , [ e ] is a European country located in Eastern Europe with a vast expanse of territory that stretches across Northern Asia . At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations . The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",

It is the southernmost active volcano of Kamchatka . It has erupted mafic rocks . It has a summit crater as well as five cinder cones on its flanks which are the source of lava flows . The volcano probably formed during the early Holocene and aside from the summit crater also features an explosion crater on the southwestern side of the summit . Three large collapses of the edifice occurred around 6300 BP ; between the first two volcanic activity restored the cone , while the third occurred on the ridge on which Kambalny was constructed . The longest of these landslides travelled 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) . The total volume of these landslides , 5-10 cubic kilometres ( 1.2-2.4 cu mi ) , is the largest of all Holocene landslides , but it was buried at Kambalny proper by later volcanic activity . The collapse scar in the ridge is still visible and was the site of later landslides when Kambalny volcano was active . Kambalny is part of a group of volcanoes from the late Pleistocene and the Holocene that surround the Kurile Lake caldera . Other volcanoes in that group are Diky Greben , Ilyinsky , Koshelev and Zheltovsky . Kambalny itself is constructed on a ridge which formed in the Quaternary during the uplift of the central part of a trough .",
