Standing at 1,345 metres ( 4,411 ft ) above sea level , it is at the western end of the Grampian Mountains in the Lochaber area of the Scottish Highlands , close to the town of Fort William . The mountain is a popular destination , attracting an estimated 100,000 ascents a year , around three-quarters of which use the Pony Track from Glen Nevis . The 700-metre ( 2,300 ft ) cliffs of the north face are among the highest in Scotland , providing classic scrambles and rock climbs of all difficulties for climbers and mountaineers . They are also the principal locations in Scotland for ice climbing . The summit , which is the collapsed dome of an ancient volcano , features the ruins of an observatory which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904 . The meteorological data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather . C. T. R. Wilson was inspired to invent the cloud chamber after a period spent working at the observatory .",
  "/wiki/Aberdeenshire_(historic)": "Aberdeenshire or the County of Aberdeen ( Scots : Coontie o Aiberdeen , Scottish Gaelic : Siorrachd Obar Dheathain ) is a historic county and registration county of Scotland . The area of the county , excluding the city of Aberdeen itself , is also a lieutenancy area . The county borders Kincardineshire , Angus and Perthshire to the south , Inverness-shire and Banffshire to the west , and the North Sea to the north and east . It has a coast-line of 65 miles ( 105 km ) . Between 1890 and 1975 , Aberdeenshire was one of the administrative counties of Scotland , governed by a county council . In 1900 , the county town of Aberdeen became a county of a city and was thus removed from the administrative county . In 1975 the Local Government ( Scotland ) Act 1973 reorganised local administration in Scotland into a two-tier system of regions and districts . The administrative counties of Aberdeenshire , the City of Aberdeen , Banffshire , Kincardineshire and most of Morayshire were merged to form Grampian Region , with the area of county being divided between the districts of City of Aberdeen , Banff and Buchan , Gordon and Kincardine and Deeside for administration . In 1996 Scottish local government system was reorganised a second time to form a single tier of unitary council areas . The name was revived in local government for the council area of Aberdeenshire , which has vastly different boundaries . The area is generally hilly , and from the south-west , near the centre of Scotland , the Grampians send out various branches , mostly to the north-east .",
  "/wiki/Ben_Macdhui_(Scotland)": "Ben Macdui ( Scottish Gaelic : Beinn Mac Duibh ) is the second highest mountain in the United Kingdom ( in absolute height ) after Ben Nevis , and the highest in the Cairngorms National Park . After the defeat of Domnall mac Uilliam in 1187 , Donnchad II , Earl of Fife , acquired Strathavon , a territory stretching from Ballindalloch to Ben Macdui ; because the mountain marked the western boundary of Donnchad 's territory , historian and place-name scholar Professor G.W.S . Barrow has suggested that the mountain took its name from Donnchad 's family , the Mac Duibh . Ben Macdui lies on the southern edge of the Cairn Gorm plateau , on the boundary between Aberdeenshire and Moray . Probably the easiest route of ascent is from the Coire Cas car park at the foot of Cairngorm Ski Centre by a path that leads up over slowly rising moorland . This route is about 7 km ( 4 mi ) long ; a somewhat longer route allows one also to climb Cairn Gorm . One possible alternative route follows the path coming up from Loch Etchachan . This loch may be reached from Loch Avon to the north or by coming up from Glen Derry to the south . Other routes include coming over Derry Cairngorm , or via the Lairig Ghru pass , which lies to the west of Ben Macdui . Nearly all these routes are long days by Scottish standards . [ clarification needed ] When coming from the south it is common to use a bicycle to cover the 5 km ( 3\u00bd mi ) from the road end at Linn of Dee to Derry Lodge at the southern end of the massif . Before the production of accurate maps of Scotland in the 19th century it was not known for certain that Ben Nevis was the highest point in Britain , and it was often thought that Ben Macdui might be the higher .",

  "/wiki/Ben_Lawers": "Ben Lawers ( Scottish Gaelic : Beinn Labhair ) is the highest mountain in the southern part of the Scottish Highlands . It lies to the north of Loch Tay , and is the highest point of a long ridge that includes seven Munros . It is the highest peak in Perthshire , and is the tenth highest Munro in Scotland . Ben Lawers was long thought to be over 4,000 feet ( 1,219.2 m ) in height ; accurate measurement in the 1870s showed it to be some 17 feet ( 5.2 m ) short of this figure . Ben Lawers lies on the watershed between the rivers Tay and Lyon . Since the 1950s , water has been captured from the numerous burns on the south face of Ben Lawers and Meall nan Tarmachan as part of the Breadalbane Hydro-Electric Scheme . The water is diverted to the Lochan na Lairige , from where it is piped to drive hydro-electric turbines at Finlarig on the banks of Loch Tay . The level of the Lochan na Lairige was raised by the construction of the 344 metre-long Lawers Dam , a buttress-type dam that is 42 m high . Due to the height of this reservoir the static head of water is 415 m , the highest available on any hydro-electric scheme in Scotland . Due to its high altitude and underlying geology Ben Lawers is home to an exceptionally rich selection of arctic-alpine plant species and habitats , and has been designated as a National Nature Reserve ( NNR ) since 1964 .",
  "/wiki/Ross_and_Cromarty": "Ross and Cromarty ( Scottish Gaelic : Ros agus Cromba ) , sometimes referred to as Ross-shire and Cromartyshire is a variously defined area in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland . There is a registration county and a lieutenancy area in current use , the latter of which is 8,019 square kilometres ( 3,096 square miles ) in extent . Historically there has also been a constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ( 1832 to 1983 ) , a local government county ( 1890 to 1975 ) , a district of the Highland local government region ( 1975 to 1996 ) and a management area of the Highland Council ( 1996 to 2007 ) . The local government county is now divided between two local government areas : the Highland area and Na h-Eileanan Siar ( the Western Isles ) . Ross and Cromarty border Sutherland to the north and Inverness-shire to the south . The county was formed by the uniting of the shires of Ross-shire and Cromartyshire . Both these shires had themselves been formed from the historic province of Ross , out of which the many enclaves and exclaves that formed Cromartyshire were carved out , leaving the remaining area to become Ross-shire . These parcels of land were for many purposes administered as part of Ross-shire rather than Cromartyshire . The county also included the Isle of Lewis , however this is not part of the modern lieutenancy area ( which instead includes the Isle of Skye ) , although Lewis is part of the current registration county .",

  "/wiki/Bidean_nam_Bian": "Bidean nam Bian , lying to the south of Glen Coe , Highland , Scotland , is the highest point in the former county of Argyll . It is a complex mountain , with many ridges and subsidiary peaks , one of which , Stob Coire Sgreamhach , is classified as a separate Munro . The most noticeable features of Bidean nam Bian are the famous Three Sisters of Glen Coe , three steeply-sided ridges that extend north into the Glen . Two of the sisters , Gearr Aonach ( Short Ridge ) and Aonach Dubh ( Black Ridge ) converge at Stob Coire nan Lochan , a 1,115 m ( 3,658 feet ) subsidiary peak of Bidean nam Bian that lies about 1 km to the northeast of the actual summit . The final , most easterly sister , Beinn Fhada ( Long Hill ) , joins the Bidean nam Bian massif at the summit of Stob Coire Sgreamhach . Beinn Fhada is separated from Gearr Aonach by a glen known as Coire Gabhail . This can translate to Glen of Capture , however the glen is more normally known as the Hidden or Lost Valley , as it has a wide flat area concealed from Glen Coe by the landslip which blocked the entrance and allowed a loch to form . The valley was used by Clan Macdonald to hide their livestock from raiders , or hide cattle they themselves had stolen . The steep rough path up from Glen Coe skirts a wooded ravine , and is a popular short walk ( around 4 kilometres ( 2.5 mi ) in total ) , though it involves a river crossing and some rocky sections .",

Sutherland borders Caithness and Moray Firth to the east , Ross-shire and Cromartyshire ( later combined into Ross and Cromarty ) to the south and the Atlantic to the north and west . Like its southern neighbour Ross-shire , Sutherland has some of the most dramatic scenery in the whole of Europe , especially on its western fringe where the mountains meet the sea . These include high sea cliffs , and very old mountains composed of Precambrian and Cambrian rocks . The name Sutherland dates from the era of Norwegian Viking rule and settlement over much of the Highlands and Islands , under the rule of the jarl of Orkney . Although it contains some of the northernmost land in the island of Great Britain , it was called Su\u00f0rland ( southern land ) from the standpoint of Orkney and Caithness . In Gaelic , the area is referred to according to its traditional areas : D\u00f9thaich MhicAoidh ( or D\u00f9thaich 'IcAoidh ) in the northeast , Asainte ( Assynt ) in the west , and Cataibh in the east . Cataibh is also sometimes used to refer to the area as a whole . The northwest corner of Sutherland , traditionally known as the Province of Strathnaver , was not incorporated into Sutherland until 1601 . This was the home of the powerful and warlike Clan Mackay , and as such was named in Gaelic , D\u00f9thaich 'Ic Aoidh , the Homeland of Mackay . Even today this part of Sutherland is known as Mackay Country , and , unlike other areas of Scotland where the names traditionally associated with the area have become diluted , there is still a preponderance of Mackays in the D\u00f9thaich .",

Dunbartonshire borders Perthshire to the north , Stirlingshire to the east , Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire to the south , and Argyllshire to the west . The boundaries with Lanarkshire and Stirlingshire are split in two owing to the existence of an exclave around Cumbernauld ( see below ) . Prior to 1975 , the county was also used for local government with its own county council , its administrative centre being at the town of Dumbarton . Under the 1973 Local Government ( Scotland ) Act , the county council was abolished and administration was transferred to the newly formed Strathclyde council region . When Strathclyde was itself dissolved in 1996 , the term Dunbartonshire resurfaced in local administration in the names of the new council areas of East Dunbartonshire and West Dunbartonshire .

There are three small summits around 800 m apart along the main ridge ; the central one is the highest , though the southern one has a trig point . Unlike many Scottish peaks , there is no single route up Ben Vorlich that is used to the virtual exclusion of all other . Most walkers elect to follow one of the ridges : several points on the southern ridge may be reached by way of the track leading to Loch Sloy , the Little Hills can be climbed from Ardvorlich on the lochside and an ascent of the northern ridge is usually commenced from a point between Ardlui and Inverarnan .",

In earlier times it had considerably greater boundaries , including neighbouring Renfrewshire until 1402 . Lanarkshire is bounded to the north by Stirlingshire and Dunbartonshire ( this boundary is split into two sections owing to Dunbartonshire 's Cumbernauld exclave ) , to the northeast by West Lothian and Mid Lothian , to the east by Peeblesshire , to the south by Dumfriesshire , and to the west by Ayrshire and Renfrewshire .",
  "/wiki/Culter_Fell": "Culter Fell is a hill in the Southern Uplands of Scotland . It is the county top of the historic county of Lanarkshire , as well as the highest point in South Lanarkshire council area . It is the culmination of a network of ridges that lie south of the village of Coulter , close to the town of Biggar . It is probably most easily climbed from the north west . The best starting point is the mouth of Kings Beck , at NT 031305 . Earlier OSGB topographic maps show a public road at this location , but the most recent maps show only a private road , and there are notices threatening to remove unauthorised vehicles . Cars should therefore be parked at Birthwood , 500 metres further back . It is tempting to walk up the track leading up the Kings Beck , but the direct route up the north west ridge is much easier . The slope is smooth and dry , the vegetation is short , and although there is no constructed footpath , helpful steps have been cut by the boots of previous climbers . There is an alternative starting point at Glenkirk , to the east ( NT077295 ) . From here , a circular route along a ridge including Chapelgill Hill is among several additional options . There is extensive sheep farming and sporting activity in the area , so care should be taken when accessing Culter Fell in the spring or late summer .",
  "/wiki/Roxburghshire": "Roxburghshire or the County of Roxburgh is a historic county and registration county in the Southern Uplands of Scotland . It borders Dumfriesshire to the west , Selkirkshire and Midlothian to the north-west , and Berwickshire to the north . To the south-west it borders Cumberland and to the south-east Northumberland , both in England . It was named after the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh , a town which declined markedly in the 15th century and is no longer in existence . Latterly , the county town of Roxburghshire was Jedburgh . The county has much the same area as Teviotdale , the basin drained by the River Teviot and tributaries together with the adjacent stretch of the Tweed into which it flows . The term is often treated as synonymous with Roxburghshire , but may omit Liddesdale as Liddel Water drains to the west coast .",
