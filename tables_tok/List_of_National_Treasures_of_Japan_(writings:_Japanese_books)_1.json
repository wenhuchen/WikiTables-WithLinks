  "section_text": "One of the earliest kana materials and one of the oldest extant works of Japanese prose fiction is the Tosa Diary written by Ki no Tsurayuki in 935 . [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] It is also the oldest Japanese travel diary , giving an account of a return journey to Kyoto after a four-year term as prefect of Tosa Province . [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] The diary consists of close to 60 poems , [ nb 10 ] connected by prose sections that detail the circumstances and the inspiration for the composition of the poems . [ 24 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] The work has been valued as a model for composition in the Japanese style . [ 100 ] The original manuscript by Ki no Tsurayuki had been stored at Renge\u014d-in palace library , and later was in the possession of Ashikaga Yoshimasa , after which its trace is lost . [ 6 ] All surviving manuscripts of the Tosa Diary are copies of this Renge\u014d-in manuscript . [ 101 ] The oldest extant of these , by Fujiwara no Teika , dates to 1235 . One year later his son , Fujiwara no Tameie , produced another copy based on the original . Both transcriptions are complete facsimiles of the original , inclusive of the text , the layout , orthographical usages , and calligraphy . [ nb 11 ] [ 101 ] They have been designated as National Treasures . [ 4 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_National_Treasures_of_Japan_(writings:_Japanese_books)_1",
  "intro": "The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897,\nalthough the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The written materials in the list adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value. Writing was introduced from Korea to Japan around 400 AD (in the form of Chinese books), with work done in Chinese by immigrant scribes from the mainland. [nb 1] Literacy remained at an extremely marginal level in the 5th and 6th centuries, but during the 7th century a small number of Japanese scholar-aristocrats such as Prince Sh\u014dtoku began to write in Chinese for official purposes and in order to promote Buddhism. By the late 7th century, reading and writing had become an integral part of life of some sections of the ruling and intellectual classes, particularly in government and religion. The earliest extant large-scale works compiled in Japan are the historical chronicles Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720). Other early Japanese works from the Nara period include biographies of Prince Sh\u014dtoku, cultural and geographical records (fudoki) and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, the first anthology of Japanese poetry. Necessarily all of these works were either written in Chinese or in a hybrid Japanese-Chinese style and were modeled on Chinese prototypes. The development of a distinct Japanese script (kana) in the 9th century was the starting point of the classical age of Japanese literature and led to a number of new, uniquely Japanese genres of literature, such as tales (monogatari) or diaries (nikki). Because of the strong interest and support in literature of the Heian court, writing activities flourished particularly in the 10th and 11th centuries. This list contains books of various type that have been compiled in Classical and early Feudal Japan."
