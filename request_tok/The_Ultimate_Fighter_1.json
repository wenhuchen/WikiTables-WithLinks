He has been champion since December 29 , 2018 , and previously held the title from March 20 , 2011 , to April 28 , 2015 . Jones also held the interim UFC Light Heavyweight Championship . As of August 19 , 2019 , he is # 1 in the UFC men 's pound-for-pound rankings . At age 23 , with his victory over Maur\u00edcio Rua in 2011 , Jones became the youngest champion since the UFC instituted weight classes . He holds many UFC records in the light heavyweight division , including the most title defenses , most wins , longest win streak , and most submission victories . During much of his championship reign , Jones has been widely considered to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world . Never stopped nor outscored during his career , Jones 's only professional loss is a controversial disqualification against Matt Hamill , a result that Hamill and UFC President Dana White dispute . Between 2015 and 2017 , Jones was involved in several controversies and lost his title three times time as a result of disciplinary action . He was first stripped of his title and removed from the official rankings by the UFC in 2015 after he was arrested on felony hit-and-run charges . His subsequent returns to the UFC in 2016 and 2017 saw him emerge victorious in title bouts against Ovince Saint Preux and Daniel Cormier , but were both cut short by Jones testing positive for banned substances and receiving further suspensions , with the latter reversed to a 'no contest ' .",
