  "/wiki/Cystitis": "A urinary tract infection ( UTI ) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract . When it affects the lower urinary tract it is known as a bladder infection ( cystitis ) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as a kidney infection ( pyelonephritis ) . Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include pain with urination , frequent urination , and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder . Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI . Rarely the urine may appear bloody . In the very old and the very young , symptoms may be vague or non-specific . The most common cause of infection is Escherichia coli , though other bacteria or fungi may sometimes be the cause . Risk factors include female anatomy , sexual intercourse , diabetes , obesity , and family history . Although sexual intercourse is a risk factor , UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) . Kidney infection , if it occurs , usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood-borne infection . Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone . In those with vague symptoms , diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection .",

It is best known as the cause of infectious mononucleosis ( mono or glandular fever ) . It is also associated with various non-malignant , premalignant , and malignant Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases such as Burkitt lymphoma , hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis , and Hodgkin 's lymphoma ; non-lymphoid malignancies such as gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma ; and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus such as hairy leukoplakia and central nervous system lymphomas . The virus is also associated with the childhood disorders of Alice in Wonderland syndrome and acute cerebellar ataxia and , based on some evidence , higher risks of developing certain autoimmune diseases , especially dermatomyositis , systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , Sj\u00f6gren 's syndrome , and multiple sclerosis . About 200,000 cancer cases per year are thought to be attributable to EBV . Infection with EBV occurs by the oral transfer of saliva and genital secretions . Most people become infected with EBV and gain adaptive immunity . In the United States , about half of all five-year-old children and about 90% of adults have evidence of previous infection . Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears . Many children become infected with EBV , and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild , brief illnesses of childhood . In the United States and other developed countries , many people are not infected with EBV in their childhood years . When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence , it causes infectious mononucleosis 35 to 50% of the time .",
  "/wiki/Herpesviridae": "Herpesviridae is a large family of DNA viruses that cause infections and certain diseases in animals , including humans . The members of this family are also known as herpesviruses . The family name is derived from the Greek word herpein ( to creep ) , referring to spreading cutaneous lesions , usually involving blisters , seen in flares of herpes simplex 1 , herpes simplex 2 and herpes zoster ( shingles ) . In 1971 , the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) established Herpesvirus as a genus with 23 viruses among four groups . Latent , recurring infections are typical of this group of viruses , though the family name does not refer to latency . Herpesviridae can cause latent or lytic infections . At least five species of the Herpesviridae - HSV-1 and HSV-2 ( both of which can cause orolabial herpes and genital herpes ) , varicella zoster virus ( the cause of chickenpox and shingles ) , Epstein-Barr virus ( implicated in several diseases , including mononucleosis and some cancers ) , and cytomegalovirus - are extremely widespread among humans . More than 90% of adults have been infected with at least one of these , and a latent form of the virus remains in almost all humans who have been infected . Nine herpesvirus types are known to infect humans : herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 ( HSV-1 and HSV-2 , also known as HHV1 and HHV2 ) , varicella-zoster virus ( VZV , which may also be called by its ICTV name , HHV-3 ) , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV or HHV-4 ) , human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV or HHV-5 ) , human herpesvirus 6A and 6B ( HHV-6A and HHV-6B ) , human herpesvirus 7 ( HHV-7 ) , and Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV , also known as HHV-8 ) .

Most people are infected by the virus as children , when the disease produces few or no symptoms . In young adults , the disease often results in fever , sore throat , enlarged lymph nodes in the neck , and tiredness . Most people recover in two to four weeks ; however , feeling tired may last for months . The liver or spleen may also become swollen , and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur . While usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus , also known as human herpesvirus 4 , which is a member of the herpes virus family , a few other viruses may also cause the disease . It is primarily spread through saliva but can rarely be spread through semen or blood . Spread may occur by objects such as drinking glasses or toothbrushes or through a cough or sneeze . Those who are infected can spread the disease weeks before symptoms develop . Mono is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms and can be confirmed with blood tests for specific antibodies . Another typical finding is increased blood lymphocytes of which more than 10% are atypical . The monospot test is not recommended for general use due to poor accuracy .",

Those affected may feel tired or be itchy . There are two major types of Hodgkin lymphoma : classical Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma . About half of cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are due to Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) and these are generally the classic form . Other risk factors include a family history of the condition and having HIV/AIDS . Diagnosis is by finding Hodgkin cells such as multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells ( RS cells ) in lymph nodes . The virus-positive cases are classified as a form of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases . Hodgkin lymphoma may be treated with chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and stem cell transplant .

  "/wiki/Immunoglobulin": "An antibody ( Ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a large , Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses . The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen , called an antigen , via the fragment antigen-binding ( Fab ) variable region . Each tip of the Y of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by inhibiting a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . Depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region ( located at the base of the Y ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions . The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system . Antibodies are secreted by B cells of the adaptive immune system , mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells . Antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma , and a membrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B-cell receptor ( BCR ) . The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure . In most cases , interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding . Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms .",

A lean 70 kg ( 160 pound ) man , for example , has about 42 ( 42-47 ) liters of water in his body . The total body of water is divided between the intracellular fluid ( ICF ) compartment ( also called space , or volume ) and the extracellular fluid ( ECF ) compartment ( space , volume ) in a two-to-one ratio : 28 ( 28-32 ) liters are inside cells and 14 ( 14-15 ) liters are outside cells . The ECF compartment is divided into the interstitial fluid volume - the fluid outside both the cells and the blood vessels - and the intravascular volume ( also called the vascular volume and blood plasma volume ) - the fluid inside the blood vessels - in a three-to-one ratio : the interstitial fluid volume is about 12 liters , the vascular volume is about 4 liters . The interstitial fluid compartment is divided into the lymphatic fluid compartment - about 2/3 's , or 8 ( 6-10 ) liters ; the transcellular fluid compartment is the remaining 1/3 , or about 4 liters .

  "/wiki/Cirrhosis": "Cirrhosis , also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis , is a condition in which the liver does not function properly due to long-term damage . This damage is characterized by the replacement of normal liver tissue by scar tissue . Typically , the disease develops slowly over months or years . Early on , there are often no symptoms . As the disease worsens , a person may become tired , weak , itchy , have swelling in the lower legs , develop yellow skin , bruise easily , have fluid build up in the abdomen , or develop spider-like blood vessels on the skin . The fluid build-up in the abdomen may become spontaneously infected . Other serious complications include hepatic encephalopathy , bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus or dilated stomach veins , and liver cancer . Hepatic encephalopathy results in confusion and may lead to unconsciousness . Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcohol , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Typically , more than two or three alcoholic drinks per day over a number of years is required for alcoholic cirrhosis to occur . Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has a number of causes , including being overweight , diabetes , high blood fats , and high blood pressure .

  "/wiki/Spleen": "The spleen is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates . Similar in structure to a large lymph node , it acts primarily as a blood filter . The word spleen comes from Ancient Greek \u03c3\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd ( spl\u1e17n ) . The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) and the immune system . It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood , which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock , and also recycles iron . As a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system , it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) . The globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids , and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin , which is removed in the liver . The spleen synthesizes antibodies in its white pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation . A study published in 2009 using mice found that the red pulp of the spleen forms a reservoir that contains over half of the body 's monocytes . These monocytes , upon moving to injured tissue ( such as the heart after myocardial infarction ) , turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing . The spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system and is analogous to a large lymph node , as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections . In humans the spleen is purple in color and is in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen .",

Mutations that result solely in microcephaly ( primary microcephaly ) exist but are less common . External toxins to the embryo , such as alcohol during pregnancy or vertically transmitted infections , can also result in microcephaly . Microcephaly serves as an important neurological indication or warning sign , but no uniformity exists in its definition .

  "/wiki/HIV": "The human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIV ) are two species of Lentivirus ( a subgroup of retrovirus ) that infect humans . Over time they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive . Without treatment , average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years , depending on the HIV subtype . In most cases , HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood , pre-ejaculate , semen , and vaginal fluids . Research has shown ( for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples ) that HIV is untransmissable through condomless sexual intercourse if the HIV-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load . Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy , during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid , and through breast milk . Within these bodily fluids , HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells . HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system , such as helper T cells ( specifically CD4+ T cells ) , macrophages , and dendritic cells . HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms , including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells , apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells , direct viral killing of infected cells , and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells . When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level , cell-mediated immunity is lost , and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections , leading to the development of AIDS .",
  "/wiki/Retroviridae": "A retrovirus is a type of RNA virus that inserts a copy of its genome into the DNA of a host cell that it invades , thus changing the genome of that cell . Once inside the host cell 's cytoplasm , the virus uses its own reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome , the reverse of the usual pattern , thus retro ( backwards ) . The new DNA is then incorporated into the host cell genome by an integrase enzyme , at which point the retroviral DNA is referred to as a provirus . The host cell then treats the viral DNA as part of its own genome , transcribing and translating the viral genes along with the cell 's own genes , producing the proteins required to assemble new copies of the virus . It is difficult to detect the virus until it has infected the host . At that point , the infection will persist indefinitely . In most viruses , DNA is transcribed into RNA , and then RNA is translated into protein . However , retroviruses function differently , as their RNA is reverse-transcribed into DNA , which is integrated into the host cell 's genome ( when it becomes a provirus ) , and then undergoes the usual transcription and translational processes to express the genes carried by the virus . The information contained in a retroviral gene is thus used to generate the corresponding protein via the sequence : RNA \u2192 DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 polypeptide . This extends the fundamental process identified by Francis Crick ( one gene-one peptide ) in which the sequence is DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 peptide ( proteins are made of one or more polypeptide chains ; for example , haemoglobin is a four-chain peptide ) . Retroviruses are valuable research tools in molecular biology , and they have been used successfully in gene delivery systems .",
  "/wiki/Blood": "Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells . In vertebrates , it is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma . Plasma , which constitutes 55% of blood fluid , is mostly water ( 92% by volume ) , and contains proteins , glucose , mineral ions , hormones , carbon dioxide ( plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation ) , and blood cells themselves . Albumin is the main protein in plasma , and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood . The blood cells are mainly red blood cells ( also called RBCs or erythrocytes ) , white blood cells ( also called WBCs or leukocytes ) and platelets ( also called thrombocytes ) . The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells . These contain hemoglobin , an iron-containing protein , which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood . In contrast , carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma . Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated . Some animals , such as crustaceans and mollusks , use hemocyanin to carry oxygen , instead of hemoglobin . Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood , the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system . In most insects , this blood does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen .",

Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms , or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness . Typically , this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms . If the infection progresses , it interferes more with the immune system , increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis , as well as other opportunistic infections , and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function . These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss . HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex ( including anal and oral sex ) , contaminated blood transfusions , hypodermic needles , and from mother to child during pregnancy , delivery , or breastfeeding . Some bodily fluids , such as saliva , sweat and tears , do not transmit the virus . HIV is a member of the group of viruses known as retroviruses . Methods of prevention include safe sex , needle exchange programs , treating those who are infected , pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis , and male circumcision . Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication .

HAART decreases the patient 's total burden of HIV , maintains function of the immune system , and prevents opportunistic infections that often lead to death . HAART also prevents the transmission of HIV between serodiscordant same sex and opposite sex partners so long as the HIV-positive partner maintains an undetectable viral load . Treatment has been so successful that in many parts of the world , HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare . Anthony Fauci , head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , has written , With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come , an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach . In the same paper , he noted that an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone by antiretroviral therapy . As another commentary in The Lancet noted , Rather than dealing with acute and potentially life-threatening complications , clinicians are now confronted with managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades . The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization recommend offering antiretroviral treatment to all patients with HIV . Because of the complexity of selecting and following a regimen , the potential for side effects , and the importance of taking medications regularly to prevent viral resistance , such organizations emphasize the importance of involving patients in therapy choices and recommend analyzing the risks and the potential benefits . The World Health Organization has defined health as more than the absence of disease .",

The most common symptoms include : high fever , runny nose , sore throat , muscle and joint pain , headache , coughing , and feeling tired . These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week . The cough , however , may last for more than two weeks . In children , there may be diarrhea and vomiting , but these are not common in adults . Diarrhea and vomiting occur more commonly in gastroenteritis , which is an unrelated disease and sometimes inaccurately referred to as stomach flu or the 24-hour flu . Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia , secondary bacterial pneumonia , sinus infections , and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure . Three of the four types of influenza viruses affect humans : Type A , Type B , and Type C. Type D has not been known to infect humans , but is believed to have the potential to do so . Usually , the virus is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes . This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances . It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the eyes , nose , or mouth .",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) recommends that clinicians use their discretion to treat those at lower risk who present within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection . It is taken by mouth , either as a pill or liquid . Recommendations regarding oseltamivir are controversial as are criticisms of the recommendations . A 2014 Cochrane Review concluded that oseltamivir does not reduce hospitalizations , and that there is no evidence of reduction in complications of influenza . Two meta-analyses have concluded that benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not outweigh its risks . They also found little evidence regarding whether treatment changes the risk of hospitalization or death in high risk populations .

  "/wiki/Postinfectious_encephalomyelitis": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ( ADEM ) , or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis , is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden , widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord . As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed , ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation , which , as a result , destroys the white matter . It is often triggered by a viral infection or , perhaps exceedingly rarely specific non-routine vaccinations . ADEM 's symptoms resemble the symptoms of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases . However , ADEM has several features that distinguish it from MS . Unlike MS , ADEM occurs usually in children and is marked with rapid fever , although adolescents and adults can get the disease too . ADEM consists of a single flare-up whereas MS is marked with several flare-ups ( or relapses ) , over a long period of time . Relapses following ADEM are reported in up to a quarter of patients , but the majority of these 'multiphasic ' presentations following ADEM likely represent MS. ADEM is also distinguished by a loss of consciousness , coma and death , which is very rare in MS , except in severe cases . It affects about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year . Although it occurs in all ages , most reported cases are in children and adolescents , with the average age around 5 to 8 years old . The disease affects males and females almost equally . ADEM shows seasonal variation with higher incidence in winter and spring months which may coincide with higher viral infections during these months .",

Several hundred species of papillomaviruses , traditionally referred to as types , have been identified infecting all carefully inspected mammals , but also other vertebrates such as birds , snakes , turtles and fish . Infection by most papillomavirus types , depending on the type , is either asymptomatic ( e.g . most Beta-PVs ) or causes small benign tumors , known as papillomas or warts ( e.g . human papillomavirus 1 , HPV6 or HPV11 ) . Papillomas caused by some types , however , such as human papillomaviruses 16 and 18 , carry a risk of becoming cancerous . Papillomaviruses are usually considered as highly host- and tissue-tropic , and are thought to rarely be transmitted between species . Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in the basal layer of the body surface tissues . All known papillomavirus types infect a particular body surface , typically the skin or mucosal epithelium of the genitals , anus , mouth , or airways . For example , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) type 1 tends to infect the soles of the feet , and HPV type 2 the palms of the hands , where they may cause warts . Additionally , there are descriptions of the presence of papillomavirus DNA in the blood and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells .

The tumors may lead to narrowing of the airway , which may cause vocal changes or airway obstruction . Laryngeal papillomatosis is initially diagnosed through indirect laryngoscopy upon observation of growths on the larynx and can be confirmed through a biopsy . Treatment for laryngeal papillomatosis aims to remove the papillomas and limit their recurrence . Due to the recurrent nature of the virus , repeated treatments usually are needed . Laryngeal papillomatosis is primarily treated surgically , though supplemental nonsurgical and/or medical treatments may be considered in some cases . The evolution of laryngeal papillomatosis is highly variable . Though total recovery may be observed , it is often persistent despite treatment .

In a typical scenario , a virus-infected cell will release interferons causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral defenses . IFNs belong to the large class of proteins known as cytokines , molecules used for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system that help eradicate pathogens . Interferons are named for their ability to interfere with viral replication by protecting cells from virus infections . IFNs also have various other functions : they activate immune cells , such as natural killer cells and macrophages ; they increase host defenses by up-regulating antigen presentation by virtue of increasing the expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) antigens . Certain symptoms of infections , such as fever , muscle pain and flu-like symptoms , are also caused by the production of IFNs and other cytokines . More than twenty distinct IFN genes and proteins have been identified in animals , including humans . They are typically divided among three classes : Type I IFN , Type II IFN , and Type III IFN .

Poliovirus is composed of an RNA genome and a protein capsid . The genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is about 7500 nucleotides long . The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry . Because of its short genome and its simple composition - only RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral protein coat that encapsulates it , poliovirus is widely regarded as the simplest significant virus . Poliovirus was first isolated in 1909 by Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper . The structure of the virus was first elucidated using x-ray diffraction by a team at Birkbeck College led by Rosalind Franklin , showing that the polio virus to have icosahedral symmetry . In 1981 , the poliovirus genome was published by two different teams of researchers : by Vincent Racaniello and David Baltimore at MIT and by Naomi Kitamura and Eckard Wimmer at Stony Brook University . Poliovirus is one of the most well-characterized viruses , and has become a useful model system for understanding the biology of RNA viruses .",
  "/wiki/Poliomyelitis": "Polio , short for poliomyelitis , or infantile paralysis , is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus . In about 0.5 percent of cases , there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move . This can occur over a few hours to a few days . The weakness most often involves the legs , but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head , neck and diaphragm . Many people fully recover . In those with muscle weakness , about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die . Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat , and up to 5 percent have headache , neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs . These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks . In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms . Years after recovery , post-polio syndrome may occur , with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection . Poliovirus is usually spread from person to person through infected fecal matter entering the mouth . It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva .",
  "/wiki/Polio_vaccine": "Polio vaccines are vaccines used to prevent poliomyelitis ( polio ) . Two types are used : an inactivated poliovirus given by injection ( IPV ) and a weakened poliovirus given by mouth ( OPV ) . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio . The two vaccines have eliminated polio from most of the world , and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 33 in 2018 . The inactivated polio vaccines are very safe . Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection . Oral polio vaccines cause about three cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis per million doses given . This compares with 5,000 cases per million who are paralysed following a polio infection . Both are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV/AIDS but are otherwise well . The first successful demonstration of a polio vaccine was by Hilary Koprowski in 1950 , with a live attenuated virus which people drank . This vaccine , however , was not approved in the United States . An inactivated polio vaccine , developed a few years later by Jonas Salk , came into use in 1955 .",
  "/wiki/Rabies_virus": "Rabies lyssavirus , formerly Rabies virus , is a neurotropic virus that causes rabies in humans and animals . Rabies transmission can occur through the saliva of animals and less commonly through contact with human saliva . Rabies lyssavirus , like many rhabdoviruses , has an extremely wide host range . In the wild it has been found infecting many mammalian species , while in the laboratory it has been found that birds can be infected , as well as cell cultures from mammals , birds , reptiles and insects . Rabies lyssavirus has a cylindrical morphology and is the type species of the Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family . These viruses are enveloped and have a single stranded RNA genome with negative-sense . The genetic information is packaged as a ribonucleoprotein complex in which RNA is tightly bound by the viral nucleoprotein . The RNA genome of the virus encodes five genes whose order is highly conserved . These genes code for nucleoprotein ( N ) , phosphoprotein ( P ) , matrix protein ( M ) , glycoprotein ( G ) and the viral RNA polymerase ( L ) . The complete genome sequences range from 11,615 to 11,966 nt in length . All transcription and replication events take place in the cytoplasm inside a specialized virus factory , the Negri body ( named after Adelchi Negri ) . These are 2-10 \u00b5m in diameter and are typical for a rabies infection and thus have been used as definite histological proof of such infection .",
  "/wiki/Rhabdoviridae": "The Rhabdoviridae are a family of viruses in the order Mononegavirales . Vertebrates ( including mammals and humans ) , invertebrates , and plants serve as natural hosts . Currently , 18 genera are recognised . Diseases associated with viruses of this family include rabies encephalitis caused by rabies virus , and vesicular diseases and encephalitis flu-like symptoms in humans caused by vesiculoviruses . The name is derived from the Greek rhabdos , meaning rod , referring to the shape of the viral particles .",
  "/wiki/Rabies": "Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals . Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure . These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms : violent movements , uncontrolled excitement , fear of water , an inability to move parts of the body , confusion , and loss of consciousness . Once symptoms appear , the result is nearly always death . The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months , but can vary from less than one week to more than one year . The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system . Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses , including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus . It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animal . Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes , mouth , or nose . Globally , dogs are the most common animal involved . In countries where dogs commonly have the disease , more than 99% of rabies cases are the direct result of dog bites . In the Americas , bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans , and less than 5% of cases are from dogs .",
  "/wiki/Rabies_vaccine": "Rabies vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent rabies . There are a number of vaccines available that are both safe and effective . They can be used to prevent rabies before and for a period of time after exposure to the virus such as by a dog or bat bite . The immunity that develops is long lasting after a full course . Doses are usually given by injection into the skin or muscle . After exposure vaccination is typically used along with rabies immunoglobulin . It is recommended that those who are at high risk of exposure be vaccinated before potential exposure . Vaccines are effective in humans and other animals . Vaccinating dogs is very effective in preventing the spread of rabies to humans . Rabies vaccines may be safely used in all age groups . About 35 to 45 percent of people develop a brief period of redness and pain at the injection site . About 5 to 15 percent of people may have fever , headaches , or nausea .",
  "/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus": "Human orthopneumovirus ( also known as human respiratory syncytial virus , or HRSV ) is a syncytial virus that causes respiratory tract infections . It is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections and hospital visits during infancy and childhood . A prophylactic medication , palivizumab , can be employed to prevent HRSV in preterm ( under 35 weeks gestation ) infants , infants with certain congenital heart defects ( CHD ) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , and infants with congenital malformations of the airway . Treatment is limited to supportive care , including oxygen therapy and more advanced breathing support with CPAP or nasal high flow oxygen , as required . In temperate climates there is an annual epidemic during the winter months . In tropical climates , infection is most common during the rainy season . In the United States , 60% of infants are infected during their first HRSV season , and nearly all children will have been infected with the virus by 2-3 years of age . Of those infected with RSV , 2-3% will develop bronchiolitis , necessitating hospitalization . Natural infection with HRSV induces protective immunity which wanes over time - possibly more so than other respiratory viral infections - and thus people can be infected multiple times . Sometimes an infant can become symptomatically infected more than once , even within a single HRSV season . Severe HRSV infections have increasingly been found among elderly patients . Young adults can be re-infected every five to seven years , with symptoms looking like a sinus infection or a cold ( infections can also be asymptomatic ) .",
  "/wiki/Palivizumab": "Palivizumab ( brand name Synagis which is manufactured by MedImmune ) is a monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology . It is used in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) infections . It is recommended for infants that are high-risk because of prematurity or other medical problems such as congenital heart disease . Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody ( IgG ) directed against an epitope in the A antigenic site of the F protein of RSV . In two phase III clinical trials in the pediatric population , palivizumab reduced the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 55% and 45% . Palivizumab is dosed once a month via intramuscular ( IM ) injection , to be administered throughout the duration of the RSV season . Palivizumab targets the fusion protein of RSV , inhibiting its entry into the cell and thereby preventing infection . Palivizumab was approved for medical use in 1998 .",

If infection occurs 0-28 days before conception , the infant has a 43% risk of being affected . If the infection occurs 0-12 weeks after conception , the risk increases to 81% . If the infection occurs 13-26 weeks after conception , the risk is 54% of the infant being affected by the disease . Infants are not generally affected if rubella is contracted during the third trimester , or 26-40 weeks after conception . Problems rarely occur when rubella is contracted by the mother after 20 weeks of gestation and continues to disseminate the virus after birth . It was discovered in 1941 by Australian Norman McAlister Gregg .",

This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are infected . A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days . It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body . The rash is sometimes itchy and is not as bright as that of measles . Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks . A fever , sore throat , and fatigue may also occur . In adults joint pain is common . Complications may include bleeding problems , testicular swelling , and inflammation of nerves . Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome ( CRS ) or miscarriage . Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts , ears such as deafness , heart , and brain . Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy ."
