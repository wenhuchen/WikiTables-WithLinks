Within a few years , Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line . Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success . Over the next few years , Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces , such as the original Macintosh in 1984 , and Apple 's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim . However , the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems , as did power struggles between executives . In 1985 , Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee , while Jobs and others resigned to found NeXT .",

Because of its small size and many languages , it is included as the default speech synthesizer in the NVDA open source screen reader for Windows , as well as Android , Ubuntu and other Linux distributions . Its predecessor eSpeak was recommended by Microsoft in 2016 and was used by Google Translate for 27 languages in 2010 ; 17 of these were subsequently replaced by commercial voices . The quality of the language voices varies greatly . In eSpeakNG 's predecessor eSpeak , the initial version of each language was based on information found on Wikipedia .

  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

  "/wiki/MIT_license": "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the late 1980s . As a permissive license , it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has , therefore , reasonable license compatibility . It is compatible because it can be re-licensed under other licenses . The MIT license is compatible with many copyleft licenses , such as the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) ; MIT licensed software can be re-licensed as GPL software , and integrated with other GPL software , but not the other way around . The MIT license also permits reuse within proprietary software , provided that either all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice , or the software is re-licensed to remove this requirement . MIT-licensed software can also be re-licensed as proprietary software , which distinguishes it from copyleft software licenses . As of 2015 [ update ] , MIT was the most popular software license on GitHub , ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software ( FOSS ) licenses . Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System , Ruby on Rails , and Node.js .",

The original version has since been revised , and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses . BSD is both a license and a class of license ( generally referred to as BSD-like ) . The modified BSD license ( in wide use today ) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix . The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format , or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format . The BSD license ( unlike some other licenses ) does not require that source code be distributed at all .",

Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
