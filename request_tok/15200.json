  "/wiki/Holy_Union_Temple": "The Jewish Museum in Bucharest , Romania is located in the former Templul Unirea Sf\u00e2nt\u0103 ( United Holy Temple ) synagogue , which survived the World War II . The name has several variants , including Museum of the History of the Romanian Jewish Community . In Romanian it is variously called Muzeul de Istorie al Comunitatilor Evreie\u0219ti din Rom\u00e2nia , Muzeul de Istorie a Comunita\u021bii Evreie\u0219ti Bucure\u0219ti etc . The museum gives broad coverage of the history of the Jews in Romania . Displays include an enormous collection of books written , published , illustrated , or translated by Romanian Jews ; a serious archive of the history of Romanian Jewry ; a collection of paintings of and by Romanian Jews that , while relatively small , consists of works of a calibre worthy of a major art museum ( many of the same artists ' works hang in the National Museum of Art ) ; memorabilia from Jewish theaters including the State Jewish Theater ; a medium-sized display devoted to Zionism ; a small but pointed display of anti-Semitic posters and tracts ; two rooms off to a side , one dealing with the Holocaust era from a historical point of view , the other a Holocaust memorial ; discussion of both favorable and unfavorable treatment of the Jews by various of Romania 's historic rulers ; in short , a museum devoted to looking seriously at the history of a particular ethnic group within a society . In contrast to its Hungarian equivalent in Budapest , this is not a museum that sees the exodus of the majority of the country 's surviving Jews to Israel as a culmination : this museum is focused more on what that means for those who have stayed , what is the continuing contribution of Jews to Romanian culture , what has been , what is , and what will be the role of Jews in Romania . The Museum also contains a large collection of Jewish ritual objects from Romania , collected by Rabbi Moses Rosen ( 1912-1994 ) , the late Chief Rabbi of the Romanian Jewry .",
