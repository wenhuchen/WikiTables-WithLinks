  "/wiki/Airbus_A319": "The Airbus A319 is a member of the Airbus A320 family of short- to medium-range , narrow-body , commercial passenger twin-engine jet airliners manufactured by Airbus . [ b ] The A319 carries 124 to 156 passengers and has a maximum range of 3,700 nmi ( 6,900 km ; 4,300 mi ) . Final assembly of the aircraft takes place in Hamburg , Germany and Tianjin , China . The A319 is a shortened-fuselage variant of the Airbus A320 and entered service in April 1996 with Swissair , around two years after the stretched Airbus A321 and eight years after the original A320 . The aircraft shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants , allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training . As of August 2019 , a total of 1,480 Airbus A319 aircraft have been delivered , of which 1,436 are in service . In addition , another 42 airliners are on firm order ( comprising 7 A319ceo and 35 A319neo ) . As of August 2019 , American Airlines was the largest operator of the Airbus A319 , operating 131 aircraft . In December 2010 , Airbus announced a new generation of the A320 family , the A320neo ( new engine option ) . The similarly shortened fuselage A319neo variant offers new , more efficient engines , combined with airframe improvements and the addition of winglets , named sharklets by Airbus . The aircraft promises fuel savings of up to 15% .",
  "/wiki/Airbus_A320": "The Airbus A320 family are narrow-body airliners designed and produced by Airbus . The A320 was launched in March 1984 , first flew on 22 February 1987 , and was introduced in April 1988 by Air France . The first member of the family was followed by the longer A321 ( first delivered in January 1994 ) , the shorter A319 ( April 1996 ) , and the even shorter A318 ( July 2003 ) . Final assembly takes place in Toulouse in France ; Hamburg in Germany ; Tianjin in China since 2009 ; and in Mobile , Alabama in the United States since April 2016 . The twinjet has a six-abreast cross-section and is powered by either CFM56 or IAE V2500 turbofans , except the CFM56/PW6000 powered A318 . The family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls in airliners . Variants offer maximum take-off weights from 68 to 93.5 t ( 150,000 to 206,000 lb ) , to cover a 3,100-3,750 nmi ( 5,740-6,940 km ) range . The 31.4 m ( 103 ft ) long A318 typically accommodates 107 to 132 passengers . The 124-156 seats A319 is 33.8 m ( 111 ft ) long . The A320 is 37.6 m ( 123 ft ) long and can accommodate 150 to 186 passengers . The 44.5 m ( 146 ft ) A321 offers 185 to 230 seats . The Airbus Corporate Jets are business jet versions .",
  "/wiki/Airbus_A330": "The Airbus A330 is a wide-body airliner made by Airbus . In the mid-1970s , Airbus conceived several derivatives of the A300 , its first airliner , and developed the A330 twinjet in parallel with the A340 quadjet . In June 1987 , Airbus launched both designs with their first orders . The A330-300 , the first variant , took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered service with Air Inter in January 1994 . The slightly shorter A330-200 variant followed in 1998 . In 2014 , Airbus launched the A330neo , re-engined with Trent 7000 turbofans , which entered service in November 2018 . The A330 has a similar airframe to early A340 , except for the number of engines : two instead of four , landing gear and weights . Both airliners have fly-by-wire controls , which was first introduced on the A320 , as well as a similar glass cockpit . The A330 was Airbus 's first airliner to offer a choice of three engines : the General Electric CF6 , Pratt & Whitney PW4000 , or the Rolls-Royce Trent 700 . The A330-300 has a range of 11,750 km or 6,350 nmi with 277 passengers , while the shorter A330-200 can cover 13,450 km or 7,250 nmi with 247 passengers . Later variants include the A330-200F dedicated freighter , the A330 MRTT military tanker , and the ACJ330 corporate jet . The A330 MRTT was proposed as the EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45 for the US Air Force 's KC-X competition , but lost to the Boeing KC-46 in appeal after an initial win .",
  "/wiki/Boeing_737_Classic": "The Boeing 737 Classic are narrow-body airliners produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes , the second generation of the original Boeing 737-100/-200 . Development began in 1979 and the first variant , the 737-300 , first flew in February 1984 and entered service in December of that year . The stretched 737-400 first flew in February 1988 and entered service later that year The shortest 737-500 first flew in June 1989 and entered service in 1990 . It is re-engined with higher bypass ratio CFM56 turbofans for a better fuel economy and has upgraded avionics . With a 133,500-150,000 lb ( 60.6-68.0 t ) MTOW , it has a range of 2,060 to 2,375 nmi ( 3,815 to 4,398 km ) . At 102 ft ( 31 m ) , the -500 is similar in length to the original 737-200 and can fly 110 to 132 passengers . The 110 ft ( 33.4 m ) long -300 can seat 126 to 149 passengers while the 120 ft ( 36.4 m ) long -400 accommodates 147 to 168 seats . It competed with the MD-80 family , then with the Airbus A320 which prompted Boeing to update its offer with the 737 Next Generation , thus designating the -300/400/500 variants the 737 classic . In total , 1,988 aircraft were delivered until the year 2000 : 1,113 -300s , 486 -400s and 389 -500s .",
  "/wiki/Boeing_757": "The Boeing 757 is a mid-sized , narrow-body short to medium range , twin-engine airliner that was designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes . It is the manufacturer 's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004 . The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit , turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes , a conventional tail , and , for reduced aerodynamic drag , a supercritical wing design . Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes , the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of 3,150 to 4,100 nautical miles ( 5,830 to 7,590 km ) , depending on variant . The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide-body twinjet , the 767 , and , owing to shared features , pilots can obtain a common type rating that allows them to operate both aircraft . The 757 was produced in two fuselage lengths . The original 757-200 entered service in 1983 ; the 757-200PF , a package freighter ( PF ) variant , and the 757-200M , a passenger-freighter combi model , debuted in the late 1980s . The stretched 757-300 , the longest narrow-body twinjet ever produced , began service in 1999 . Passenger 757-200s have been modified to special freighter ( SF ) specification for cargo use , while military derivatives include the C-32 transport , VIP carriers , and other multi-purpose aircraft . Private and government operators have also customized the 757 for research and transport roles . All 757s are powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 or Pratt & Whitney PW2000 series turbofans . Eastern Air Lines and British Airways placed the 757 in commercial service in 1983 .",

Their design was derived from the smaller CRJ100 and 200 airliners . During the 1990s , Bombardier initiated development on the CRJ-X , a programme to produce enlarged derivatives of its popular CRJ100/200 family . Officially launched in 1997 , the CRJ700 's maiden flight took place on 27 May 1999 ; it was soon followed by the stretched CRJ900 variant . Several additional variants of the type were subsequently introduced , including the CRJ550 and the elongated CRJ1000 . While production of the smaller CRJ100/200 range was discontinued during 2006 , the larger CRJ Series models have continued to be produced into the 2010s . Competitors have included the Fokker 70/Fokker 100 , the BAe 146 family , and the Embraer E-Jet family . In Bombardier 's lineup , the CRJ Series was formerly marketed alongside a family of larger jets , the C Series ( now majority-owned by Airbus and marketed as the Airbus A220 ) and a twin-turboprop , the Q Series ( now owned by De Havilland Canada and marketed as the Dash 8 ) . During the late 2010s , Bombardier sought to sell off several of its aircraft programmes .
