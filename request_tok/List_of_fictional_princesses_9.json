  "/wiki/Master_System": "The Sega Master System ( SMS ) [ c ] is a third-generation 8-bit home video game console manufactured by Sega . It was originally a remodeled export version of the Sega Mark III , the third iteration of the SG-1000 series of consoles , which was released in Japan in 1985 and featured enhanced graphical capabilities over its predecessors . The Master System launched in North America in 1986 , followed by Europe in 1987 , and Brazil in 1989 . A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987 , which features a few enhancements over the export models ( and by proxy the original Mark III ) : a built-in FM audio chip , a rapid-fire switch , and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses . A cost-reduced model known as the Master System II was released in 1990 in North America and Europe . The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards . Accessories for the consoles include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with a range of specially designed games . The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot , turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system and is incompatible with the 3D glasses . The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES , due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity . Though the Master System had newer , improved hardware , it failed to overturn Nintendo 's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America . However , it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil .",

While exact dates are debated , the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s . Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s , the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost .

It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom , France , Spain , and the German-speaking parts of Europe . The series spawned a total of six distinct models : The CPC464 , CPC664 , and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market . The later 464plus and 6128plus , intended to prolong the system 's lifecycle with hardware updates , were considerably less successful , as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000 . The CPC models ' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU , complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM . Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device , either a compact cassette deck or 3 inch floppy disk drive . The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour , green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit 's power supply . Additionally , a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives , printers , and memory extensions , was available . The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software . The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor , its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users , which was reflected by a wide selection of application software . During its lifetime , the CPC series sold approximately three million units .",
  "/wiki/Commodore_64": "The Commodore 64 , also known as the C64 or the CBM 64 , is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International ( first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , January 7-10 , 1982 ) . It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",

The Spectrum was released as eight different models , ranging from the entry level with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128 KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987 ; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide ( not counting clones ) . The Spectrum was among the first mainstream-audience home computers in the UK , similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the US . The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine , the effects of which are still seen . Some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry . Licensing deals and clones followed , and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for services to British industry . The Commodore 64 , Dragon 32 , Oric-1 , Oric Atmos , BBC Micro and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s .

It was based on a Z80 CPU . Despite the fact that the Computer Division of Sharp Corporation had released the MZ series , suddenly the Television Division released a new computer series called the X1 . At the time the original X1 was released , all other home computers generally had a BASIC language in ROM . However the X1 did not have a BASIC ROM , and it had to load the Hu-BASIC interpreter from a cassette tape . On the plus side however , this concept meant that a free RAM area was available that was as big as possible when not using BASIC . This policy was originally copied from the Sharp MZ series , and they were called clean computers in Japan . The cabinet shape of X1 was also much more stylish than others at that time and a range of cabinet colors ( including Red ) was selectable . The RGB display monitor for the X1 had a television tuner , and a computer screen could be super-imposed on TV . All the TV functions could be controlled from a computer program .

  "/wiki/Sega_Saturn": "The Sega Saturn [ a ] [ b ] is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console developed by Sega and released on November 22 , 1994 in Japan , May 11 , 1995 in North America , and July 8 , 1995 in Europe . The successor to the successful Sega Genesis , the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors . Its games are in CD-ROM format , and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games . Development of the Saturn began in 1992 , the same year Sega 's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted . The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi . Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",

As a seventh generation console , the PSP primarily competed with the Nintendo DS . Development of the PSP was announced during E3 2003 , and the console was unveiled at a Sony press conference on May 11 , 2004 . The system was the most powerful portable console when it was introduced , and was the first real competitor of Nintendo 's handheld consoles after many challengers , such as SNK 's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia 's N-Gage , had failed . The PSP 's advanced graphics capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device , which could connect to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles , computers running Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh software , other PSP systems , and the Internet . The PSP is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format - Universal Media Disc ( UMD ) - as its primary storage medium . The PSP was received positively by critics , and sold over 80 million units during its ten-year lifetime . Several models of the console were released , before the PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita , released in Japan in 2011 and worldwide a year later . The Vita has backward compatibility with PSP games that were released on the PlayStation Network through the PlayStation Store , which became the main method of purchasing PSP games after Sony shut down access to the store from the PSP on March 31 , 2016 .

The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable , and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices ; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles , it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS . The original model of the handheld includes a 5-inch ( 130 mm ) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen , two analog joysticks , and front and shoulder push-button input , and supports Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , and optional 3G . Internally , the Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core SGX543MP graphics processing unit . The PS Vita 2000 series , a revised version of the system , was released across 2013 and 2014 , sports all of the same features with a slightly smaller size , extended battery life , and an LCD screen replacing the OLED display . Sony also released the PlayStation TV , a short-lived , re-purposed version of the Vita that allowed for the play of PS Vita games on a television screen similar to a home video game console , though the PS TV variant was discontinued by the end of 2015 . The system 's design was created to meld the experience of big budget , dedicated video game platforms with the then up-and-coming trend of mobile gaming through smart phones and tablets . However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units .",

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) .

The game is played from a first-person perspective and allows the player to undertake a series of missions in a variety of ways , with an emphasis on player choice . Missions can be completed through stealth , combat , or a combination of both . Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals , and it is possible to complete all missions , eliminating all of Corvo 's targets , in a non-lethal manner . The story and missions are changed in response to the player 's violent actions or lack thereof . Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects . During its three years in production , several versions of Dishonored were developed . Before the creation of Dunwall - inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh - the game was set to take place in medieval Japan and seventeenth-century London .",

  "/wiki/Dragon's_Lair": "Dragon 's Lair is a video game franchise created by Rick Dyer and Don Bluth . The series is famous for its western animation-style graphics and convoluted decades-long history of being ported to many platforms and being remade into television and comic book series . The first game in the series is titled Dragon 's Lair , originally released for the arcades in 1983 by Cinematronics . It uses laserdisc technology , offering greatly superior graphics compared to other video games at the time . The game was ported to several other platforms , but as no home system technology of that era could accommodate the graphical quality of laserdisc , several abridged versions of the original game were released under different names . The first true sequel , Dragon 's Lair II : Time Warp , would only appear in 1991 . While its graphics were once again praised , the poor controls and limited interactivity kept it from reaching the popularity of the original . The two main games in the series are considered gaming classics and are constantly re-released for each new generation of consoles . In 2010 , they were bundled alongside the unrelated 1984 Bluth Group game Space Ace in the Dragon 's Lair Trilogy which was made available across numerous platforms . The series ' forays into other media include a short-lived cartoon series that aired on ABC in 1984 and a comic-book miniseries released in 2003 . Plans for a feature-length film have existed since the 1980s and have resurfaced in 2015 , when Bluth launched a crowd-funding campaign to secure funds for a Dragon 's Lair movie pitch . After an initially unsuccessful bid on Kickstarter , a second Indiegogo campaign managed to reach its target in early 2016 .",
  "/wiki/Dragon_Quest_(video_game)": "Dragon Quest , [ a ] titled Dragon Warrior when initially localized to North America , is the first role-playing video game ( RPG ) in the Dragon Quest media franchise . It was developed by Chunsoft for the Family Computer and published by Enix in Japan in 1986 as Dragon Quest and by Nintendo in 1989 in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System . Dragon Quest has been ported and remade for several video game platforms , including the MSX , PC-9801 , Super Famicom , Game Boy Color , Nintendo 3DS , PlayStation 4 , mobile phones , and Nintendo Switch as of 2019 . Players control a hero character who is charged with saving the Kingdom of Alefgard and rescuing its princess from the evil Dragonlord . Dragon Warrior 's story became the second part in a trilogy . Several more anime and manga series , which revolve around this overarching plot were created . Dragon Quest was created by Yuji Horii , who took inspiration from previous role-playing games such as Wizardry , Ultima , and his own 1983 game The Portopia Serial Murder Case . Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to a wide audience of people who were unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general . He tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement , as well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre to the Japanese console market . Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama produced the game 's artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music . The North American version features numerous changes , including battery-backed RAM save games ( rather than using a password save system ) , modified character sprites , and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog . Dragon Quest was commercially successful in Japan , with more than 2 million copies sold .",
  "/wiki/Dragon_Quest_II:_Luminaries_of_the_Legendary_Line": "Dragon Quest II : Luminaries of the Legendary Line , [ a ] titled Dragon Warrior II when initially localized to North America , is a role-playing video game developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix in 1987 for the Nintendo Entertainment System as a part of the Dragon Quest series . Enix 's U.S. subsidiary published the American version , Dragon Warrior II , for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 . Dragon Quest II is set one hundred years after the events of the first game . The game 's story centers on the prince of Midenhall , who is ordered to stop an evil wizard named Hargon after Hargon destroys Moonbrooke Castle . On his adventure , he is accompanied by his two cousins , the prince of Cannock and the princess of Moonbrooke . Dragon Quest II expands on the first game by having a larger party , more areas to explore , multiple heroes and enemies in a battle , and a sailing ship . The game 's successor , Dragon Quest III , follows the ancestor of the main characters , the legendary hero Erdrick ; and the three games are collectively called Erdrick Saga Trilogy . Planning began a month before the original Dragon Quest was released . One major goal was the development of a more exciting combat system , which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in Wizardry . The artwork that was used as the basis for the characters and monsters was painted by Akira Toriyama and then translated into pixel art . The game was hit with delays due to game balance , which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game . This , combined with a staff that included students not familiar with the coding and debugging process , pushed back the release by a month ."
