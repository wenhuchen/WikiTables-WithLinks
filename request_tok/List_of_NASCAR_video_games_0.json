  "/wiki/Commodore_64": "The Commodore 64 , also known as the C64 or the CBM 64 , is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International ( first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , January 7-10 , 1982 ) . It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",
  "/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family": "The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari , Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992 . All of the machines in the family are technically similar and differ primarily in packaging . They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz , [ a ] and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips . This architecture enabled graphics and sound capabilities more advanced than most contemporary machines , and gaming on the platform was a major draw . The first-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform 's killer app . The systems launched with a series of plug and play peripherals that used the Atari SIO serial bus system , an early analog of USB . [ b ] To meet stringent FCC requirements , much of the circuitry of the original machines is enclosed in a cast aluminum block , which made them physically robust but expensive to produce . The 400 and 800 were replaced by the XL series in 1983 , then-after the company was sold and reestablished as Atari Corporation-the XE models in 1985 . The XL and XE are lighter in construction and less expensive to build , while also having Atari BASIC built-in and reducing the number of joystick ports from 4 to 2 . The 130XE , released in 1985 , increased the memory to 128K of bank-switched RAM . The Atari 8-bit computer line sold two million units during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985 . They were not only sold through dedicated computer retailers , but department stores such as Sears , using an in-store demo to attract customers .",

The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",

Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources . It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI . It is a flexible operating system , and consumes negligible installation space .",

The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface , built-in screen , and mouse . Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993 . Early Macintosh models were expensive , hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper Commodore 64 for consumers , as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses . Although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac . Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing , making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade . In the early 1990s , Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time . However , the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel 's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks , gradually took market share from Apple , and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer . Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s , the falling prices of commodity PC components , poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa , and the release of Windows 95 contributed to some decline of the Macintosh user base . Upon his return , Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 ( including models made for specific regions ) down to four in mid-1999 : the Power Macintosh G3 , iMac , 14.1 PowerBook G3 , and 12 iBook . All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance , competitive prices and aesthetic designs , and helped return Apple to profitability .

The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi . Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",
  "/wiki/EA_Sports": "EA Sports is a division of Electronic Arts that develops and publishes sports video games . Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts , in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling themselves the EA Sports Network ( EASN ) with pictures or endorsements with real commentators such as John Madden , it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own , releasing game series such as FIFA , NHL , NBA Live and Madden NFL . Most games under this brand are developed by EA Vancouver , the studio of Electronic Arts in Burnaby , British Columbia as well as EA Tiburon in Maitland , Florida . The main rival to EA Sports is 2K Sports . Notably , both companies compete over the realm of NBA games . Konami is its rival in association football games . Unlike some other sports game companies , EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform , which means that all games are released for the bestselling active platforms , sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them . For example , FIFA 98 , Madden NFL 98 , NBA Live 98 , and NHL 98 were released for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES throughout 1997 ; Madden NFL 2005 and FIFA 2005 had PlayStation releases in 2004 ( FIFA 2005 and Madden NFL 2005 were also the last two PlayStation titles to be released ) ; and NCAA Football 08 had an Xbox release in 2007 . Madden NFL 08 also had Xbox and Nintendo GameCube releases in 2007 , and was the final title released for the GameCube , with Madden NFL 09 following as the final Xbox title . Additionally , NASCAR Thunder 2003 and NASCAR Thunder 2004 were released not only for the PlayStation 2 , but for the original PlayStation as well . EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English Football League Two team Swindon Town F.C . from the 2009-10 season onward and the EA Sports Cup in the Republic of Ireland .",

  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries .",
