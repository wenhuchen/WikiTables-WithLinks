The arhats , or at least the senior arhats , came to be widely regarded by Theravada buddhists as moving beyond the state of personal freedom to join the Bodhisattva enterprise in their own way . Mahayana Buddhism regarded a group of Eighteen Arhats ( with names and personalities ) as awaiting the return of the Buddha as Maitreya , while other groupings of 6 , 8 , 16 , 100 , and 500 also appear in tradition and Buddhist art , especially in East Asia called luohan or lohan .

  "/wiki/Jainism": "Jainism ( /\u02c8d\u0292e\u026an\u026az\u0259m/ ) , traditionally known as Jain Dharma , is an ancient Indian religion . Followers of Jainism are called Jains , a word derived from the Sanskrit word jina ( victor ) referring to the path of victory in crossing over life 's stream of rebirths by destroying karma through an ethical and spiritual life . Jainism is a transtheistic religion , and Jains trace their spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as tirthankaras , with the first being Rishabhanatha , who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago , the twenty-third Tirthankara Parshvanatha in 900 BCE , and the twenty-fourth Tirthankara the Mah\u0101v\u012bra around 500 BCE . Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology . Their religious texts are called Agamas . The main religious premises of Jainism are ahi\u1e43s\u0101 ( non-violence ) , anek\u0101ntav\u0101da ( many-sidedness ) , aparigraha ( non-attachment ) and asceticism . Devout Jains take five main vows : ahi\u1e43s\u0101 ( non-violence ) , satya ( truth ) , asteya ( not stealing ) , brahmacharya ( celibacy or chastity or sexual continence ) , and aparigraha ( non-possessiveness ) . These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways , such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles . Parasparopagraho J\u012bv\u0101n\u0101m ( the function of souls is to help one another ) is the motto of Jainism . \u1e46am\u014dk\u0101ra mantra is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism . Jainism has two major ancient sub-traditions , Digambaras and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras ; Several smaller sub-traditions emerged in the 2nd millennium CE . The Digambaras and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras have different views on ascetic practices , gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical .",

The version canonical to Theravada Buddhism is generally referred to in English as the Pali Canon . Mahayana Buddhism also holds the Tripi\u1e6daka to be authoritative but , unlike Theravadins , it also includes in its canon various derivative literature and commentaries that were composed much later . The Tripi\u1e6daka was composed between about 550 BCE and about the start of the common era , likely written down for the first time in the 1st century BCE . The Dipavamsa states that during the reign of Valagamba of Anuradhapura ( 29-17 BCE ) the monks who had previously remembered the Tripi\u1e6daka and its commentary orally now wrote them down in books , because of the threat posed by famine and war . The Mahavamsa also refers briefly to the writing down of the canon and the commentaries at this time . Each Buddhist sub-tradition had its own Tripi\u1e6daka for its monasteries , written by its sangha , each set consisting of 32 books , in three parts or baskets of teachings : Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka ( Basket of Discipline ) , S\u016btra Pi\u1e6daka ( Basket of Discourse ) , and Abhidharma Pi\u1e6daka ( Basket of Special [ or Further ] Doctrine ) .
