  "/wiki/Red_Riding": "Red Riding ( 2009 ) is a three-part television adaptation of English author David Peace 's Red Riding Quartet ( 1999-2002 ) . The quartet comprises the novels Nineteen Seventy-Four ( 1999 ) , Nineteen Seventy-Seven ( 2000 ) , Nineteen Eighty ( 2001 ) and Nineteen Eighty-Three ( 2002 ) and the first , third , and fourth of these books became three feature-length television episodes : Red Riding 1974 , Red Riding 1980 , and Red Riding 1983 . They aired in the UK on Channel 4 beginning on 5 March 2009 and were produced by Revolution Films . The three films were released theatrically in the US in February 2010 . Set against a backdrop of serial murders from 1974 to 1983 , including the Yorkshire Ripper killings , the books and films follow several recurring fictional characters through a bleak and violent world of multi-layered police corruption and organised crime . Although there are allusions to real-life crimes , the plot is fictional rather than a documentary or factual account of events . Both the books and films mix elements of fact , fiction , and conspiracy theory - a confection dubbed Yorkshire Noir by some critics - and are notable for a chronologically fractured narrative and for defying neat or trite endings and resolutions . The name of the series is a reference to the murders and to their location , the historic county of Yorkshire being traditionally divided into three areas known as ridings .",
  "/wiki/Macbeth": "Macbeth ( /m\u0259k\u02c8b\u025b\u03b8/ ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth ) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare ; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606 . [ a ] It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake . Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I , who was patron of Shakespeare 's acting company , Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright 's relationship with his sovereign . It was first published in the Folio of 1623 , possibly from a prompt book , and is Shakespeare 's shortest tragedy . A brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland . Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife , Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself . He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia . Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion , he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler . The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death . Shakespeare 's source for the story is the account of Macbeth , King of Scotland , Macduff , and Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of England , Scotland , and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries , although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth . The events of the tragedy are usually associated with the execution of Henry Garnet for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 . In the backstage world of theatre , some believe that the play is cursed , and will not mention its title aloud , referring to it instead as The Scottish Play .",
