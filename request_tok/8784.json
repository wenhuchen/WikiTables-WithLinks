An officer so promoted was referred to as being brevetted ( for example , he was brevetted Major General ) . The promotion would be noted in the officer 's title ( for example , Bvt . Maj. Gen. Joshua L. Chamberlain or Bvt . Col. Arthur MacArthur ) . It is not to be confused with a brevet in Francophone European military circles , where it is an award , nor should it be confused with temporary commissions .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Opequon": "The Third Battle of Winchester ( or Battle of Opequon ) , was fought just outside Winchester , Virginia , on September 19 , 1864 , during the Valley Campaigns of 1864 in the American Civil War . After the victory at Berryville as the month began , Union Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan sought information about the troop strength of Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal A . Early . Earlier in the year , his subordinate Union Gen. George Crook had met Rebecca Wright , a Quaker schoolteacher and Union sympathizer in Winchester , a commercial center and transportation hub at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley with many Confederate sympathizers and which changed hands 75 times during the war . Slave Thomas Laws of Millwood ( between Berryville and Winchester ) had a Confederate permit to sell produce in Winchester three days per week , and agreed to act as a Union spy . On September 16 , Laws took Sheridan 's letter ( hidden in his mouth ) to Wright , who consulted her mother and then replied ( in a note which Laws also hid in his mouth ) that a Confederate officer recovering from his wounds had recently bragged about Confederate artillery and infantry battalions under General Joseph B. Kershaw and Lt. Col. Wilfred E. Cutshaw having left Winchester to raid the B & O Railroad at Martinsburg , in the new state of West Virginia . Accordingly , Sheridan advanced toward Winchester along the Berryville Pike with the VI Corps and XIX Corps , crossing Opequon Creek . The Union advance was delayed long enough for Early to concentrate his forces to meet the main assault , which continued for several hours . Casualties were very heavy . The Confederate line was gradually driven back toward the town . Mid-afternoon , the Army of West Virginia and the cavalry turned the Confederate left flank . Early ordered a general retreat .",
  "/wiki/James_A._Garfield": "James Abram Garfield ( November 19 , 1831 - September 19 , 1881 ) was the 20th president of the United States , serving from March 4 , 1881 until his death by assassination six and a half months later . He is the only sitting member of the United States House of Representatives to be elected to the presidency . Garfield entered politics as a Republican in 1857 . He served as a member of the Ohio State Senate from 1859 to 1861 . Garfield opposed Confederate secession , served as a major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War , and fought in the battles of Middle Creek , Shiloh , and Chickamauga . He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio 's 19th District . Throughout Garfield 's extended congressional service after the Civil War , he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator . Garfield initially agreed with Radical Republican views regarding Reconstruction , but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for freedmen . At the 1880 Republican National Convention , delegates chose Garfield - who had not sought the White House - as a compromise presidential candidate on the 36th ballot . In the 1880 presidential election , Garfield conducted a low-key front porch campaign and narrowly defeated Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock . Garfield 's accomplishments as president included a resurgence of presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments , purging corruption in the Post Office , and appointing a U.S. Supreme Court justice . He enhanced the powers of the presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York , starting a fracas that ended with Robertson 's confirmation and Conkling 's resignation from the Senate .",

Johnston , was forming a defensive line along the south side of Pumpkinvine Creek .

The remaining supply lines were cut and the Confederate defenders were reduced by over 10,000 men killed , wounded , taken prisoner or in flight . The thinly held Confederate lines at Petersburg had been stretched to the breaking point by earlier Union movements that extended those lines beyond the ability of the Confederates to man them adequately and by desertions and casualties from recent battles . As the much larger Union forces assaulted the lines , desperate Confederate defenders held off the Union breakthrough long enough for Confederate government officials and most of the remaining Confederate army , including local defense forces and some Confederate Navy personnel , to flee Petersburg and the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia during the night of April 2-3 . Confederate corps commander Lieutenant General A.P . Hill was killed during the fighting .
