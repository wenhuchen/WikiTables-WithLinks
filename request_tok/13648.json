It was originally the only attraction on the property ; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s .

He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit ; however , he soon realized that the proposed site was too small . After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project , Disney bought a 160-acre ( 65 ha ) site near Anaheim in 1953 . Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17 , 1955 . Since its opening , Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations , including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966 , Bear Country ( now Critter Country ) in 1972 , Mickey 's Toontown in 1993 , and Star Wars : Galaxy 's Edge in 2019 . Opened in 2001 , Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland 's original parking lot .
