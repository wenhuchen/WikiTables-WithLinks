With about 10 million inhabitants , Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union . The official language is Hungarian , which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world , and among the few non-Indo-European languages to be widely spoken in Europe . Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory , 58% of its population , and 32% of ethnic Hungarians .",

  "/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine": "Mandatory Palestine [ a ] P\u0101l\u0113\u015bt\u012bn\u0101 ( EY ) , where EY indicates Eretz Yisrael Land of Israel ) was a geopolitical entity established between 1920 and 1948 in the region of Palestine under the terms of the Mandate for Palestine . During the First World War ( 1914-18 ) , an Arab uprising and the British Empire 's Egyptian Expeditionary Force under General Edmund Allenby drove the Turks out of the Levant during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign . The United Kingdom had agreed in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence that it would honour Arab independence if they revolted against the Ottomans , but the two sides had different interpretations of this agreement , and in the end , the UK and France divided up the area under the Sykes-Picot Agreement - an act of betrayal in the eyes of the Arabs . Further complicating the issue was the Balfour Declaration of 1917 , promising British support for a Jewish national home in Palestine . At the war 's end the British and French set up a joint Occupied Enemy Territory Administration in what had been Ottoman Syria . The British achieved legitimacy for their continued control by obtaining a mandate from the League of Nations in June 1922 . The formal objective of the League of Nations mandate system was to administer parts of the defunct Ottoman Empire , which had been in control of the Middle East since the 16th century , until such time as they are able to stand alone . During the British Mandate period the area experienced the ascent of two major nationalist movements , one among the Jews and the other among the Palestinian Arabs . The competing national interests of the two populations against each other and against the governing British authorities matured into the Arab Revolt of 1936-1939 and the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine , before culminating in the 1947-1949 Palestine war . This led to the establishment of the 1949 cease-fire agreement , with partition of the former Mandatory Palestine between the newborn state of Israel with a Jewish majority , the Arab West Bank annexed by the Jordanian Kingdom and the Arab All-Palestine Protectorate in the Gaza Strip under Egypt .",

Its avowed aim was to evict the British authorities from Palestine by resort to force , allowing unrestricted immigration of Jews and the formation of a Jewish state , a new totalitarian Hebrew republic . It was initially called the National Military Organization in Israel , upon being founded in August 1940 , but was renamed Lehi one month later . The group referred to its members as terrorists and admitted to having used terrorist attacks . Lehi split from the Irgun militant group in 1940 in order to continue fighting the British during World War II . Lehi initially sought an alliance with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany , offering to fight alongside them against the British in return for the transfer of all Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe to Palestine . Believing that Nazi Germany was a lesser enemy of the Jews than Britain , Lehi twice attempted to form an alliance with the Nazis . During World War II , it declared that it would establish a Jewish state based upon nationalist and totalitarian principles . After Stern 's death in 1942 , the new leadership of Lehi began to move it towards support for Joseph Stalin 's Soviet Union . In 1944 , Lehi officially declared its support for National Bolshevism . It said that its National Bolshevism involved an amalgamation of left-wing and right-wing political elements - Stern said Lehi incorporated elements of both the left and the right - however this change was unpopular and Lehi began to lose support as a result . Lehi and the Irgun were jointly responsible for the massacre in Deir Yassin .",

The Irgun is also referred to as Etzel ( \u05d0\u05e6\u05dc ) , an acronym of the Hebrew initials , or by the abbreviation IZL . The Irgun policy was based on what was then called Revisionist Zionism founded by Ze'ev Jabotinsky . According to Howard Sachar , The policy of the new organization was based squarely on Jabotinsky 's teachings : every Jew had the right to enter Palestine ; only active retaliation would deter the Arabs ; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state . Two of the operations for which the Irgun is best known are the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on 22 July 1946 and the Deir Yassin massacre , carried out together with Lehi on 9 April 1948 . The Irgun has been viewed as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts . Specifically the organization committed acts of terrorism and assassination against the British , whom it regarded as illegal occupiers , and it was also violently anti-Arab according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica . In particular the Irgun was described as a terrorist organization by the United Nations , British , and United States governments ; in media such as The New York Times newspaper ; as well as by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry , the 1946 Zionist Congress and the Jewish Agency .",

On the day of the derailment , all four of the police officers at Mitaka Station abandoned their posts ; this was never explained . Two of the alleged conspirators were indicted for perjury . Takeuchi 's lawyer refused to allow a co-worker to present evidence affirming that he and Takeuchi were in a public bath together when the train left the station ( an apparently airtight proof that at least one other person was involved ) , claiming it was irrelevant to the case . In a court ruling in 1955 , the judge found there was no evidence of a conspiracy , but rather that Takeuchi had planned and executed the entire incident himself . Takeuchi was sentenced to death ; the other defendants were declared innocent of all charges . All appeals of the verdict were rejected . All the acquitted defendants were members of the Japan Communist Party , but Takeuchi was not . Takeuchi died in jail in 1967 of a brain tumour .

It traverses a spur of the larger Annamite Range that juts into the East Sea of Viet Nam , on the border of \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng and Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean-Hu\u1ebf Province , near B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 National Park . Its name refers to the mists that rise from the sea , reducing visibility . Historically , the pass was a physical division between the kingdoms of Champa and \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t . The twisting road on the pass has long been a challenge for drivers traveling between the cities of Hu\u1ebf and \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng . Since the completion of H\u1ea3i V\u00e2n Tunnel , traffic flow and safety have improved . The pass has been the scene of at least two of Vietnam 's most serious rail accidents , and at least one air crash .",

A grouping of the three Vietnamese regions of Tonkin ( north ) , Annam ( centre ) , and Cochinchina ( south ) with Cambodia was formed in 1887 . Laos came under French control in 1893 and became part of Indochina in 1899 . Finally , the leased Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan was added in 1898 . The capital was moved from Saigon ( in Cochinchina ) to Hanoi ( Tonkin ) in 1902 and again to Da Lat ( Annam ) in 1939 . In 1945 it was moved back to Hanoi . After the Fall of France during World War II , the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945 , when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime . After the Japanese surrender , the Viet Minh , a communist organization led by H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh , declared Vietnamese independence , but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina . An all-out independence war , known as the First Indochina War , broke out in late 1946 between French and Viet Minh forces . In order to create a political alternative to the Viet Minh , the State of Vietnam , led by former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i , was proclaimed in 1949 . On 22 October and 9 November 1953 , the Kingdom of Laos and Kingdom of Cambodia proclaimed their respective independence . Following the Geneva Accord of 1954 , the French evacuated Vietnam and French Indochina came to an end .",
  "/wiki/1953_Col_des_Nuages_derailment": "The Col des Nuages derailment was a train derailment that occurred in eastern French Indochina , in modern-day Vietnam , on 24 June 1953 , during the First Indochina War . Railway officials announced the day after that about 100 or more were killed when a passenger train plunged 50 feet through a sabotaged viaduct . Two locomotives and 18 cars crashed down in a ravine at the Col des Nuages ( Pass of the Clouds , known now as the Hai Van Pass ) , a mountain pass on the route between the ancient Vietnamese capital of Hu\u1ebf and the port of Tourane ( \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng ) . The pass had frequently been the scene of attacks by the communist-directed Viet Minh rebels . Officials said that a strong explosive charge detonated just as the train arrived at the viaduct , tumbling a 25-foot span into the ravine .",
  "/wiki/Viaduct": "A viaduct is a bridge composed of several small spans for crossing a valley , dry or wetland , or forming an overpass or flyover . The term is conventional for a rail flyover as opposed to a flying junction or a rail bridge which crosses one feature . The term viaduct is derived from the Latin via for road and ducere , to lead . The ancient Romans did not use the term ; it is a nineteenth-century derivation from an analogy with aqueduct . Like the Roman aqueducts , many early viaducts comprised a series of arches of roughly equal length .",
