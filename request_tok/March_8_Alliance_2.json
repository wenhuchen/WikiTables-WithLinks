It was co-founded by Musa al-Sadr and Hussein el Husseini as the Movement of the Dispossessed in 1974 . The Amal movement gained attention from Shia outcry after the disappearance of Musa al-Sadr and saw a renewal in popularity after Israel 's invasion of Lebanon in 1978 .

  "/wiki/Populism": "Populism refers to a range of political stances that emphasize the idea of the people and often juxtapose this group against the elite . The term developed in the 19th century and has been applied to various politicians , parties , and movements since that time , although has rarely been chosen as a self-description . Within political science and other social sciences , several different definitions of populism have been employed , with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether . A common framework for interpreting populism is known as the ideational approach : this defines populism as an ideology which presents the people as a morally good force and contrasts them against the elite , who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving . Populists differ in how the people are defined , but it can be based along class , ethnic , or national lines . Populists typically present the elite as comprising the political , economic , cultural , and media establishment , depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests , and often the interests of other groups - such as large corporations , foreign countries , or immigrants - above the interests of the people . Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as the voice of the people . According to the ideational approach , populism is often combined with other ideologies , such as nationalism , liberalism , or socialism . Thus , populists can be found at different locations along the left-right political spectrum , and there exist both left-wing populism and right-wing populism . Other scholars of the social sciences have defined the term populism differently . According to the popular agency definition used by some historians of United States history , populism refers to popular engagement of the population in political decision making . An approach associated with the political scientist Ernesto Laclau presents populism as an emancipatory social force through which marginalised groups challenge dominant power structures .",

  "/wiki/Anti-Zionism": "Anti-Zionism is opposition to Zionism . The term is broadly defined in the modern era as opposition to the State of Israel or , prior to 1948 , its establishment . It has also been defined as opposition to the political movement of Jews to self-determination within the territory variously referred to as the Land of Israel , Palestine , Canaan , or the Holy Land . The term is used to describe various religious , moral and political points of view , but their diversity of motivation and expression is sufficiently different that anti-Zionism can not be seen as having a single ideology or source . There is also a difference between how it is discussed philosophically and how it is enacted within a political or social campaign . Some sources take the view that anti-Zionism has become a cover for modern-day antisemitism , a position that critics have challenged as a tactic to silence criticism of Israeli policies . Others , such as Steven M. Cohen , Brian Klug and Todd Gitlin , see no correlation between the two .",

  "/wiki/Secularism": "Secularism , as defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary , is indifference to , or rejection or exclusion of , religion and religious considerations . In certain contexts , the word can connote anticlericalism , atheism , desire to exclude religion from social activities or civic affairs , banishment of religious symbols from the public sphere , state neutrality toward religion , the separation of religion from state , or disestablishment ( separation of church and state ) . As a philosophy , secularism seeks to interpret life on principles taken solely from the material world , without recourse to religion . Secularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as Zeno of Citium and Marcus Aurelius ; from Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke , Denis Diderot , Voltaire , Baruch Spinoza , James Madison , Thomas Jefferson , and Thomas Paine ; and from more recent freethinkers atheists such as Matthew W. Dillahunty , Robert Ingersoll , Bertrand Russell , and Christopher Hitchens . It shifts the focus from religion to other temporal and this-worldly things , with emphasis on nature , reason , science , and development . In political terms , secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institutions and religious dignitaries ( the attainment of such is termed secularity ) . Defined briefly , secularism means that governments should remain neutral on the matter of religion and should not enforce nor prohibit the free exercise of religion , leaving religious choice to the liberty of the people . One form of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings , or , in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief , from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people . [ Notes 1 ] Another form of secularism is the view that public activities and decisions , especially political ones , should be uninfluenced by religious beliefs or practices . [ Notes 2 ] There exist distinct traditions of secularism in the West ( e.g. , French and Anglo-American ) and beyond ( e.g. , in India ) . The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely . In European laicism , it has been argued that secularism is a movement toward modernization , and away from traditional religious values ( also known as secularization ) .",

  "/wiki/Lebanese_nationalism": "Lebanese nationalism is a nationalistic ideology that considers the Lebanese people are a distinct nation independent from the Arab world . It considers the Lebanese people to be direct descendants of the Phoenician people . Supporters of this theory of Lebanese ethnogenesis maintain that the Lebanese are descended from Phoenicians . This ideology has its roots in the 19th century sectarian wars in Mount Lebanon between the Maronites and Druze . [ citation needed ] It took its formalized form during the inter-war period and the French Mandate of Syria , when it served primarily as a tool in opposing Arab nationalism and in justifying the existence of the nascent country of Lebanon . During the 20th century and the Lebanese Civil War , Lebanese nationalism was associated with the Kataeb Party , Lebanese Forces , National Liberal Party and secularist movements like Guardians of the Cedars and the Lebanese Renewal Party , spearheaded by the renowned late Lebanese poet and philosopher Said Akl . The Lebanese nationalism goes even further and incorporates irredentist views going beyond the Lebanese borders , seeking to unify all the lands of ancient Phoenicia around present day Lebanon . This comes from the fact that present day Lebanon , the Mediterranean coast of Syria , and northern Israel is the area that roughly corresponds to ancient Phoenicia and as a result the majority of the Lebanese people identify with the ancient Phoenician population of that region . Therefore , the proposed Greater Lebanese country includes Lebanon , Mediterranean coast of Syria , and northern Israel . The cultural and linguistic heritage of the Lebanese people is a blend of both indigenous elements and the foreign cultures that have come to rule the land and its people over the course of thousands of years . In a 2013 interview the lead investigator , Pierre Zalloua , pointed out that genetic variation preceded religious variation and divisions : Lebanon already had well-differentiated communities with their own genetic peculiarities , but not significant differences , and religions came as layers of paint on top . There is no distinct pattern that shows that one community carries significantly more Phoenician than another .",

The ideology is officially based on the theories of the Syrian intellectuals Michel Aflaq ( per the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party ) , Zaki al-Arsuzi ( per the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party ) , and Salah al-Din al-Bitar . A Ba'athist society seeks enlightenment , renaissance of Arab culture , values and society .

Ba'athists contend that socialism is the only way to develop an Arab society which is free and united . The two Ba'athist states which have existed ( Iraq and Syria ) prevented criticism of their ideology through authoritarian means of governance . These states have been labelled as neo-Ba'athist as opposed to Ba'athist because the form of Ba'athism developed in Iraq and Syria was quite distinct from the Ba'athism about which Aflaq and al-Bitar wrote .",

  "/wiki/Left-wing_populism": "Left-wing populism , or social populism , is a political ideology that combines left-wing politics and populist rhetoric and themes . The rhetoric of left-wing populism often consists of anti-elitist sentiments , opposition to the Establishment and speaking for the common people . The important themes for left-wing populists usually include anti-capitalism , social justice , pacifism and anti-globalization , whereas class society ideology or socialist theory is not as important as it is to traditional left-wing parties . The criticism of capitalism and globalization is linked to anti-militarism , which has increased in the left populist movements as a result of unpopular United States military operations , especially those in the Middle East . It is considered that the populist left does not exclude others horizontally and relies on egalitarian ideals . Some scholars point out nationalist left-wing populist movements as well , a feature exhibited by Kemalism in Turkey for instance or the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela . For left-wing populist parties supportive of minority rights among others , the term inclusionary populism has been used . With the rise of Greek Syriza and Spanish Podemos during the European debt crisis , there has been increased debate on new left-wing populism in Europe ."
