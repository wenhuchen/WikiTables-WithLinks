  "/wiki/The_Beast_of_Yucca_Flats": "The Beast of Yucca Flats ( released to television as Atomic Monster : The Beast of Yucca Flats ) is a 1961 B-movie horror film written and directed by Coleman Francis . It was produced by Anthony Cardoza , Roland Morin and Jim Oliphant . The film stars Swedish former wrestler Tor Johnson as the Beast . It starred Anthony Cardoza , Coleman Francis and Jim Oliphant in bit parts , as well as Conrad Brooks in a very small role . Director Francis cast his two sons ( Ronald and Alan Francis ) in the film as the two lost boys . The plot concerns a Soviet scientist named Joseph Jaworsky ( Tor Johnson ) , who defects and flees to a Nevada Test Site called Yucca Flats , only to be turned into a mindless monster by atomic radiation , stalking the desert . The film has very little dialogue and most of the speech is done by omniscient narration . Some critics have characterized the film as one of the worst science fiction horror films made , and one of the all-time worst films of any kind , even suggesting that it may be worse than Ed Wood 's legendarily bad Plan 9 from Outer Space . In 1995 , the television comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000 featured The Beast of Yucca Flats , helping the film develop a cult status .",

Hallmarks of Francis ' films include preoccupation with light aircraft and parachuting , coffee or cigarettes serving as props or centers of conversation and vigilante-style gunning down of suspects without trial at the films ' conclusions . Francis and his films have gained a cult status as a result of their appearances on the comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000 , where they became infamous for their poor production values , repetitive plot devices , meandering and incomprehensible storylines , and stilted acting . Some critics have characterized Francis as being the worst director of all-time , even suggesting that he may surpass Ed Wood in terms of ineptitude .",

  "/wiki/Terence_Fisher": "Terence Fisher ( 23 February 1904 - 18 June 1980 ) was a British film director best known for his work for Hammer Films . He was the first to bring gothic horror alive in full colour , and the sexual overtones and explicit horror in his films , while mild by modern standards , were unprecedented in his day . His first major gothic horror film was The Curse of Frankenstein ( 1957 ) , which launched Hammer 's association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era . He went on to film several adaptations of classic horror subjects , including Dracula ( 1958 ) , The Mummy ( 1959 ) , and The Curse of the Werewolf ( 1961 ) . Given their subject matter and lurid approach , Fisher 's films , though commercially successful , were largely dismissed by critics during his career . It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an auteur in his own right . His most famous films are characterised by a blend of fairytale myth and the supernatural alongside themes of sexuality , morality , and the charm of evil . Drawing heavily on a Christian conservative outlook , there is often a hero who defeats the powers of darkness by a combination of faith in God and reason , in contrast to other characters , who are either blindly superstitious or bound by cold , godless rationalism .

  "/wiki/The_Innocents_(1961_film)": "The Innocents is a 1961 British psychological horror film directed and produced by Jack Clayton , and starring Deborah Kerr , Michael Redgrave , and Megs Jenkins . Based on the novella The Turn of the Screw by the American novelist Henry James , the screenplay was adapted by William Archibald and Truman Capote , who used Archibald 's own stage play - also titled The Innocents - as a primary source text . Its plot follows a governess who watches over two children and comes to fear that their large estate is haunted by ghosts and that the children are being possessed . Archibald 's original screenplay for The Innocents was based on the premise that the paranormal events depicted were legitimate . Displeased with Archibald 's take on the material , director Jack Clayton appointed American writer Truman Capote to rework the script . Capote 's rewrites incorporated psychological themes , resulting in a final work that suggests other alternatives to the plot . Filming took place partly on location at the Gothic mansion of Sheffield Park in Sussex , with additional shoots occurring at Shepperton Studios in Surrey . Shot in CinemaScope , The Innocents incorporated bold minimal lighting as well as deep focus , employed by cinematographer Freddie Francis to achieve a distinctive - and sometimes claustrophobic - atmosphere . The film also pioneered the use of synthesised electronic sound created by Daphne Oram . The Innocents received international distribution from the American film studio 20th Century Fox , and received its London premiere on 24 November 1961 . It was released in the United States the following month on 15 December in Los Angeles and Christmas Day in New York City .

He rapidly rose through a series of increasingly important roles in British film production , before shooting to international prominence as a director with his Oscar-winning feature film debut , the drama Room at the Top ( 1959 ) ; this was followed by the much-lauded horror film The Innocents ( 1961 ) , adapted from Henry James ' The Turn of the Screw . Clayton looked set for a brilliant future , and he was highly regarded by peers and critics alike , but a number of overlapping factors hampered his career . He was a notably 'choosy ' director , who by his own admission never made a film I did n't want to make , and he repeatedly turned down films ( including Alien ) that became huge hits for other directors . But he was also dogged by bad luck and bad timing - the Hollywood studios labelled him as 'difficult ' , and studio politics quashed a string of planned films in the 1970s , which were either taken out of his hands , or cancelled in the final stages of preparation . In 1977 , he suffered a double blow - his current film was cancelled just two weeks before shooting was due to begin , and a few months later he suffered a serious stroke which robbed him of the ability to speak , and put his career on hold for five years . Despite his relatively small oeuvre , the films of Jack Clayton continue to be appreciated , and both they and their director have been widely admired and praised by leading film critics like Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert , and by film industry peers including Harold Pinter , Martin Scorsese , Guillermo del Toro , Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , Tennessee Williams and Steven Spielberg .",

The screenplay by Richard Matheson was loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe 's 1842 short story of the same name . Set in sixteenth-century Spain , the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister 's mysterious death . After a series of horrific revelations , apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths , the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film 's climactic sequence . The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by American International Pictures , the first having been Corman 's House of Usher released the previous year . Like House , the film features widescreen cinematography by Floyd Crosby , sets designed by art director Daniel Haller , and a film score composed by Les Baxter . A critical and box-office hit , Pit 's success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films , five of them starring Price . The series ended in 1965 with the release of The Tomb of Ligeia . Film critic Tim Lucas and writer Ernesto Gastaldi have both noted the film 's strong influence on numerous subsequent Italian thrillers , from Mario Bava 's The Whip and the Body ( 1963 ) to Dario Argento 's Deep Red ( 1975 ) .
