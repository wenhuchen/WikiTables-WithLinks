  "/wiki/Winston_Churchill": "Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill ( 30 November 1874 - 24 January 1965 ) was a British politician , army officer , and writer . He was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 , when he led Britain to victory in the Second World War , and again from 1951 to 1955 . Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) . Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist , for most of his career he was a member of the Conservative Party , which he led from 1940 to 1955 , but from 1904 to 1924 was a member of the Liberal Party . Of mixed English and American parentage , Churchill was born in Oxfordshire to a wealthy , aristocratic family . He joined the British Army in 1895 , and saw action in British India , the Anglo-Sudan War , and the Second Boer War , gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns . Elected an MP in 1900 , initially as a Conservative , he defected to the Liberals in 1904 . In H. H. Asquith 's Liberal government , Churchill served as President of the Board of Trade , Home Secretary , and First Lord of the Admiralty , championing prison reform and workers ' social security . During the First World War , he oversaw the Gallipoli Campaign ; after it proved a disaster , he resigned from government and served in the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front . In 1917 , he returned to government under David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions , then as Secretary of State for War and Air , and finally for the Colonies , overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and Britain 's Middle East policy . After two years out of Parliament , he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin 's Conservative government , returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity , a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy . Out of office during the 1930s , Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat from Nazi Germany .",

He studied at Oswestry School and Worksop College before attending Goldsmiths College , London and the Royal Academy of Arts . During the Second World War he served in the Burma Campaign . From 1964 he taught sculpture at Goldsmiths , University of London . He received his first full-scale commission in 1964 for the memorial sculpture of the Bohemian British painter Augustus John ( 1878-1961 ) . This sculpture took three years to complete and required major alteration ( from a double sculpture of John and his wife Dorelia ) due to limitation of funds . Nonetheless , the final 1967 single-figure sculpture was dramatically successful and led to Roberts-Jones ' election as an Associate of the Royal Academy . This sculpture was erected in Fordingbridge , Hampshire , near John 's last home . In 1971 he was commissioned to produce the full-length statue of Winston Churchill which now stands in Parliament Square , London . The organiser of the appeal to raise money for the statue did not like its initial appearance , and reported : At the moment the head is undoubtedly like Churchill , but perhaps not quite right of him at the pinnacle of his career .",

He was the final Liberal to hold the post . Lloyd George was born in Manchester to Welsh parents . His father - a schoolmaster - died in 1864 and he was raised in Wales by his mother and her shoemaker brother , whose Liberal politics and Baptist faith strongly influenced Lloyd George ; the same uncle helped the boy embark on a career as a solicitor after leaving school . Lloyd George became active in local politics , gaining a reputation as an orator and a proponent of a Welsh blend of radical Liberalism which championed nonconformism and the disestablishment of the Anglican church in Wales , equality for labourers and tenant farmers , and reform of landownership . In 1890 he narrowly won a by-election to become the Member of Parliament for Caernarvon Boroughs , in which seat he remained for fifty-five years . Lloyd George served in Henry Campbell-Bannerman 's cabinet from 1905 . After H. H. Asquith succeeded to the premiership in 1908 Lloyd George replaced him as Chancellor of the Exchequer . To fund extensive welfare reforms he proposed taxes on land ownership and high incomes in the People 's Budget ( 1909 ) , which the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected . The resulting constitutional crisis was only resolved after two elections in 1910 and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911 . His budget was then enacted alongside the National Insurance Act 1911 which helped to establish the modern welfare state . In 1913 he was embroiled in the Marconi scandal , but he remained in office and promoted the disestablishment of the Church in Wales , until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 suspended its implementation .",

He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1997 to 2007 . Brown was a Member of Parliament ( MP ) from 1983 to 2015 , first for Dunfermline East and later for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath . A doctoral graduate of the University of Edinburgh , Brown spent his early career working as both a lecturer at a further education college and a television journalist . He entered Parliament in 1983 as the MP for Dunfermline East . He joined the Shadow Cabinet in 1989 as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade , and was later promoted to become Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1992 . After Labour 's victory in 1997 , he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer , becoming the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history . Brown 's time as Chancellor was marked by major reform of Britain 's monetary and fiscal policy architecture , transferring interest rate setting powers to the Bank of England , by a wide extension of the powers of the Treasury to cover much domestic policy and by transferring responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority . Controversial moves included the abolition of advance corporation tax ( ACT ) relief in his first budget , and the removal in his final budget of the 10% starting rate of personal income tax which he had introduced in 1999 . Tony Blair resigned as Prime Minister and Labour Leader in 2007 , and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election . After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister , Labour 's popularity declined with the onset of a recession in 2008 , leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009 . A year later , Labour lost 91 seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election , the party 's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931 , making the Conservatives the largest party in a hung parliament .",

The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 ( Sanskrit : great-souled , venerable ) , first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa , is now used throughout the world . Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat , western India , Gandhi was trained in law at the Inner Temple , London , and called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891 . After two uncertain years in India , where he was unable to start a successful law practice , he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit . He went on to stay for 21 years . It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family , and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights . In 1915 , aged 45 , he returned to India . He set about organising peasants , farmers , and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination . Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 , Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty , expanding women 's rights , building religious and ethnic amity , ending untouchability , and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule . The same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth , or short dhoti and , in the winter , a shawl , both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel , or charkha , as a mark of identification with India 's rural poor . Thereafter , he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community , ate simple vegetarian food , and undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification and political protest . Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians , Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km ( 250 mi ) Dandi Salt March in 1930 , and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942 .",

The movement spanned a total of 90 years ( 1857-1947 ) . The first nationalistic revolutionary movement emerged from Bengal . It later took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking only their fundamental right to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India , as well as more rights , economical in nature , for the people of the soil . The early part of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards political self-rule proposed by leaders such as the Lal , Bal , Pal triumvirate , and Aurobindo Ghosh , V. O. Chidambaram Pillai . The last stages of the self-rule struggle from the 1920s onwards saw Congress adopt Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi 's policy of non-violence and civil disobedience , and several other campaigns . Nationalists like Subhash Chandra Bose , Bhagat Singh , Bagha Jatin , Surya Sen preached armed revolution to achieve self-rule . Poets and writers such as Vinayak Damodar Savarkar , Subramania Bharati , Rabindranath Tagore , Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Kazi Nazrul Islam used literature , poetry , and speech as a tool for political awareness . Feminists such as Sarojini Naidu promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in national politics . B. R. Ambedkar championed the cause of the disadvantaged sections of Indian society within the more significant self-rule movement . The period of the World War II saw the peak of the campaigns by the Quit India Movement led by Congress and the Indian National Army movement led by Subhash Chandra Bose with the help of Japan .

  "/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom": "The prime minister of the United Kingdom ( informally abbreviated to PM ) , until 1801 known as the prime minister of Great Britain , is the head of government of the United Kingdom . The prime minister directs both the executive and the legislature , and together with their Cabinet is accountable to the monarch , to Parliament , to their party , and ultimately to the electorate , for the government 's policies and actions . The office of Prime Minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists only by long-established convention , whereby the reigning monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber . The position of Prime Minister was not created ; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament , political developments , and accidents of history . The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective . The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement ( 1688-1720 ) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament . Although the sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government , politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a prime minister who could command a majority in Parliament . By the 1830s , the Westminster system of government ( or cabinet government ) had emerged ; the prime minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom . The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties , the introduction of mass communication and photography . By the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged ; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-\u00e0-vis the Sovereign , Parliament and Cabinet . Prior to 1902 , the prime minister sometimes came from the House of Lords , provided that his government could form a majority in the Commons . However as the power of the aristocracy waned during the 19th century the convention developed that the prime minister should always sit as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) in the lower house , making them answerable only to the Commons in Parliament .",

From 1931 to 1935 , he headed a National Government dominated by the Conservative Party and supported by only a few Labour members . MacDonald was later vehemently denounced by and expelled from the party he had helped to found . MacDonald , along with Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson , was one of the three principal founders of the Labour Party . He was chairman of the Labour MPs before 1914 and , after an eclipse in his career caused by his opposition to the First World War , he was Leader of the Labour Party from 1922 . The second Labour Government ( 1929-31 ) was dominated by the Great Depression . He formed the National Government to carry out spending cuts to defend the gold standard , but it had to be abandoned after the Invergordon Mutiny , and he called a general election in 1931 seeking a doctor 's mandate to fix the economy . The National coalition won an overwhelming landslide and the Labour Party was reduced to a rump of around 50 seats in the House of Commons . His health deteriorated and he stood down as Prime Minister in 1935 , remaining as Lord President of the Council until retiring in 1937 . He died later that year . MacDonald 's speeches , pamphlets and books made him an important theoretician . Historian John Shepherd states that MacDonald 's natural gifts of an imposing presence , handsome features and a persuasive oratory delivered with an arresting Highlands accent made him the iconic Labour leader .",

Women were not explicitly banned from voting in Great Britain until the Reform Act 1832 and the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 .

As well as in England , women 's suffrage movements in Wales and other parts of the United Kingdom gained momentum . The movements shifted sentiments in favour of woman suffrage by 1906 . It was at this point that the militant campaign began with the formation of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) . The outbreak of the First World War on 4 August 1914 led to a suspension of party politics , including the militant suffragette campaigns . Lobbying did take place quietly . In 1918 a coalition government passed the Representation of the People Act 1918 , enfranchising all men over 21 , as well as all women over the age of 30 who met minimum property qualifications . This act was the first to include almost all adult men in the political system and began the inclusion of women , extending the franchise by 5.6 million men and 8.4 million women .",

She died after being hit by King George V 's horse Anmer at the 1913 Derby when she walked onto the track during the race . Davison grew up in a middle-class family , and studied at Royal Holloway College , London , and St Hugh 's College , Oxford , before taking jobs as a teacher and governess . She joined the WSPU in November 1906 and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches . She soon became known in the organisation for her daring militant action ; her tactics included breaking windows , throwing stones , setting fire to postboxes and , on three occasions , hiding overnight in the Palace of Westminster - including on the night of the 1911 census . Her funeral on 14 June 1913 was organised by the WSPU . A procession of 5,000 suffragettes and their supporters accompanied her coffin and 50,000 people lined the route through London ; her coffin was then taken by train to the family plot in Morpeth , Northumberland . Davison was a staunch feminist and passionate Christian , and considered that socialism was a moral and political force for good . Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death . She gave no prior explanation for what she planned to do at the Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history . Several theories have been put forward , including accident , suicide , or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king 's horse ."
