  "/wiki/Opera": "Opera is a form of theatre in which music has a leading role and the parts are taken by singers , but is distinct from musical theater . Such a work ( the literal translation of Italian word opera ) is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts , such as acting , scenery , costume , and sometimes dance or ballet . The performance is typically given in an opera house , accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble , which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor . Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition . Originally understood as an entirely sung piece , in contrast to a play with songs , opera has come to include numerous genres , including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theater , Singspiel and Op\u00e9ra comique . In traditional number opera , singers employ two styles of singing : recitative , a speech-inflected style , and self-contained arias . The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama . Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century ( with Jacopo Peri 's mostly lost Dafne , produced in Florence in 1598 ) and soon spread through the rest of Europe : Heinrich Sch\u00fctz in Germany , Jean-Baptiste Lully in France , and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century . In the 18th century , Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe ( except France ) , attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel . Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera , until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his reform operas in the 1760s . The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas , especially The Marriage of Figaro ( Le nozze di Figaro ) , Don Giovanni , and Cos\u00ec fan tutte , as well as Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail ( The Abduction from the Seraglio ) , and The Magic Flute ( Die Zauberfl\u00f6te ) , landmarks in the German tradition . The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style , with Gioachino Rossini , Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating works that are still performed .",

It is a Zeitoper , a genre of music theatre which used contemporary settings and characters , satiric plots which often include technology and machinery . Musically the Zeitoper genre tends to be eclectic and borrow from Jazz . The genre has practically disappeared from the world 's opera houses . Historically the Zeitoper came to an abrupt end with the Nazi period , and after the war the cultural institutions were perhaps hesitant to return to the lighter , often decadent and comic operas written before the holocaust changed the artistic perspective .

  "/wiki/Opera_buffa": "Opera buffa ( Italian : [ \u02c8\u0254\u02d0pera \u02c8buf\u02d0a ] ; comic opera , plural : opere buffe ) is a genre of opera . It was first used as an informal description of Italian comic operas variously classified by their authors as commedia in musica , commedia per musica , dramma bernesco , dramma comico , divertimento giocoso . Especially associated with developments in Naples in the first half of the 18th century , whence its popularity spread to Rome and northern Italy , buffa was at first characterized by everyday settings , local dialects , and simple vocal writing ( the basso buffo is the associated voice type ) , the main requirement being clear diction and facility with patter . The New Grove Dictionary of Opera considers La Cilla ( music by Michelangelo Faggioli , text by Francesco Antonio Tullio [ it ] , 1706 ) and Luigi and Federico Ricci 's Crispino e la comare ( 1850 ) to be the first and last appearances of the genre , although the term is still occasionally applied to newer work ( for example Ernst Krenek 's Zeitoper Schwergewicht ) . High points in this history are the 80 or so libretti by Carlindo Grolo , Loran Glodici , Sogol Cardoni and various other approximate anagrams of Carlo Goldoni , the three Mozart/Da Ponte collaborations , and the comedies of Gioachino Rossini and Gaetano Donizetti . Similar foreign genres such as op\u00e9ra comique or Singspiel differed as well in having spoken dialogue in place of recitativo secco , although one of the most influential examples , Pergolesi 's La serva padrona ( which is an intermezzo , not opera buffa ) , sparked the querelle des bouffons in Paris as an adaptation without sung recitatives .",

  "/wiki/The_Beggar's_Opera": "The Beggar 's Opera is a ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by John Gay with music arranged by Johann Christoph Pepusch . It is one of the watershed plays in Augustan drama and is the only example of the once thriving genre of satirical ballad opera to remain popular today . Ballad operas were satiric musical plays that used some of the conventions of opera , but without recitative . The lyrics of the airs in the piece are set to popular broadsheet ballads , opera arias , church hymns and folk tunes of the time . The Beggar 's Opera premiered at the Lincoln 's Inn Fields Theatre on 29 January 1728 and ran for 62 consecutive performances , the second longest run in theatre history up to that time ( after 146 performances of Robert Cambert 's Pomone in Paris in 1671 ) . The work became Gay 's greatest success and has been played ever since ; it has been called the most popular play of the eighteenth century . In 1920 , The Beggar 's Opera began a revival run of 1,463 performances at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith , London , which was one of the longest runs in history for any piece of musical theatre at that time . The piece satirised Italian opera , which had become popular in London . According to The New York Times : Gay wrote the work more as an anti-opera than an opera , one of its attractions to its 18th-century London public being its lampooning of the Italian opera style and the English public 's fascination with it . Instead of the grand music and themes of opera , the work uses familiar tunes and characters that were ordinary people . Some of the songs were by opera composers like Handel , but only the most popular of these were used . The audience could hum along with the music and identify with the characters .",

Among his honours were the CBE in 1952 , the Queen 's Gold Medal for Poetry in 1953 , and he was invested as a Companion of Honour in 1956 . Although highly learned , Waley avoided academic posts and most often wrote for a general audience . He chose not to be a specialist but to translate a wide and personal range of classical literature . Starting in the 1910s and continuing steadily almost until his death in 1966 , these translations started with poetry , such as A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems ( 1918 ) and Japanese Poetry : The Uta ( 1919 ) , then an equally wide range of novels , such as The Tale of Genji ( 1925-26 ) , an 11th-century Japanese work , and Monkey , from 16th-century China . Waley also presented and translated Chinese philosophy , wrote biographies of literary figures , and maintained a lifelong interest in both Asian and Western paintings . A recent evaluation called Waley the great transmitter of the high literary cultures of China and Japan to the English-reading general public ; the ambassador from East to West in the first half of the 20th century , and went on to say that he was self-taught , but reached remarkable levels of fluency , even erudition , in both languages .

Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably , n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen . Traditionally , a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between ; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today . Optionally , an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation . Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story . Noh integrates masks , costumes and various props in a dance-based performance , requiring highly trained actors and musicians . Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts , women , children , and the elderly . Written in late middle Japanese , the text vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries .
