  "/wiki/Bandura": "A bandura ( Ukrainian : \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0301\u0440\u0430 ) is a Ukrainian , plucked string , folk instrument . It combines elements of the zither and lute and , up until the 1940s , was also often referred to by the term kobza . Early instruments ( c. 1700 ) had 5 to 12 strings and similar to the lute . In the 20th century , the number of strings increased initially to 31 strings ( 1926 ) , 56 strings - 68 strings on modern 'concert ' instruments ( 1954 ) . Musicians who play the bandura are referred to as bandurists . In the 19th - early 20th century traditional bandura players , often blind , were referred to as kobzars . It is suggested that the instrument developed as a hybrid of gusli ( Eastern-European psaltery ) and kobza ( Eastern-European lute ) and although the term bandura can date itself to Polish chronicles from 1441 , this hybridization occurred in the late 18th or early 19th centuries .",

Kapustin studied piano with Avrelian Rubakh ( a pupil of Felix Blumenfeld , who also taught Simon Barere and Vladimir Horowitz ) and subsequently with Alexander Goldenweiser at the Moscow Conservatory . During the 1950s he acquired a reputation as a jazz pianist , arranger and composer . Thus he is steeped in the traditions of both classical virtuoso pianism and improvisational jazz . He fuses these influences in his compositions , using jazz idioms in formal classical structures . An example of this is his Suite in the Old Style , Op . 28 , written in 1977 , which inhabits the sound world of jazz improvisation but is modelled on baroque suites such as the keyboard partitas composed by J. S. Bach , each movement being a stylised dance or a pair of dances in strict binary form . Other examples of this fusion are his set of 24 Preludes and Fugues , Op . 82 , written in 1997 , and the Op . 100 Sonatina . Kapustin regards himself as a composer rather than a jazz musician . He has said , I was never a jazz musician .",
