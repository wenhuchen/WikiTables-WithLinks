Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the U.S. government , leading Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state 's land owned by the federal government . Federal lands include two national parks - Grand Teton and Yellowstone - two national recreation areas , two national monuments , several national forests , historic sites , fish hatcheries , and wildlife refuges . Original inhabitants of the region include the Crow , Arapaho , Lakota , and Shoshone . Southwestern Wyoming was claimed by the Spanish Empire and then Mexican territory until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican-American War . The region acquired the name Wyoming when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress in 1865 to provide a temporary government for the territory of Wyoming . The name was used earlier for the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania , and is derived from the Munsee word xw\u00e9 : wam\u0259nk , meaning at the big river flat .",

Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",
