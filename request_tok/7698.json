With less than 800 metres to go , Ugandan Benjamin Kiplagat got tangled up on a barrier and fell flat on his face , the runners behind him having to scramble . 200 metres later , Kenyan Brimin Kipruto fell . Though he quickly scrambled to his feet , that effectively ruined the chances for a Kenyan sweep . Still the other two led through the final lap . Former gold medalist and multiple world champion Ezekiel Kemboi pulled away off the front . As Abel Mutai began to falter , Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad sprinted past to repeat his silver medal .",
