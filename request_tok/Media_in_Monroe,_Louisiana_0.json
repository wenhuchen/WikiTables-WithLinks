  "/wiki/Digital_television": "Digital television ( DTV ) is the transmission of television audiovisual signals using digital encoding , in contrast to the earlier analog television technology which used analog signals . At the time of its development it was considered an innovative advancement and represented the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s . Modern digital television is transmitted in high definition ( HDTV ) with greater resolution than analog TV . It typically uses a widescreen aspect ratio ( commonly 16:9 ) in contrast to the narrower format of analog TV . It makes more economical use of scarce radio spectrum space ; it can transmit up to seven channels in the same bandwidth as a single analog channel , and provides many new features that analog television can not . A transition from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2000 . Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in different parts of the world ; below are the more widely used standards :",

The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc. , a collection of 16 radio stations purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System . Under Paley 's guidance , CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States , and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks . In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as CBS , Inc . The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1995 , renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting , Inc. in 1997 , and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation . In 2000 CBS came under the control of the first Viacom , which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971 . In late 2005 , Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television , radio , and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets , with the CBS television network at its core . CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements , which also controlled the second Viacom until December 4 , 2019 , when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS .",
