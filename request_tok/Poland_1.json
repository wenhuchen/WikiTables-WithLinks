In 1742 the First Silesian War transferred Upper Silesia , including Katowice , to Prussia . Subsequently , from the second half of the 18th century , many German or Prussian craftsmen , merchants and artists began to settle in the region , which had been inhabited mostly by Poles over the past hundreds of years . Simultaneously Silesia experienced the influx of the first Jewish settlers . In the first half of the 19th century , intensive industrialization transformed local mills and farms into industrial steelworks , mines , foundries and artisan workshops . This also contributed to the establishment of companies and eventual rapid growth of the city . At the same time , Katowice became linked to the railway system with the first train arriving at the main station in 1847 . The outbreak of World War I was favourable for Katowice due to the prospering steel industry . Following Germany 's defeat and the Silesian Uprisings , Katowice and parts of Upper Silesia were annexed by the Second Polish Republic .",
