  "/wiki/Fort_Frederik": "Fort Frederik , also known as Frederiksfort , is a U.S. National Historic Landmark in Frederiksted , United States Virgin Islands . It was built between 1752 and 1760 by Denmark-Norway to defend the economic interests of the natural deep water port of Frederiksted and to ward off pirates . It has red and white painted walls , making it quite different then yellow and white of Fort Christiansv\u00e6rn on the other side of the island . It is located at the north end of Frederiksted , in St. Croix , south of the junction of Mahogany Road and VI 631 . It should not be confused with Frederiks Fort , Fortberg Hill , on St. John , which is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places . According to Westergaard , It was soon found that a customs house was not sufficient , but that cannon must be provided , and placed as to command the roads where the ships lay anchored . In lack of such a 'water battery ' , ships were accustomed to slip away in the night-time without securing papers of paying their dues . In 1776 , the first salute from foreign soil to the new nation of the United States of America was fired from the fort . The salute of Old Glory which had been raised on an American brigantine at port in Frederiksted was a violation of the laws of Denmark-Norway 's neutrality however the islands had helped the British colonist in America sealing a friendliness between the two colonies , and the salute was therefore appropriate . It is from this fort that Danish Governor-General Peter von Scholten emancipated the slaves on 3 July 1848 . John Gottliff ( also known as Moses Gotlieb , General Bordeaux , or Buddhoe ) had led 8,000 blacks in a freedom march to Frederiksted . At the time , there were 17,000 slaves and 5,000 free blacks on St. Croix .",

  "/wiki/Blackbeard's_Castle": "Blackbeard 's Castle is one of five National Historic Landmarks in the U.S. Virgin Islands . It is located in the city of Charlotte Amalie , on the island of St. Thomas . Built in 1679 by the Danes as a watchtower to protect the harbor as well as Fort Christian . Blackbeard 's Castle was originally called Skytsborg ( meaning protection castle ) . It is located at the highest point on Government Hill . Skytsborg served as a very effective vantage point for Danish soldiers to spot enemy ships . Fort Christian is at sea level , thus making it ideal for thwarting attackers with cannon fire ; however , the fort itself did not provide an ideal view of incoming ships entering the harbor . It is not known what year Skytsborg took on the name of Blackbeard 's Castle , but the infamous Edward Teach , commonly known as Blackbeard , did sail the Caribbean waters in the early 18th century . It has become part of the lore of the island that he used the tower as a lookout for his own purposes of piracy . It was the centerpiece of a private residence for many years , and was turned into a hotel , but is no longer open to the public .",
