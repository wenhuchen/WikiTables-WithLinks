  "/wiki/Church_of_Christ_(Temple_Lot)": "The Church of Christ , informally called Hedrickites and the Church of Christ ( Temple Lot ) , is a denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement headquartered in Independence , Missouri , on what is known as the Temple Lot . The nickname for members of the church comes from the surname of Granville Hedrick , who was ordained as the church 's leader in July 1863 . Unlike The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) and Community of Christ , the Temple Lot church rejects the office of prophet or president , being instead led by its Quorum of Twelve Apostles . The church also rejects the doctrines of baptism for the dead and celestial marriage promulgated by the Utah-based LDS Church , as well as the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price . While once avidly engaged in dialogue with other Latter Day Saint factions , the church no longer has any official contact with any other organization . It is notable for its sole ownership of the Temple Lot , which it has held for nearly 150 years . As of 2013 , membership is 7,310 members in 11 countries . Most of the members live in the United States , but there are parishes in Canada , Mexico , Honduras , Nigeria , Kenya , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Malawi , Tanzania , India , and the Philippines .",
  "/wiki/Granville_Hedrick": "Granville Hedrick ( September 2 , 1814 - August 22 , 1881 ) was a leader in the Latter Day Saint movement after the 1844 succession crisis . In 1863 , Hedrick became the founding leader of the Church of Christ ( Temple Lot ) , which is one of many churches that claim to be a continuation of the Church of Christ founded by Joseph Smith in 1830 .",
  "/wiki/Temple_Lot": "The Temple Lot , located in Independence , Jackson County , Missouri , is the first site to be dedicated for the construction of a temple in the Latter Day Saint movement . The area was dedicated on Wednesday , August 3 , 1831 by the movement 's founder , Joseph Smith , Jr. , and purchased on December 19 , 1831 by his colleague Edward Partridge to be the center of the New Jerusalem or City of Zion after he received a revelation stating that it would be the gathering spot of the Saints during the Last Days . The most prominent 2.5-acre section of the Temple Lot is currently an open , grass-covered field occupied in its northeast corner by a few trees and the headquarters of the Church of Christ ( Temple Lot ) , which is not considered a temple by adherents of that sect . No other structures ( with the exception of monuments , markers and signposts ) exist on the 2.5-acre section , although numerous important structures exist on the 63.5-acre section , such as the United Nations Peace Plaza , the Community of Christ Auditorium , the Truman Railroad Depot , the LDS Visitors Center , the Community of Christ Temple , an LDS Church stake center , and the Six Nations Tree of Peace .",
  "/wiki/Church_of_Christ_(Fettingite)": "The Church of Christ , informally referred to as the Fettingites , is a denomination within the Latter Day Saint movement which split from the Church of Christ - informally known as Hedrickites - in late 1929 . The faction was formally established on April 8 , 1930 , and an Associated Press report published in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times April 7 , 1930 , describes it as having been briefly named The Church of Jesus Christ and later , the Church of Christ . It is informally referred to as the Church of Christ ( Fettingite ) , after its founder , Otto Fetting , but this sect has never officially been named as such . Otto Fetting , an Apostle in the Church of Christ , was the alleged recipient of a series of messages delivered by John the Baptist concerning construction of a temple on the Temple Lot , along with other aspects of Hedrickite doctrine and practice . The rejection of his Twelfth Message by a majority vote of his fellow Apostles in October 1929 led to a split in the Temple Lot organization between those who rejected Fetting 's messages and those who accepted them . The Fettingites subsequently established their own church organization . While Fettingite doctrine and practices are virtually identical to those of the Church of Christ , a significant difference exists today in the acceptance of the messages ' authenticity between Hedrickites and Fettingites . The Hedrickite leadership voted at their April , 1936 conference to formally reject Otto Fetting 's claim of having heard from John the Baptist , but some laity in the Hedrickite sect have informally expressed interest or belief in his claims , to where about a half-dozen Hedrickites [ who ? ] today believe Fetting received some or all of the revelations he claimed . After its founder 's death in 1933 , the Fettingite sect further divided into various factions , including The Church of Christ ( Restored ) , the Church of Christ at Halley 's Bluff , and the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message . As with the Church of Christ , each of these groups declares itself to be the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth .",
  "/wiki/Otto_Fetting": "Otto Fetting ( November 20 , 1871 - January 30 , 1933 ) was an American realtor and editor from Port Huron , Michigan who served first as a pastor and evangelist in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , and then later as an apostle in the Church of Christ ( Temple Lot ) , commonly referred to as the Hedrickites . Fetting claimed to have been visited by John the Baptist thirty or more times between February 4 , 1927 and his death on January 30 , 1933 . Fetting was reportedly given instruction concerning the doctrine and practices of Hedrickites and other factions of Christianity , together with directives to begin construction of a temple on the Temple Lot , including its exact dimensions . After initially accepting his first eleven revelations , a Hedrickite conference vote in early October 1929 rejected a key portion of Fetting 's twelfth message , leading him to found the Church of Jesus Christ on April 8 , 1930 . This breakaway faction , later referred to as Church of Christ , subsequently gave birth to additional rival factions after Fetting 's death , which have still further subdivided . These Fettingite or Dravesite ( named after W.A . Draves , a follower of Fetting ) factions include : the Church of Christ With the Elijah Message Established Anew 1929 ; the Church of Christ ( Restored ) ; the Church of Christ ( Assured Way ) ; The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message , Established in 1929 Anew , The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message , Inc. and the Church of Christ at Halley 's Bluff .",
  "/wiki/John_the_Baptist": "John the Baptist [ note 1 ] ( late 1st century BC - 28-36 AD ) was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early 1st century AD . Other titles for John include John the Forerunner in Eastern Christianity , John the Immerser in some Baptist traditions , and the prophet John ( Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ) in Islam . He is sometimes alternatively called John the Baptizer . John the Baptist is mentioned by the Hebrew historian Josephus and revered as a major religious figure in Christianity , Islam , the Bah\u00e1 ' \u00ed Faith , and Mandaeism . He is called a prophet by all of these faiths , and is honored as a saint in many Christian traditions . According to the New Testament , John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself , and the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus , since John announces Jesus ' coming and prepares the people for Jesus ' ministry . Jesus himself identifies John as Elijah who is to come , which some biblical scholars interpret to mean that Jesus believed that John was the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Elijah , although John the Baptist in the Gospel of John explicitly denies being linked to Elijah ( John 1:21 ) . According to the New Testament , John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth were relatives . Some scholars maintain that John belonged to the Essenes , a semi-ascetic Judaic sect who expected a Hebrew messiah and who practiced ritual baptism . John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement . Most scholars agree that John baptized Jesus , and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus ' early followers had previously been followers of John . According to the New Testament John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas sometime between 28 and 36 AD after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife , Phasaelis , and then unlawfully wedding Herodias , the wife of his brother Herod Philip I .",
  "/wiki/Seventh_day_sabbatarianism": "The seventh-day Sabbath , observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening , is an important part of the beliefs and practices of seventh-day churches . These churches emphasize biblical references such as the ancient Hebrew practice of beginning a day at sundown , and the Genesis creation narrative wherein an evening and morning established a day , predating the giving of the Ten Commandments ( thus the command to remember the sabbath ) . They hold that the Old and New Testament show no variation in the doctrine of the Sabbath on the seventh day . Saturday , or the seventh day in the weekly cycle , is the only day in all of scripture designated using the term Sabbath . The seventh day of the week is recognized as Sabbath in many languages , calendars , and doctrines , including those of Catholic , Lutheran , and Orthodox churches . It is still observed in modern Judaism in relation to Mosaic Law . In addition , the Orthodox Tewahedo Churches uphold Sabbatarianism , observing the Sabbath on Saturday , in addition to the Lord 's Day on Sunday . Catholic , Orthodox , and some Protestant denominations observe the Lord 's Day on Sunday and hold that the Saturday Sabbath is no longer binding for Christians . On the other hand , Congregationalists , Presbyterians , Methodists , and Baptists , as well as many Episcopalians , have historically espoused the view of first-day Sabbatarianism , describing the Sabbath as being transferred to the Lord 's Day ( Sunday ) , the first day of the week , merged with the day of Christ 's resurrection , forming the Christian Sabbath . Seventh-day Sabbatarians are Christians who seek to reestablish the practice of some early Christians who kept the Sabbath according to normal Jewish practice . They usually believe that all humanity is obliged to keep the Ten Commandments , including the Sabbath , and that keeping all the commandments is a moral responsibility that honors , and shows love towards God as creator , sustainer , and redeemer . Christian seventh-day Sabbatarians , arising from Adventist groups in the Millerite tradition , hold beliefs similar to that tradition that the change of the sabbath was part of a Great Apostasy in the Christian faith .",
