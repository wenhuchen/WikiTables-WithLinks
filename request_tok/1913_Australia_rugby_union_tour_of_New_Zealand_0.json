Auckland is a diverse , multicultural and cosmopolitan city , home to the largest Polynesian population in the world . The M\u0101ori-language name for Auckland is T\u0101maki Makaurau , meaning T\u0101maki desired by many , in reference to the desirability of its natural resources and geography . Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf of the Pacific Ocean to the east , the low Hunua Ranges to the south-east , the Manukau Harbour to the south-west , and the Waitakere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west . The surrounding hills are covered in rainforest and the landscape is dotted with dozens of dormant volcanic cones . The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitemat\u0101 Harbour on the Pacific Ocean . Auckland is one of the few cities in the world to have a harbour on each of two separate major bodies of water . The isthmus on which Auckland resides was first settled around 1350 and was valued for its rich and fertile land . The M\u0101ori population in the area is estimated to have peaked at 20,000 before the arrival of Europeans .
