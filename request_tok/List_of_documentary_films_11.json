It 's because , from my point of view , our language is in a state of vast humiliation . It no longer describes the world in which we live . In the Hopi language , the word Koyaanisqatsi means unbalanced life . The film is the first in the Qatsi film trilogy : it is succeeded by Powaqqatsi ( 1988 ) and Naqoyqatsi ( 2002 ) .
