Its iconic neon sign , now found at the Museum of Vancouver , was a city landmark , and one of the most ornate pieces of neon signwork ever made in Vancouver .

The venue closed for good in 1993 , serving its last 16-17 years as Vancouver 's epicentre of punk rock .",
  "/wiki/54-40": "The Oregon boundary dispute or the Oregon Question was a territorial dispute over the political division of the Pacific Northwest of North America between several nations that had competing territorial and commercial aspirations over the region . Expansionist competition into the region began in the 18th century , with participants including the Russian Empire , the United Kingdom , Spain and the United States . By the 1820s , both the Russians , through the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the Russo-British Treaty of 1825 , and the Spanish , by the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 , formally withdrew their territorial claims in the region . Through these treaties the British and Americans gained residual territorial claims in the disputed area . The remaining portion of the North American Pacific coast contested by the United Kingdom and the United States was defined as the following : west of the Continental Divide of the Americas , north of Mexico 's Alta California border of 42nd parallel north , and south of Russian America at parallel 54\u00b040\u2032 north ; typically this region was referred to as the Columbia District by the British and the Oregon Country by the Americans . The Oregon dispute began to become important in geopolitical diplomacy between the British Empire and the new American republic , especially after the War of 1812 . In the 1844 U.S. presidential election , ending the Oregon Question by annexing the entire area was a position adopted by the Democratic Party . Some scholars have claimed the Whig Party 's lack of interest in the issue was due to its relative insignificance among other more pressing domestic problems . Democratic candidate James K. Polk appealed to the popular theme of manifest destiny and expansionist sentiment , defeating Whig Henry Clay . Polk sent the British government the previously offered partition along the 49th parallel . Subsequent negotiations faltered as the British plenipotentiaries still argued for a border along the Columbia River . Tensions grew as American expansionists like Senator Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana and Representative Leonard Henly Sims of Missouri , urged Polk to annex the entire Pacific Northwest to the 54\u00b040\u2032 parallel north , as the Democrats had called for in the election .",
