The Braves saw some success and reached the playoffs three times , led by league Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Bob McAdoo . Conflicts with the Canisius Golden Griffins over the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and the sale of the franchise led to their relocating from Buffalo , New York , to San Diego , California . In 1978 , upon relocating , the franchise was rebranded to be known as the San Diego Clippers , in reference to the sailing ships that can be seen in the San Diego Bay . The franchise saw limited success on the court in its six years in San Diego despite the acquisition of star center Bill Walton , who missed nearly three full seasons due to injury upon his arrival .

In 1984 , the franchise was controversially relocated to Los Angeles by Sterling without the approval of the NBA .
