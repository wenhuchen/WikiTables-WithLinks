  "/wiki/MV_Blythe_Star": "The vessel MV Blythe Star was a coastal freighter which foundered off south-western Tasmania in October 1973 , leading to the largest maritime search operation conducted in Australia to that time . No sign of the vessel was ever found . The crew of ten successfully took to a small inflatable liferaft , but it was not until after 11 days and the deaths of three seamen that the survivors were found ashore in rugged terrain near Deep Glen Bay on Tasmania 's south east coast . As a result of this tragedy , the AUSREP maritime position reporting system was introduced to the Australian Navigation Act .",
  "/wiki/South_West_Cape,_Tasmania": "The South West Cape is a cape located at the south-west corner of Tasmania , Australia .

The high point of the southern end of the range , closest to the cape is Mount Karamu at 439 m. The mount is named after the USS steam ship which foundered off the cape in 1925 . Wrecks and foundering of boats up to 500 kilometres ( 310 mi ) away in distance , are usually referred to this cape as an identification point , and mapping of the area usually uses the cape as a boundary between sections of the coast .",

It was a part of Esperance Municipality until 1993 when the municipality was merged with other municipalities to form Huon Valley Council . The island is home to the entire royal penguin population during their annual nesting season . Ecologically , the island is part of the Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra ecoregion . Since 1948 the Australian Antarctic Division ( AAD ) has maintained a permanent base , the Macquarie Island Station , on the isthmus at the northern end of the island at the foot of Wireless Hill . The population of the base , the island 's only human inhabitants , usually varies from 20 to 40 people over the year . A heliport is located near the base . In September 2016 , the Australian Antarctic Division said it would close its research station on the island in 2017 . However , shortly afterwards the Australian government responded to widespread backlash to the decision by announcing funding to upgrade ageing infrastructure and continue existing operations at Macquarie Island .",

She was on a voyage from Port Jackson to India . On August 1819 , Daphne , Captain Howard , sailed from Hobart for Port Jackson with wheat and potatoes . Daphne departed Sydney bound for India on 10 October 1819 under the command of John Howard .

Howard went ashore , probably to find sealers . On arriving on shore he noticed that Daphne was being driven towards the rocks . He returned on board but could do little to save the brig . He therefore ordered the passengers and crew to abandon ship . The passengers made it to shore safely but Daphne was totally destroyed .",
  "/wiki/Brig": "A brig is a sailing vessel with two square-rigged masts . During the Age of Sail , brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels . They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries . Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind . Their rigging differs from that of a brigantine which has a gaff-rigged mainsail , while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail .",

Weather conditions at the time were north-westerly 37-46 km/h ( 20-25 knot ) winds and two-metre seas . It grounded on Hebe Reef as it approached the mouth of the Tamar River and began leaking bunker fuel oil . The crew was safely evacuated . On 16 July the Iron Baron was refloated and moved to an offshore anchorage . Underwater inspections confirmed that it had incurred major structural damage and was continuing to deteriorate .

  "/wiki/Bulk_carrier": "A bulk carrier , bulker is a merchant ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo , such as grains , coal , ore , steel coils and cement , in its cargo holds . Since the first specialized bulk carrier was built in 1852 , economic forces have led to continued development of these ships , resulting in increased size and sophistication . Today 's bulk carriers are specially designed to maximize capacity , safety , efficiency , and durability . Today , bulk carriers make up 21% of the world 's merchant fleets and range in size from single-hold mini-bulk carriers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400,000 metric tons of deadweight ( DWT ) . A number of specialized designs exist : some can unload their own cargo , some depend on port facilities for unloading , and some even package the cargo as it is loaded . Over half of all bulk carriers have Greek , Japanese , or Chinese owners and more than a quarter are registered in Panama . South Korea is the largest single builder of bulk carriers , and 82% of these ships were built in Asia . On bulk carriers , crew are involved in operation management and maintenance of the vessel taking care of safety , navigation , maintenance and cargo care , in accordance with international maritime legislation . Cargo loading operations vary in complexity and loading and discharging of cargo can take several days . Bulk carriers can be gearless ( dependent upon terminal equipment ) or geared ( having cranes integral to the vessel ) . Crews can range in size from three people on the smallest ships to over 30 on the largest . Bulk cargo can be very dense , corrosive , or abrasive .",

The banks of the Derwent were once covered by forests and occupied by Tasmanian Aborigines . European settlers farmed the area and during the 20th century many dams were built on its tributaries for the generation of hydro-electricity . Agriculture , forestry , hydropower generation and fish hatcheries dominate catchment land use . The Derwent is also an important source of water for irrigation and water supply . Most of Hobart 's water supply is taken from the lower River Derwent . Nearly 40% of Tasmania 's population lives around the estuary 's margins and the Derwent is widely used for recreation , boating , recreational fishing , marine transportation and industry .",

  "/wiki/Icebreaker": "An icebreaker is a special-purpose ship or boat designed to move and navigate through ice-covered waters , and provide safe waterways for other boats and ships . Although the term usually refers to ice-breaking ships , it may also refer to smaller vessels , such as the icebreaking boats that were once used on the canals of the United Kingdom . For a ship to be considered an icebreaker , it requires three traits most normal ships lack : a strengthened hull , an ice-clearing shape , and the power to push through sea ice . Icebreakers clear paths by pushing straight into frozen-over water or pack ice . The bending strength of sea ice is low enough that the ice breaks usually without noticeable change in the vessel 's trim . In cases of very thick ice , an icebreaker can drive its bow onto the ice to break it under the weight of the ship . A buildup of broken ice in front of a ship can slow it down much more than the breaking of the ice itself , so icebreakers have a specially designed hull to direct the broken ice around or under the vessel . The external components of the ship 's propulsion system ( propellers , propeller shafts , etc . ) are at greater risk of damage than the vessel 's hull , so the ability of an icebreaker to propel itself onto the ice , break it , and clear the debris from its path successfully is essential for its safety .",

  "/wiki/Full-rigged_ship": "A full-rigged ship or fully rigged ship is a sailing vessel 's sail plan with three or more masts , all of them square-rigged . A full-rigged ship is said to have a ship rig or be ship-rigged . Sometimes such a vessel will merely be called a ship in 18th- to early-19th-century and earlier usage , to distinguish it from other large three-masted blue-water working vessels such as barques , barquentines , fluyts etc . This full or ship-rig sail plan thus is a term of art [ clarification needed ] that differentiates such vessels as well from other working or cargo vessels with widely diverse alternative sail-plans such as galleons , cogs , sloops , caravels , schooners , brigs and carracks ; some of which also have three masted variants ( brigs , schooners , sloops , and galleons ) . The ship-rig sail plan also differs drastically from the large panoply of one and two masted vessels found as working and recreational sailboats . Alternatively , a full-rigged ship may be referred to by its function instead , as in collier or frigate , rather than being called a ship . In many languages the word frigate or frigate rig refers to a full-rigged ship .",
