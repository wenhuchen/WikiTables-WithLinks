As a young man in Utah Territory , Woolley served as a courier and bodyguard for polygamous leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) in hiding during the federal crusade against polygamy . His career as a religious leader in his own right commenced in the early twentieth century , when he began claiming to have been set apart to keep plural marriage alive by church president John Taylor in connection with the 1886 Revelation . Woolley 's distinctive teachings on authority , morality , and doctrine are thought to provide the theological foundation for nearly ninety percent of Mormon fundamentalist groups .",

  "/wiki/Plural_marriage": "Polygamy ( called plural marriage by Mormons in the 19th century or the Principle by modern fundamentalist practitioners of polygamy ) was practiced by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) for more than half of the 19th century , and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890 by between 20 and 30 percent of Latter-day Saint families . Note that there are various denominations that are considered Mormons and they have different beliefs and practices . [ citation needed ] The Latter-day Saints ' practice of polygamy has been controversial , both within Western society and the LDS Church itself . The U.S. was both fascinated and horrified by the practice of polygamy , with the Republican platform at one time referencing the twin relics of barbarism - polygamy and slavery . The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder Joseph Smith . The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles , Orson Pratt , by the request of church president Brigham Young . For over 60 years , the LDS Church and the United States were at odds over the issue : the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom , while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it , consistent with prevailing public opinion . Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the Utah War of 1857 and 1858 , given Republican attempts to paint Democratic President James Buchanan as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery . In 1862 , the United States Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act , which prohibited plural marriage in the territories . In spite of the law , Mormons continued to practice polygamy , believing that it was protected by the First Amendment . In 1879 , in Reynolds v. United States , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Morrill Act , stating : Laws are made for the government of actions , and while they can not interfere with mere religious belief and opinion , they may with practices . In 1890 , when it became clear that Utah would not be admitted to the Union while polygamy was still the practice , church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially terminated the practice of polygamy .",

The AUB has had a temple in Mexico , since at least the 1990s , an endowment house in Utah since the early 1980s and several other locations of worship to accommodate their members in Wyoming , Idaho , and Montana . The title Apostolic United Brethren is not generally used by members , who prefer to call it The Work , The Priesthood , or The Group . Those outside the faith sometimes refer to it as the Allred Group because two of its presidents shared that surname . Members of the AUB do not refer to their organization as a church and , unlike nearly all other Mormon fundamentalist groups , regard The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) as a legitimate , if wayward and diminished , divine institution . Religious scholar J. Gordon Melton characterised the group as the more liberal branch of the Fundamentalist movement , as the group allows sexual relations apart from the strict purpose of procreation . The group came into the Hollywood spotlight with the release of the hit reality TV series Sister Wives aired in 2010 . The AUB furnished a detailed description of their beliefs and practices in August 2009 to the Utah Attorney General 's Polygamy Primer , which was later revised in 2011 .

  "/wiki/Priesthood_(Latter_Day_Saints)": "In the Latter Day Saint movement , priesthood is the power and authority of God given to man , including the authority to perform ordinances and to act as a leader in the church . A body of priesthood holders is referred to as a quorum . Priesthood denotes elements of both power and authority . The priesthood includes the power Jesus gave his apostles to perform miracles such as the casting out of devils and the healing of sick ( Luke 9:1 ) . Latter Day Saints believe that the Biblical miracles performed by prophets and apostles were performed by the power of priesthood , including the miracles of Jesus , who holds all of the keys of the priesthood . The priesthood is formally known as the Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God , but to avoid the too frequent use of the name of deity , the priesthood is referred to as the Melchizedek priesthood ( Melchizedek being the high priest to whom Abraham paid tithes ) . As an authority , priesthood is the authority by which a bearer may perform ecclesiastical acts of service in the name of God . Latter Day Saints believe that acts ( and in particular , ordinances ) performed by one with priesthood authority are recognized by God and are binding in heaven , on earth , and in the afterlife . In addition , Latter Day Saints believe that leadership positions within the church are legitimized by the priesthood authority . For most of the history of the Latter Day Saint movement , only men have been ordained to specific offices in the priesthood . The first exception to this policy was within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( Strangite ) , a faction founded by James J. Strang that flourished between 1844 and 1856 ( though a diminutive remnant still exists today ) . In Strang 's church , women were - and still are - permitted to hold the offices of priest and teacher ( but not any other offices ) from as early as 1856 .",

  "/wiki/Council_of_Fifty": "The Council of Fifty ( also known as the Living Constitution , the Kingdom of God , or its name by revelation , The Kingdom of God and His Laws with the Keys and Power thereof , and Judgment in the Hands of His Servants , Ahman Christ ) was a Latter Day Saint organization established by Joseph Smith in 1844 to symbolize and represent a future theocratic or theodemocratic Kingdom of God on the earth . Smith prophetically claimed that this Kingdom would be established in preparation for the Millennium and the Second Coming of Jesus . The political Kingdom of God , organized around the Council of Fifty , was meant to be a force of peace and order in the midst of this chaos . According to latter-day saint teachings , while Jesus himself would be king of this new world government , its structure was in fact to be quasi-republican and multi-denominational ; therefore , the early Council of Fifty included both Mormons and non-Mormons . Although the Council played a significant role during the last few months of Joseph Smith 's life , particularly in his campaign for President of the United States , the Council 's role was mostly symbolic throughout the 19th century within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . This was largely because the Council was primarily meant for a time when secular governments had ceased to function .

  "/wiki/Spencer_W._Kimball": "Spencer Woolley Kimball ( March 28 , 1895 - November 5 , 1985 ) was an American business , civic , and religious leader , and was the twelfth president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) . The grandson of early Latter-day Saint apostle Heber C. Kimball , Kimball was born in Salt Lake City , Utah Territory . He spent most of his early life in Thatcher , Arizona , where his father , Andrew Kimball , farmed and served as the area 's stake president . He served an LDS mission from 1914 to 1916 , then worked for various banks in Arizona 's Gila Valley as a clerk and bank teller . Kimball later co-founded a business , selling bonds and insurance that , after weathering the Great Depression , became highly successful . Kimball served as a stake president in his hometown from 1938 until 1943 , when he was called to serve as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles . Like most other LDS Church apostles , Kimball traveled extensively to fulfill a wide variety of administrative and ecclesiastical duties . Early in his time as an apostle , Kimball was directed by church president George Albert Smith to spend extra time in religious and humanitarian work with Native Americans , which Kimball did throughout his life . He initiated the Indian Placement Program , which helped many Native American students gain education in the 1960s and 1970s while they stayed with LDS foster families . In late 1973 , following the sudden death of church president Harold B. Lee , Kimball became the twelfth president of the LDS Church , a position he held until his death in 1985 . Kimball 's presidency was noted for the 1978 announcement ending the restriction on church members of black African descent being ordained to the priesthood or receiving temple ordinances . Kimball 's presidency saw large growth in the LDS Church , both in terms of membership and the number of temples .",

The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) .

  "/wiki/Excommunicated": "Excommunication is an institutional act of religious censure used to end or at least regulate the communion of a member of a congregation with other members of the religious institution who are in normal communion with each other . The purpose of the institutional act is to deprive , suspend , or limit membership in a religious community or to restrict certain rights within it , in particular , those of being in communion with other members of the congregation , and of receiving the sacraments . The term is often historically used to refer specifically to excommunications from the Catholic Church , but it is also used more generally to refer to similar types of institutional religious exclusionary practices and shunning among other religious groups . For instance , many Protestant denominations , such as the Lutheran Churches , have similar practices of excusing congregants from church communities , while Jehovah 's Witnesses , as well as the Churches of Christ , use the term disfellowship to refer to their form of excommunication . The Amish have also been known to excommunicate members that were either seen or known for breaking rules , or questioning the church . The word excommunication means putting a specific individual or group out of communion . In some denominations , excommunication includes spiritual condemnation of the member or group . Excommunication may involve banishment , shunning , and shaming , depending on the group , the offense that caused excommunication , or the rules or norms of the religious community . The grave act is often revoked in response to sincere penance , which may be manifested through public recantation , sometimes through the Sacrament of Confession , piety or through mortification of the flesh .",
