  "/wiki/Bortle_Dark_Sky_Scale": "The Bortle scale is a nine-level numeric scale that measures the night sky 's brightness of a particular location . It quantifies the astronomical observability of celestial objects and the interference caused by light pollution . John E. Bortle created the scale and published it in the February 2001 edition of Sky & Telescope magazine to help amateur astronomers evaluate the darkness of an observing site , and secondarily , to compare the darkness of observing sites . The scale ranges from Class 1 , the darkest skies available on Earth , through Class 9 , inner-city skies . It gives several criteria for each level beyond naked-eye limiting magnitude ( NELM ) . The accuracy and utility of the scale have been questioned in recent research . The table below summarizes Bortle 's descriptions of the classes . Some classes can have very drastic differences from the one next to it , e.g , Bortle 4 - 5 .",
  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
