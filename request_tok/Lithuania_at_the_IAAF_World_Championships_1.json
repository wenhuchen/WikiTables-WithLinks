After 1946 , its territory and borders mirrored those of today 's Republic of Lithuania , with the exception of minor adjustments of the border with Belarus . During World War II , the previously independent Republic of Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet army on 16 June 1940 , in conformity with the terms of the 23 August 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , and established as a puppet state on 21 July . Between 1941 and 1944 , the German invasion of the Soviet Union caused its de facto dissolution . However , with the retreat of the Germans in 1944-1945 , Soviet hegemony was re-established and continued for forty-five years . As a result , many western countries continued to recognize Lithuania as an independent , sovereign de jure state subject to international law , represented by the legations appointed by the pre-1940 Baltic states , which functioned in various places through the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service . On 18 May 1989 , the Lithuanian SSR declared itself to be a sovereign state , though still part of the USSR . On 11 March 1990 , the Republic of Lithuania was re-established as an independent state . Considered illegal by the Soviet authorities , the country was recognized by western powers immediately prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union itself recognized Lithuanian independence on 6 September 1991 .",

  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis ) .",
