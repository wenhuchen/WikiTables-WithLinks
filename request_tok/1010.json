  "/wiki/Popular_Democratic_Party_of_Puerto_Rico": "The Popular Democratic Party ( Spanish : Partido Popular Democr\u00e1tico , PPD ) is a political party in Puerto Rico that advocates to continue as a Commonwealth of the United States with self-government . [ a ] [ b ] The party was founded in 1938 by dissidents from the Puerto Rican Liberal Party and the Unionist Party and originally promoted policies on the center-left . [ c ] In recent years , however , its leaders have described the party as centrist . [ d ] [ e ] As one of the long-standing parties on the island , the PPD has played a significant role in the history of Puerto Rico . In the early 1950s , for example , the party held a majority in the delegation convened to draft the Constitution of Puerto Rico . Once the constitution was ratified , the document was proclaimed by the party 's leader and co-founder , Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn - who , in doing so , became the first Puerto Rican governor elected by the people of Puerto Rico . The party ruled all branches of the Puerto Rican government afterward for 36 of the past 68 years , while establishing many of the institutions that permeate Puerto Rican society today . Today , the party is one of the two major parties in Puerto Rico with significant political strength . In the executive branch , the party 's last governor was Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla who governed the island from 2013-2017 . It also holds minorities in the legislative and judicial branches by holding minorities in the Senate , in the House , and in the Supreme Court . The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , however , is from the PPD ; a circumstance that allows the party to designate political appointees in the judicial branch since the Chief Justice is also constitutionally the chief judicial administrator . Finally , in the municipal landscape , the party holds more than half of the seats of mayors .",

  "/wiki/New_Progressive_Party_of_Puerto_Rico": "The New Progressive Party ( Spanish : Partido Nuevo Progresista , PNP ) is a political party in Puerto Rico that advocates statehood . The PNP is one of the two major parties in Puerto Rico with significant political strength and currently holds both the seat of the governor and of the resident commissioner . In legislative matters , the party has a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives ; a majority that gives the party full control over all legislations , including constitutional amendments , without political opposition . These majorities over the legislative branch , the control over the governorship seat , and a majority of Supreme Court justices affiliated with the party give the PNP absolute control over all three branches of government without political opposition . The party , however , has a minority in the number of mayors on the island . Domestically , the party is primarily contrasted by two other political parties : the Popular Democratic Party ( PPD ) , which advocates maintaining the current political status of Puerto Rico as that of an unincorporated territory of the United States with self-government , and the smaller Puerto Rican Independence Party ( PIP ) , which advocates for the independence of Puerto Rico . [ a ] [ b ] In national/mainland politics , members are split , with some party members affiliating with the Republican Party and some with the Democratic Party . The party traces its history back to 1967 . In that year , the Partido Estadista Republicano instructed its members to not participate in a referendum held that year . Unhappy with the mandate , several dissidents left the Statehood Party and founded the PNP afterwards .",
