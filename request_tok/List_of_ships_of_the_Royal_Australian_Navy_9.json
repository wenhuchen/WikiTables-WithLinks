  "/wiki/HMAS_Hankow": "HMAS Hankow was a coal hulk of the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) between 1913 until 1932 . Built in 1869 by Alexander Stephen and Sons , Linthouse as the composite fully rigged ship City of Hankow , for George Smith & Sons . Sold to G. J. Robertson , Sydney in 1900 . She was bought by the RAN in July 1913 and commissioned as HMAS Hankow for use as a coal hulk at the Garden Island Naval Base . She was towed to Thursday Island in 1923 as a hulk for the Thursday Island Coaling Station . Returned to Sydney on 11 November 1927 for refit and returned to Thursday Island on 18 January 1929 . Hankow was towed to Darwin , Northern Territory in August 1932 and was used as a target outside Darwin Harbour and sunk by gunfire from HMAS Albatross on 18 September .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Albatross_(1928)": "HMAS Albatross ( later HMS Albatross ) was a seaplane tender of the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , which was later transferred to the Royal Navy and used as a repair ship . Albatross was built by Cockatoo Island Dockyard during the mid-1920s and entered service at the start of 1929 . The ship experienced problems with the aircraft assigned to her during her career : the amphibious aircraft she had been designed for were retired just before the ship entered service , the replacement aircraft could not be catapult-launched from the ship , and a new plane designed specifically to work with the ship began operations after Albatross was demoted from seagoing status in 1933 . After five years in reserve , Albatross was transferred to the Royal Navy to offset the Australian purchase of the light cruiser Hobart . Although the British had little use for a seaplane carrier , the ship found a niche after two aircraft carriers were sunk by the Germans early in World War II . Albatross was initially based in Freetown , Sierra Leone for patrol and convoy escort duties in the southern Atlantic , then was relocated to the Indian Ocean in mid-1942 . From late 1943 to early 1944 , the vessel underwent conversion into a Landing Ship ( Engineering ) to support the Normandy landings , and was used to repair landing craft and other support vessels off Sword and Juno Beaches . Albatross was torpedoed in October , but survived to be towed back to England and repaired . After repairs completed at the start of 1945 , she served as a minesweeper depot ship , but was decommissioned after the war 's end . Albatross was sold into civilian service in August 1946 , and after several changes of hands was renamed Hellenic Prince in 1948 and converted into a passenger liner . The vessel was chartered by the International Refugee Organisation to transport refugees from Europe to Australia . Hellenic Prince saw service as a troopship during the 1953 Mau Mau uprising , but was broken up for scrap a year later .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Vigilant": "HMAS Vigilant ( later known as HMAS Sleuth and HMAS Hawk ) was an auxiliary patrol boat serving with the Royal Australian Navy during the Second World War . Notably it was the 120th ship built by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the first aluminium ship built in Australia .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Hawk_(1961)": "HMAS Hawk ( M 1139 ) ( formerly HMS Somerlyton ) was a Ton-class minesweeper operated by the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . The minesweeper was built for the Royal Navy as HMS Gamston , but renamed HMS Somerlyton before entering service . She was sold to Australia in 1961 , and commissioned as HMAS Hawk in 1962 . The ship operated through the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation , and was decommissioned in 1972 .",
  "/wiki/Ton-class_minesweeper": "The Ton class were coastal minesweepers built in the 1950s for the Royal Navy , but also used by other navies such as the South African Navy and the Royal Australian Navy . They were intended to meet the threat of seabed mines laid in shallow coastal waters , rivers , ports and harbours , a task for which the existing ocean-going minesweepers of the Algerine-class were not suited .",

  "/wiki/River-class_frigate": "The River class was a class of 151 frigates launched between 1941 and 1944 for use as anti-submarine convoy escorts in the North Atlantic . The majority served with the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) , with some serving in the other Allied navies : the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , the Free French Navy ( FFN ) , the Royal Netherlands Navy and , post-war , the South African Navy ( SAN ) . The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 , and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom , giving name to the class . In Canada , they were named for towns and cities , though they kept the same designation . Originally called a twin-screw corvette , the name frigate was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy . Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941 . The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal . In all , Canada ordered the construction of 70 frigates , including ten for the Royal Navy , which transferred two to the United States Navy . Twelve were built in Australia for the RAN ( four to a modified design ) . After World War II , they found employment in many other navies the world over ; several RCN ships were sunk as breakwaters . One , HMCS Stormont , was purchased by Aristotle Onassis and converted into the luxury yacht Christina O .",

Twenty three destroyers were built for the United States Navy , three for the Royal Australian Navy , and three for the West German Bundesmarine . The design of these ships was based on that of Forrest Sherman-class destroyers , but the Charles F. Adams class were the first class designed to serve as guided missile destroyers . [ Note 1 ] 19 feet ( 5.8 m ) of length was added to the center of the design of the Forrest Sherman class to carry the ASROC launcher . The Charles F. Adams-class destroyers were the last steam turbine-powered destroyers built for the U.S. Navy .

  "/wiki/HMAS_Horsham": "HMAS Horsham ( J235/M235 ) , named for the city of Horsham , Victoria , was one of 60 Bathurst-class corvettes constructed during World War II , and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) .",
  "/wiki/Bathurst-class_corvette": "The Bathurst-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels produced in Australia during World War II . Originally classified as minesweepers , but widely referred to as corvettes , the Bathurst-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine , anti-mine , and convoy escort role . Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system .

Originally to be named after the River Derwent , the ship was renamed before her 1914 launch because of a naming conflict with a Royal Navy vessel . Huon was commissioned into the RAN in late 1915 , and after completion was deployed to the Far East . In mid-1917 , Huon and her five sister ships were transferred to the Mediterranean . Huon served as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship until a collision with sister ship HMAS Yarra in August 1918 saw Huon drydocked for the rest of World War I . After a refit in England , Huon returned to Australia in 1919 . The destroyer spent several periods alternating between commissioned and reserve status over the next nine years , with the last three spent as a reservist training ship . Huon was decommissioned for the final time in 1928 , and was scuttled in 1931 after being used as a target ship .",
  "/wiki/River-class_torpedo-boat_destroyer": "The River class was a class of six torpedo-boat destroyers operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . The design was based on a modified version of the British River-class destroyer , 13 of which were planned under the 1904 Naval Estimates , but were cancelled before orders were placed . The first batch of three ships was ordered for the Commonwealth Naval Forces in 1909 , followed later by a second batch of three a few years later . All six vessels are named after Australian rivers . The Rivers saw service during World War I . Ships of the class participated in the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force capture of German New Guinea , and performed patrols in Australian and Malayan waters . In 1917 , the class was deployed as a single unit to the Mediterranean , and assigned to anti-submarine patrols of the Adriatic . The destroyers returned to Australia in 1919 , and were placed in reserve . All six ships of the class were disposed of by the 1930s . Three were sold for use as accommodation hulks ( two to the NSW Penal Department , the third to Cockatoo Island Dockyard ) and later sank . The other three were sunk as target ships . The bow and stern sections of HMAS Parramatta were recovered in 1973 and are preserved as memorials ."
