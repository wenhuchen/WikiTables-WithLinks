  "/wiki/River_Darent": "The Darent is a Kentish tributary of the River Thames and takes the waters of the River Cray as a tributary in the tidal portion of the Darent near Crayford , as illustrated by the adjacent photograph , snapped at high tide . 'Darenth ' is frequently found in the spelling of the river 's name in older books and maps , Bartholomew 's Canal 's and River of England being one example . Bartholomew 's Gazetteer ( 1954 ) demonstrates that Darent means clear water and separately explains the other name . Considering the River Darent runs on a bed of chalk and its springs rise through chalk , this is not surprising . The original purity of the water was a major reason for the development of paper and pharmaceuticals in the area . Darenth Parish ( through which the river flows ) derives from a Celtic phrase 'stream where oak-trees grow ' ( Irish : dair = 'oak-tree ' , abha = river ) ( compare e.g.Derwent ) . The landscapes of the valley were painted in a visionary manner by the renowned Victorian artist Samuel Palmer during the mid 1800s . Fed by springs from the greensand hills south of Westerham in Kent and below Limpsfield Chart in Surrey it flows 21 miles ( 34 km ) east then north by Otford and Shoreham , past the castle and the ruined Roman villa at Lullingstone , then by Eynsford , Farningham , Horton Kirby , South Darenth , Sutton-at-Hone , Darenth , and eventually to Dartford whence it proceeds a final two miles as a tidal estuary until it drops into the Thames Long Reach . North of Dartford the Darent is tidal and , just before entering the Thames , receives the waters of the River Cray at Dartford & Crayford Marshes where the rivers form administrative boundaries between Greater London and Kent , ( specifically , the London Borough of Bexley and the Kentish borough of Dartford ) . The Darent enters Thames Long Reach to the East of Crayford Ness . Kent County Council has signposted a 19-mile ( 31 km ) walking route along the Darent between the Greensand Hills above Sevenoaks and the Thames and named it The Darent Valley Path . The route receives no obvious attention from councils or 'focus ' groups [ citation needed ] although all or part is used by joggers , cyclists , walkers , dog walkers and curious adventurers , availing themselves of the Darent Valley Path to access or view the river 's amenities , such as they are .",

  "/wiki/River_Lea": "The River Lea is a river in South East England . It originates in the Chiltern Hills , England , and flows southeast through east London where it meets the River Thames , the last looping section being known as Bow Creek . It is one of the largest rivers in London and the easternmost major tributary of the Thames . Its valley creates a long chain of marshy ground along its lower length , much of which has been used for gravel and mineral extraction , reservoirs and industry . Much of the river has been canalised to provide a navigable route for boats into eastern Hertfordshire , known as the Lee Navigation . While the lower Lea remains somewhat polluted , its upper stretch and tributaries , classified as chalk streams , are a major source of drinking water for London . A diversion known as the New River , opened in 1613 , abstracts clean water away from the lower stretch of the river for drinking . Its origins in the Chilterns contribute to the extreme hardness ( high mineral content ) of London tap water .",

It is named after a ford of the River Ravensbourne . From the mid 16th century to the late 19th it was home to Deptford Dockyard , the first of the Royal Dockyards . This was a major shipbuilding dock and attracted Peter the Great to come and study shipbuilding . Deptford and the docks are associated with the knighting of Sir Francis Drake by Queen Elizabeth I aboard the Golden Hind , the legend of Sir Walter Raleigh laying down his cape for Elizabeth , Captain James Cook 's third voyage aboard Resolution , and the mysterious murder of Christopher Marlowe in a house along Deptford Strand . Though Deptford began as two small communities , one at the ford , and the other a fishing village on the Thames , Deptford 's history and population has been mainly associated with the docks established by Henry VIII . The two communities grew together and flourished ; the docks were the main administrative centre of the Royal Navy , and some grand houses like Sayes Court , home to diarist John Evelyn , and Stone House on Lewisham Way , were erected . The area declined as first the Royal Navy moved out , and then the commercial docks themselves declined until the last dock , Convoys Wharf , closed in 2000 .

Centred 1 1\u20442 miles ( 2.4 km ) east of Charing Cross , it fronts the River Thames and the City of London to the north . It was at the lowest bridging point of the Thames in Roman Britain , providing a crossing from Londinium , and for centuries had the only Thames bridge in the area , until a bridge was built upstream more than 10 miles ( 16 km ) to the west . [ n 1 ] It was a 1295-enfranchised ( nationally represented ) borough in the county of Surrey , apparently created a burh in 886 , containing various parishes by the high medieval period , lightly succumbing to City attempts to constrain its free trade and entertainment . Its entertainment district , in its heyday at the time of Shakespare 's Globe Theatre ( which stood 1599-1642 ) has revived in the form of the Southbank which overspills imperceptibly into the ancient boundaries of Lambeth and commences at the post-1997 reinvention of the original theatre , Shakespeare 's Globe , incorporating other smaller theatre spaces , an exhibition about Shakespeare 's life and work and which neighbours Vinopolis and the London Dungeon . After the 18th-century decline of Southwark 's small wharves , the borough rapidly grew in population and saw the growth of great docks , printing/paper , railways , goods yards , small artisan and other often low-wage industries and Southwark was among many such inner districts to see slum clearance and replacement largely with social housing during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . It is now at an advanced stage of regeneration and has the City Hall offices of the Greater London Authority . At its heart is the area known as Borough , which has an eclectic covered and semi-covered market and numerous food and drink venues as well as the skyscraper The Shard .

  "/wiki/City_of_London": "The City of London is a city , county and a local government district [ note 1 ] that contains the historic centre and the primary central business district ( CBD ) of London . It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages , but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City 's borders . The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London , though it remains a notable part of central London . Administratively , it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London ; however , the City of London is not a London borough , a status reserved for the other 32 districts ( including London 's only other city , the City of Westminster ) . It is also a separate ceremonial county , being an enclave surrounded by Greater London , and is the smallest county in the United Kingdom . The City of London is widely referred to simply as the City ( differentiated from the phrase the city of London by capitalising City ) and is also colloquially known as the Square Mile , as it is 1.12 sq mi ( 716.80 acres ; 2.90 km2 ) in area . Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom 's trading and financial services industries , which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City . The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City . London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis , or the 32 London boroughs , in addition to the City of London itself . This wider usage of London is documented as far back as 1888 , when the County of London was created . The local authority for the City , namely the City of London Corporation , is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council , such as being the police authority .

  "/wiki/Blackfriars,_London": "Blackfriars is an area of central London , which lies in the south-west corner of the City of London . The name Blackfriars was first used in 1317 ( as Black Freres from the French 'fr\u00e8re ' meaning 'brother ' ) and derives from the black cappa worn by the Dominican Friars who moved their priory from Holborn to the area between the River Thames and Ludgate Hill in about 1276 . Edward I gave permission to rebuild London 's city wall , which lay between the river and Ludgate Hill , around their area . The site was used for great occasions of state , including meetings of Parliament and the Privy Council , state visits , such as of Emperor Charles V in 1522 , as well as the location for a divorce hearing in 1529 of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII . The priory was eventually closed in 1538 during Henry 's dissolution of the monasteries . Katherine Parr , Henry VIII 's sixth and final wife , was born in the area . Some of the buildings were subsequently leased to a group of entrepreneurs who created the Blackfriars Theatre on the site , not far from Shakespeare 's Globe Theatre which stood almost directly across on the other side of the river . In 1632 , the Society of Apothecaries ( a livery company ) , acquired the monastery 's guesthouse and established their base there . The building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London but the Society rebuilt and Apothecaries Hall is still to be found in Blackfriars today . The area is now the location of Blackfriars station and forms the northern bridge-head for both Blackfriars Bridge and Blackfriars Railway Bridge . Opposite Blackfriars station the former Spicers Brothers paper company office was restored as Crowne Plaza London - The City hotel in 1916 .

From the Victorian period until the mid-20th century , Vauxhall was a mixed industrial and residential area , of predominantly manual workers ' homes , many demolished and replaced by Lambeth Council with social housing after the Second World War , and business premises , including large railway , gas , and water works . These industries contrasted with the mostly residential neighbouring districts of Kennington and Pimlico . As in neighbouring Battersea and Nine Elms , riverside redevelopment has converted most former industrial sites into residential properties and new office space . Vauxhall has given its name to the Vauxhall parliamentary constituency , Vauxhall Motors , and - most likely apocryphally - the Russian word \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b ( vokzal ) , meaning a large railway station .",

The area has no defined boundaries and straddles five London boroughs and three postal districts , although there is a Crystal Palace electoral ward and Crystal Palace Park in the London Borough of Bromley . It is contiguous with Anerley , Dulwich Wood , Gipsy Hill , Penge , South Norwood , Sydenham and Upper Norwood . The district was a natural oak forest until development began in the 19th century , and before the arrival of the Crystal Palace , it was known as Sydenham Hill . The Norwood Ridge and an historic oak tree were used to mark parish boundaries . The area is represented by three parliamentary constituencies , four London Assembly constituencies and fourteen local councillors . After the Crystal Palace burned down in 1936 , the site of the building and its grounds became Crystal Palace Park , the location of the National Sports Centre which contains an athletics track , stadium and other sports facilities . Crystal Palace Park has also been used as the setting for a number of concerts and films , such as The Italian Job and The Pleasure Garden and contains the Crystal Palace Park Concert Platform , in place since 1997 . Two television transmitter masts make the district a landmark location , visible from many parts of Greater London . Local landmarks include the Crystal Palace Triangle , a shopping district made up of three streets forming a triangle ; Westow Park , a smaller park that lies off the triangle to the south west of Crystal Palace Park ; and the Stambourne Woodland Walk .

  "/wiki/Tyburn_(stream)": "The River Tyburn was a stream ( bourn ) in London , its main successor sewers emulate its main courses but it resembled the Colne in its county of Middlesex in that it had many distributaries ( inland mouths ) . It ran from South Hampstead , through Marylebone and Soho ( St Anne 's , Westminster ) then ran through St James 's parish/district and Green Park to meet the tidal Thames at four sites , grouped into pairs . These pairs were near Whitehall Stairs ( east of Downing Street ) and by Thorney Street , between Millbank Tower and Thames House . Its much smaller cousin the Tyburn Brook was a tributary of the Westbourne , in turn the next Thames tributary ( west , on the north bank ) .
