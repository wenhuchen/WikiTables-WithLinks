Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales . He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there . There has been human settlement in the Odense area for over 4,000 years , although the name was not mentioned in writing until 988 , and by 1070 , it had already grown into a thriving city . Canute IV of Denmark , generally considered to be the last Viking king , was murdered by unruly peasants in Odense 's St Alban 's Priory on 10 July 1086 . Although the city was burned in 1249 following a royal rivalry , it quickly recovered and flourished as a centre of commerce in the Middle Ages . After a period of decline , large-scale plans for development were made during the 18th century , which led to the rebuilding of Odense Palace and the building of a canal to the Port of Odense , facilitating trade . In 1865 , one of the largest railway terminals in Denmark was built , further increasing the population and commerce , and by 1900 , Odense had reached a population of 35,000 . Odense 's Odinst\u00e5rnet was one of the tallest towers in Europe when built in 1935 but was destroyed by the Nazis during World War II .",

The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road . Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion . After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture .",
