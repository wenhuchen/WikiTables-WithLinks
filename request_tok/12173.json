It took place in Frankfurt-am-Main , West Germany and was held at the Gro\u00dfer Sendesaal des hessischen Rundfunks on Sunday 3 March 1957 . The show was hosted by German actress Anaid Iplicjian . Like the first edition of the contest , this one was still mainly a radio programme , but there was a noticeable increase in the number of people with televisions . The winner was the Netherlands with the song Net als toen , performed by Corry Brokken , written by Willy van Hemert and composed by Guus Jansen . This was the Netherlands ' first victory in the contest . For some time , a rumour had existed that the privilege of hosting the 1957 contest was given to Germany because they had come in second place in 1956 with Im Wartesaal zum gro\u00dfen Gl\u00fcck by Walter Andreas Schwarz . In fact , not only were the official 1956 scores withheld , but the rule stating that the winning nation hosts the next year 's Eurovision Song Contest had not yet been conceived . It was planned at the time that each participating country would take it in turns to host the event . However , as more countries wished to participate , this became impractical .",

At the close of voting , it had received 10 points , placing 3rd in a field of 10 . The song is a love duet , with the singers parting before one of them takes a sea voyage on the ship of the title . Additionally , the song is famous for the kiss the duo exchanged at the end of the performance - the longest stage kiss in Contest history , made so by a stagehand omitting to signal for it to end . While the Contest was still predominantly a radio show at the time , the conservative social mores ensured that this event has entered Eurovision folklore . Indeed , at the late 2005 Congratulations special , hosts Katrina Leskanich and Renars Kaupers pretended to re-enact it , only to have Wilke herself appear between them .

She manifested her fluency in four languages by switching between a strong transatlantic English , French , German and Luxembourgish in the course of talking , often in the same sentence . Sweden 's the Herreys were the winners of this contest with the song , Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley . This was the Nordic country 's second win , and the first one in Swedish , as ABBA performed Waterloo in English when they won in 1974 . Richard and Luis Herrey became the first teenage males to win Eurovision and remain the youngest ever male winners , being 19 years and 260 days and 18 years and 184 days of age respectively . Israel withdrew from the contest due to Yom Hazikaron ( Day of Remembrance for the Fallen Soldiers of Israel and Victims of Terrorism ) being commemorated on the same date . Iceland was going to participate but withdrew due to lack of financial support . 1984 is also a notable for the audible booing that could be heard from the audience , particularly at the end of the UK 's performance . It was said that the booing was due to English football hooligans having rioted in Luxembourg in November 1983 after being knocked out of the UEFA European Football Championship .

She tells him that his presence brightens the day considerably and that he should n't be afraid of loving her , as he appears to be . As part of their performance of this song in the Danish national selection , the female half of the duo ( Kirsten Siggard ) , pushed the male half ( S\u00f8ren Bundgaard ) into a swimming pool .

Kirsten was brought up in a traditional Christian family who sang in a church choir when she was young and later pursued a career deemed appropriate and desirable , working in a bank , where she met her husband , Jorgen .

Both Sir Henry and Kirsten entered the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix , which serves as the Danish pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest ( ESC ) , in 1983 . For some reason , Sir Henry 's entry , Og Livet g\u00e5r with music composed by S\u00f8ren and Leif Pedersen was disqualified and Kirsten took their place in the final , but in a somewhat consolation-prize style they sang as backing vocals for Kirsten . S\u00f8ren later decided to leave Sir Henry in favor of further cooperation with Kirsten , and the duo entered the Dansk MGP in 1984 as Hot Eyes with the song Det ' lige det with music by S\u00f8ren and lyrics by Keld Heick ( who also penned lyrics to all other Hot Eyes ' Dansk MGP entries ) . The song became known in Denmark as the swimming pool song , as at the end of the Dansk MGP performance Kirsten threw S\u00f8ren into a swimming pool by the stage .

Over the course of the song , this person is gradually revealed to be the person to whom the song is being sung in the first place . The performance is perhaps more memorable for the fact that the female half of the duo ( Kirsten Siggard ) was heavily pregnant at the time and would give birth only three weeks after the contest .

It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1990 Contest by Lonnie Devantier with Hallo Hallo , with lyrics also by Keld Heick . The song qualified as the Danish entry into the Eurovision Song Contest by the usual means of winning that year 's Dansk Melodi Grand Prix . All of the contributors were Dansk Melodi Grand Prix regulars - although for Birthe it was the first , and only , time to win after three unsuccessful attempts , Keld Heick had by then authored lyrics to five winning songs , and S\u00f8ren Bundgaard wrote music and co-performed three of them , although with another female vocalist , Kirsten Siggaard , as part of the duo Hot Eyes .

Vi maler byen r\u00f8d is an evocation of good times , with Kj\u00e6r describing the fun that can be had by painting the town red . Musically , it is something of a throwback to an earlier time as well , sounding like a more unabashed vocal performance than the more modern numbers starting to achieve success at the Contest at the time .

By the close of voting , it had received 92 points , placing it 5th in a field of 23 . The song is a love ballad , with Wilken singing about her desire to be with her lover - she asks him , for example , to let her know train times so that she can be with him . The title of the song comes from her description of the breadth of her feelings about him : From Mols to Skagen I 'm missing you . Mols is the name of a district in east Mid Jutland , while Skagen is Denmark 's northernmost town ( in North Jutland ) , so the two locations are not in fact vastly far apart ( about 170 km as the crow flies ) . Musically , the song is a comparatively slow one , in contrast to the increasingly up-tempo style of other contest entries . It was chosen as the winner of a preliminary Danish song contest by a jury of music professionals ( instead of the usual way of letting viewers decide by telephone voting ) . Initially the song did not enjoy much popularity among the general public , but that seemed to change after its relatively high placing in the international contest . Despite the successful placement of the song , Denmark did not participate in the 1996 contest , as the qualification rules had been changed to require all competing countries barring the host nation to qualify - something the Danes were unable to accomplish . The performance was , however , enough to qualify Denmark as one of the entrants in the next Contest .
