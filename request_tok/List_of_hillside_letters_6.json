  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

Bathurst is the oldest inland settlement in Australia and had a population of 36,801 at June 2018 . Bathurst is often referred to as the Gold Country as it was the site of the first gold discovery and where the first gold rush occurred in Australia . Bathurst is the second oldest inland city behind Goulburn as stated by historian Oscar Cunningham . Today education , tourism and manufacturing drive the economy . The internationally known racetrack Mount Panorama is a landmark of the city . Bathurst has a historic city centre with many ornate buildings remaining from the gold rush period of the mid to late 19th century . The median age of the city 's population is 35 years ; which is particularly young for a regional centre ( the state median is 38 ) , and is related to the large education sector in the community . Population growth has reached 1.6% per annum over the five years until 2010 , making Bathurst the seventh fastest growing regional city in New South Wales . This growth over recent years has resulted in increased urban development including retail precincts , sporting facilities , housing estates and expanding industrial areas .",
  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Panorama_Circuit": "Mount Panorama Circuit is a motor racing track located in Bathurst , New South Wales , Australia . It is situated on a hill with the dual official names of Mount Panorama and Wahluu and is best known as the home of the Bathurst 1000 motor race held each October , and the Bathurst 12 Hour event held each February . The track is 6.213 km ( 3.861 mi ) in length , and is technically a street circuit , as it is a public road when no racing events are being run , and there are many residences which can only be accessed from the circuit . The track has an unusual design by modern standards , with a 174-metre ( 571 ft ) vertical difference between its highest and lowest points , and grades as steep as 1:6.13 . From the start-finish line , the track can be viewed in three sections ; the short pit straight and then a tight left turn into the long , steep Mountain straight ; the tight , narrow section across the top of the mountain itself ; and then the long , downhill section of Conrod Straight , with the very fast Chase and the turn back onto pit straight to complete the lap . Historically , the racetrack has been used for a wide variety of racing categories , including everything from open-wheel racers to motorcycles . However , the factors that make the track so unusual , and tighter modern safety standards , make it unlikely that major race meetings for vehicles other than closed-bodied cars will be held there again . As a public road , on non-race days and when it is not closed off during the day as part of a racing event , Mount Panorama is open to the public . Cars can drive in both directions around the circuit for no charge . However , a strict speed limit of 60 km/h ( 37 mph ) is enforced , and police regularly patrol the circuit . The National Motor Racing Museum is located next to the Mount Panorama Circuit .",

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England .

Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed . North Korea officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state , and formally holds elections , though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections . Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship , particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty .
