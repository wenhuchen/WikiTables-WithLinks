  "/wiki/Chicago_Road": "US Highway 12 ( US 12 ) is an east-west US Highway that runs from Aberdeen , Washington , to Detroit , Michigan . In Michigan it runs for 210 miles ( 338 km ) between New Buffalo and Detroit as a state trunkline highway and Pure Michigan Byway . On its western end , the highway is mostly a two-lane road that runs through the southern tier of counties roughly parallel to the Indiana state line . It forms part of the Niles Bypass , a four-lane expressway south of Niles in the southwestern part of the state , and it runs concurrently with the Interstate 94 ( I-94 ) freeway around the south side of Ypsilanti in the southeastern . In between Coldwater and the Ann Arbor area , the highway angles northeasterly and passes the Michigan International Speedway . East of Ypsilanti , US 12 follows a divided highway routing on Michigan Avenue into Detroit , where it terminates at an intersection with Cass Avenue . When US 12 was designated in Michigan on November 11 , 1926 , along with the other original US Highways , it ran along a more northerly course . It originally replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 along Michigan Avenue in the state , the route of the much older St. Joseph Trail , a footpath used by Native Americans before European settlement in the area . It entered from Indiana as it does now , but it followed the Lake Michigan shoreline farther north to Benton Harbor-St. Joseph before turning eastward to run through Kalamazoo , Battle Creek and Jackson . In the Ann Arbor area , it followed a more northerly path into Detroit before terminating downtown . In the 1940s and 1950s , sections of the highway were converted into expressways and freeways . Starting in 1959 , these freeway segments were renumbered as part of I-94 , and in January 1962 , US 12 was shifted to replace US Highway 112 ( US 112 ) .",
