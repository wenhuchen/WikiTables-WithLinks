  "/wiki/Basildon_Park": "Basildon Park is a country house situated 2 miles ( 3 kilometres ) south of Goring-on-Thames and Streatley in Berkshire , between the villages of Upper Basildon and Lower Basildon . It is owned by the National Trust and is a Grade I listed building . The house was built between 1776 and 1783 for Sir Francis Sykes and designed by John Carr in the Palladian style at a time when Palladianism was giving way to the newly fashionable neoclassicism . Thus , the interiors are in a neoclassical Adamesque style . Never fully completed , the house passed through a succession of owners . In 1910 it was standing empty and in 1914 , it was requisitioned by the British Government as an army convalescent hospital . It was again sold in 1928 and quickly sold again . In 1929 , following a failed attempt to dismantle and rebuild the house in the USA , it was stripped of many of its fixtures and fittings and all but abandoned . During World War II , the house was again requisitioned and served as a barracks , a training ground for tanks , and finally a prisoner of war camp - all activities unsuited to the preservation of an already semi-derelict building . In 1952 , a time when hundreds of British country houses were being demolished , it was said of Basildon Park to say it was derelict , is hardly good enough , no window was left intact and most were repaired with cardboard or plywood . Today , Basildon Park is as notable for its mid-twentieth-century renaissance and restoration , by Lord and Lady Iliffe , as it is for its architecture . In 1978 , the Iliffes gave the house , together with its park and a large endowment for its upkeep , to the National Trust in the hope that The National Trust will protect it and its park for future generations to enjoy .",

  "/wiki/National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty": "The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty , commonly known as the National Trust , is an independent charity and membership organisation for environmental and heritage conservation in England , Wales and Northern Ireland . The trust describes itself as a charity that works to preserve and protect historic places and spaces - for ever , for everyone . The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 . Historically , the Trust acquired land by gift and sometimes by public subscription and appeal , but after World War II the loss of English country houses resulted in many such properties being acquired either by gift from the former owners , or through the National Land Fund , later the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery . Country Houses and Estates still make up a significant part of its holdings , but it is also known for its protection of wild landscapes such as in the Lake District and Peak District , historic urban properties , and nature reserves such as Wicken Fen . In Scotland , there is a separate and independent National Trust for Scotland . The National Trust has a unique special power to prevent its inalienable land being sold off , although this can be over-ridden by Parliamentary procedure . The National Trust has been the beneficiary of many large donations and bequests . It owns over 500 heritage properties , which include many historic houses and gardens , industrial monuments , and social history sites . Most of these are open to the public , usually for a charge . Others are leased to tenants on terms that manage to preserve their character whilst providing for more limited public access .

  "/wiki/Sir_Stanley_Spencer": "Sir Stanley Spencer , CBE RA ( 30 June 1891 - 14 December 1959 ) was an English painter . Shortly after leaving the Slade School of Art , Spencer became well known for his paintings depicting Biblical scenes occurring as if in Cookham , the small village beside the River Thames where he was born and spent much of his life . Spencer referred to Cookham as a village in Heaven and in his biblical scenes , fellow-villagers are shown as their Gospel counterparts . Spencer was skilled at organising multi-figure compositions such as in his large paintings for the Sandham Memorial Chapel and the Shipbuilding on the Clyde series , the former being a First World War memorial while the latter was a commission for the War Artists ' Advisory Committee during the Second World War . As his career progressed Spencer often produced landscapes for commercial necessity and the intensity of his early visionary years diminished somewhat while elements of eccentricity came more to the fore . Although his compositions became more claustrophobic and his use of colour less vivid he maintained an attention to detail in his paintings akin to that of the Pre-Raphaelites . Spencer 's works often express his fervent if unconventional Christian faith . This is especially evident in the scenes that he based in Cookham which show the compassion that he felt for his fellow residents and also his romantic and sexual obsessions . Spencer 's works originally provoked great shock and controversy . Nowadays , they still seem stylistic and experimental , while the nude works depicting his futile relationship with his second wife , Patricia Preece , such as the Leg of mutton nude , foreshadow some of the much later works of Lucian Freud . Spencer 's early work is regarded as a synthesis of French Post-Impressionism , exemplified for instance by Paul Gauguin , plus early Italian painting typified by Giotto . In later life Spencer remained an independent artist and did not join any of the artistic movements of the period , although he did show three works at the Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition in 1912 .",
