It shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest , Kosovo [ a ] to the northeast , North Macedonia to the east , Greece to the south and maritime borders with Greece , Montenegro and Italy to the west . Geographically , the country displays varied climatic , geological , hydrological and morphological conditions , defined in an area of 28,748 km2 ( 11,100 sq mi ) . It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab , Skanderbeg , Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea . Historically , the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians , Thracians , Ancient Greeks , Romans , Byzantines , Venetians and Ottomans . The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century . The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries . Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century , the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe . Between the 18th and 19th centuries , Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance . After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars , the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912 . In the 20th century , the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany . Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation .",

With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",
  "/wiki/Armenia": "The original native Armenian name for the country was \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0584 ( Hayk ) ; however , it is currently rarely used . The contemporary name \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 ( Hayastan ) became popular in the Middle Ages by addition of the Persian suffix -stan ( place ) . [ citation needed ] . However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) . The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription ( 515 BC ) as Armina ( ) . The Ancient Greek terms \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 ( Armen\u00eda ) and \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 ( Arm\u00e9nioi , Armenians ) are first mentioned by Hecataeus of Miletus ( c. 550 BC - c. 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . Some scholars have linked the name Armenia with the Early Bronze Age state of Armani ( Armanum , Armi ) or the Late Bronze Age state of Arme ( Shupria ) . These connections are inconclusive as it is not known what languages were spoken in these kingdoms .",

It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro .

Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces .

It forms part of the Macaronesia ecoregion , along with the Azores , Canary Islands , Madeira , and the Savage Isles . Located 570 kilometres ( 350 mi ) west of the Cape Verde Peninsula off the coast of Northwest Africa , the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres ( 1,500 sq mi ) . The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century , when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands , establishing the first European settlement in the tropics . Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade , the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries , attracting merchants , privateers , and pirates . The end of transatlantic slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration . Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes . Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951 , the islands continued to campaign for independence , which was achieved in 1975 . Since the early 1990s , Cape Verde has been a stable representative democracy , and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa . Lacking natural resources , its developing economy is mostly service-oriented , with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment . Its population of around 540,000 is mostly of mixed European , Moorish , Arab and African heritage , and predominantly Roman Catholic , reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule .

It is located southeast of the French mainland and west of the Italian Peninsula , with the nearest land mass being the Italian island of Sardinia to the immediate south . A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island . The island is an administrative region of France ( with the regional capital being Ajaccio ) , divided in two administrative departments , Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud . The corresponding regional and departmental territorial collectivities , however , merged on 1 January 2018 , forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica . As a single territorial collectivity , Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regional collectivities ; for example , the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers . Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second largest town in Corsica . After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , in 1755 Corsica became a self-proclaimed Italian-speaking Republic , until it was officially ceded by Genoa to Louis XV as part of a pledge for debts and subsequently annexed to France in 1769 . Napoleon Bonaparte was born the same year in Ajaccio , and his ancestral home ( Maison Bonaparte ) is today a significant visitor attraction and museum .
