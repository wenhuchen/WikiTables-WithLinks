  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power , and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character . Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts , Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! This slogan ( without stuttering ) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series ( when Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , in his Brooklynese accent , And Dat 's De End ! ) . He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character . Porky 's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter , for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words ; for example , What 's going on ? might become What 's guh-guh-guh-guh - .what 's happening ? Porky 's age varied widely in the series ; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet ( explicitly mentioned as such in Porky 's Preview ) , Porky was more frequently cast as an adult , often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years . In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons , Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head , and his attempt to close the show with The End becomes Th-Th-The , Th-Th-The , Th-Th .",
  "/wiki/Bob_Clampett": "Robert Emerson Clampett ( May 8 , 1913 - May 2 , 1984 ) was an American animator , producer , director , and puppeteer best known for his work on the Looney Tunes animated series from Warner Bros. , and the television shows Time for Beany and Beany and Cecil .

Clampett was promoted to a directorial position in 1937 and during his fifteen years at the studio , directed 84 cartoons later deemed classic and designed some of the studio 's most famous characters , including Porky Pig , Daffy Duck , and Tweety .

Cartoons in 1946 and turned his attention to television , creating the puppet show Time for Beany in 1949 . A later animated version of the series , titled Beany and Cecil , was initially broadcast on ABC in 1962 and was rerun until 1967 . The series is considered the first fully creator-driven television series , and carried the byline a Bob Clampett Cartoon . In his later years , Clampett toured college campuses and animation festivals as a lecturer on the history of animation . His Warner cartoons have seen renewed praise in decades since for their surrealistic qualities , energetic and outrageous animation , and irreverent humor . Animation historian Jerry Beck lauded Clampett for putting the word 'looney ' in Looney Tunes .",
