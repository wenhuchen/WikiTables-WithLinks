They have been peers of Ireland since at least the 13th century , and are described in the Annals of the Four Masters as being more Irish than the Irish themselves or Galls , due to assimilation with the native Gaelic aristocratic and popular culture . The dynasty has also been referred to as the Geraldines . They achieved power through the conquest of large swathes of Irish territory by the sons and grandsons of Gerald of Windsor ( c. 1075 - 1135 ) . Gerald of Windsor ( Gerald FitzWalter ) was a Norman castellan in Wales , and he is the male progenitor of the FitzMaurice and FitzGerald dynasty ( fitz , from the Anglo-Norman fils indicating sons of Gerald ) .

  "/wiki/Second_Desmond_Rebellion": "The Second Desmond Rebellion ( 1579-1583 ) was the more widespread and bloody of the two Desmond Rebellions in Ireland launched by the FitzGerald dynasty of Desmond in Munster against English rule . The second rebellion began in July 1579 when James FitzMaurice FitzGerald landed in Ireland with a force of Papal troops , triggering an insurrection across the south of Ireland on the part of the Desmond dynasty , their allies and others who were dissatisfied for various reasons with English government of the country . The rebellion ended with the 1583 death of Gerald FitzGerald , 15th Earl of Desmond , and the defeat of the rebels . The rebellion was in equal part a protest by feudal lords against the intrusion of central government into their domains ; a conservative Irish reaction to English policies that were altering traditional Gaelic society ; and a religious conflict , in which the rebels claimed that they were upholding Catholicism against a Protestant queen who had been pronounced a heretic in 1570 by the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis . The result of the rebellions was the destruction of the Desmond dynasty and the subsequent Munster Plantations - the colonisation of Munster with English settlers . In addition , the fighting laid waste to a large part of the south of Ireland . War-related famine and disease are thought to have killed up to a third of Munster 's pre-war population .",
  "/wiki/Nine_Years'_War_(Ireland)": "The Nine Years ' War , sometimes called Tyrone 's Rebellion , took place in Ireland from 1593 to 1603 . It was fought between an Irish alliance - led mainly by Hugh O'Neill of T\u00edr Eoghain and Hugh Roe O'Donnell of Tyrconnell - against English rule in Ireland , and was a response to the then-ongoing Tudor conquest of Ireland . The war was fought in all parts of the country , but mainly in the northern province of Ulster . The Irish alliance won some important early victories , such as the Battle of Clontibret ( 1595 ) and the Battle of the Yellow Ford ( 1598 ) , but the English won a decisive victory against the alliance and their Spanish allies in the Siege of Kinsale ( 1601-2 ) . The war ended with the Treaty of Mellifont ( 1603 ) . Many of the defeated northern lords left Ireland to seek support for a new uprising in the Flight of the Earls ( 1607 ) , never to return . This marked the end of Gaelic Ireland and led to the Plantation of Ulster . The war against O'Neill and his allies was the largest conflict fought by England in the Elizabethan era . At the height of the conflict ( 1600-1601 ) more than 18,000 soldiers were fighting in the English army in Ireland .

The coup failed and the rebellion developed into an ethnic conflict between Irish Catholics on one side , and English and Scottish Protestants on the other . The rebellion followed the Plantation of Ulster by Protestant settlers from Britain . It began a conflict known as the Irish Confederate Wars ( or Eleven Years ' War ) , which was part of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms . The rising was sparked by Catholic fears of an impending invasion of Ireland by anti-Catholic forces of the English Long Parliament and the Scottish Covenanters , who were defying the authority of King Charles I ( king of England , Scotland , and Ireland ) . In turn , the rebels ' suspected association with Charles helped start the English Civil War . The English and Scottish parliaments refused to raise an army to put down the rebellion unless it was under their command rather than the King 's . The Irish rebellion broke out in October 1641 and was followed by several months of violent chaos before the Irish Catholic upper classes and clergy formed the Catholic Confederation in May 1642 . The Confederation became a de facto government of most of Ireland , free from the control of the English administration and loosely aligned with the Royalist side in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms . The subsequent Irish Confederate Wars continued in Ireland until the 1650s , when Oliver Cromwell 's New Model Army decisively defeated the Irish Catholics and Royalists , and re-conquered the country .

  "/wiki/Williamite_War_in_Ireland": "The Williamite War in Ireland ( 1688-1691 ) ( Irish : Cogadh an D\u00e1 R\u00ed , war of the two kings ) , was a conflict between Jacobite supporters of King James II and Williamite supporters of Prince William of Orange . It is also called the Jacobite War in Ireland or the Williamite-Jacobite War in Ireland . The proximate cause of the war was the Glorious Revolution of 1688 , in which James , a Catholic , was overthrown as king of the Three Kingdoms of England , Ireland and Scotland and replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary and nephew and son-in-law William , ruling as joint monarchs . James 's supporters initially retained control of Ireland , which he hoped to use as a base for a campaign to reclaim all three kingdoms ; however , the conflict in Ireland also involved longstanding domestic issues of land ownership and religious and civic rights , and most Irish Catholics supported James in the hope he would address their grievances . A small number of English and Scottish Catholics , and Protestants of the established Church in Ireland , also fought on the Jacobite side , while most Irish Protestants supported or actively fought for William 's regime . While the war 's Irish name emphasises its aspect as a domestic conflict between James and William , some contemporaries and many modern commentators have viewed it as part of a wider European conflict known as the Nine Years ' War or War of the Grand Alliance in which William , as Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic , led a multi-national coalition against France under Louis XIV . William 's deposition of James was partly driven by his need to control and mobilise English military and commercial power , while Louis provided limited material support to the Jacobites : both sides were aware of the Irish war 's potential to divert military resources from the Continent . The war began with a series of skirmishes between James 's Irish Army , which had stayed loyal in 1688 , and militia forces raised by Irish Protestants : they culminated in the Siege of Derry , where the Jacobites failed to regain control of one of the north 's key towns . William landed a force including English , Scottish , Dutch , Danish and other troops to put down Jacobite resistance . James left Ireland after a reverse at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 , as did William after a successful Jacobite defence of Limerick ; the remaining Jacobite forces were decisively defeated at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691 , and negotiated terms in the Treaty of Limerick . A contemporary witness , George Story , calculated that the war had claimed 100,000 lives through sickness , famine , and in battle . Subsequent Jacobite risings were confined to Scotland and England , but the war was to have a lasting effect on the political and cultural landscape of Ireland , confirming British and Protestant rule over the country for over two centuries .",

The name is derived from Jacobus , the Latin version of James . When James II and VII went into exile after the 1688 Glorious Revolution , the Parliament of England argued he abandoned the English throne and offered it to his Protestant daughter Mary II and her husband William III . In April , the Scottish Convention held he 'forfeited ' the throne of Scotland by his actions , listed in the Articles of Grievances . The Revolution created the principle of a contract between monarch and people ; if that was violated , he or she could be removed . Jacobites argued monarchs were appointed by God , or divine right , and could not be removed , making the post 1688 regime illegitimate . While this was the most consistent difference , Jacobitism was a complex mix of ideas , many opposed by the Stuarts themselves ; in Ireland , it meant tolerance for Catholicism , which James supported , but also Irish autonomy and reversing the 17th century land settlements , which he opposed . In 1745 , the opposition of Scots Jacobites to the 1707 Union and divine right was central to the internal conflicts that ended it as a viable movement . Outside Ireland , Jacobitism was strongest in the western Scottish Highlands , Perthshire and Aberdeenshire and areas of Northern England with a high proportion of Catholics such as western Lancashire , Northumberland and County Durham . Sympathisers were also found in parts of Wales , and in the West Midlands and South West England , to some degree overlapping with the Royalist strongholds of the Civil War era . The movement had an international dimension ; several European powers sponsored the Jacobites as an extension of larger conflicts , while many Jacobite exiles served in foreign armies . In addition to the 1689-1691 Williamite War in Ireland and the simultaneous conflict in Scotland , there were open Jacobite revolts in Scotland and England in 1715 , 1719 and 1745-6 ; abortive French-backed invasion attempts in 1708 and 1744 ; and several unsuccessful plots .",
  "/wiki/James_II_of_England": "James II and VII ( 14 October 1633O.S . - 16 September 1701 ) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII , from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 . He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England , Scotland and Ireland ; his reign is now remembered primarily for struggles over religious tolerance . However , it also involved the principles of absolutism and divine right of kings and his deposition ended a century of political and civil strife by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown . James inherited the thrones of England , Ireland and Scotland from his elder brother Charles II with widespread support in all three countries , largely based on the principle of divine right or birth . Tolerance for his personal Catholicism did not apply to it in general and when the English and Scottish Parliaments refused to pass his measures , James attempted to impose them by decree ; it was a political principle , rather than a religious one , that ultimately led to his removal . In June 1688 , two events turned dissent into a crisis ; the first on 10 June was the birth of James 's son and heir James Francis Edward , threatening to create a Roman Catholic dynasty and excluding his Anglican daughter Mary and her Protestant husband William of Orange . The second was the prosecution of the Seven Bishops for seditious libel ; this was viewed as an assault on the Church of England and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed his political authority in England . Anti-Catholic riots in England and Scotland now made it seem only his removal as monarch could prevent a civil war . Leading members of the English political class invited William of Orange to assume the English throne ; after he landed in Brixham on 5 November 1688 , James 's army deserted , and he went into exile in France on 23 December . In February 1689 , a special Convention Parliament held that the king had vacated the English throne and installed William and Mary as joint monarchs , establishing the principle that sovereignty derived from Parliament , not birth . James landed in Ireland on 14 March 1689 in an attempt to recover his kingdoms , but despite a simultaneous rising in Scotland , in April a Scottish Convention followed that of England by finding that James had forfeited the throne and offered it to William and Mary .",

Located in Central Canada , it is Canada 's most populous province , with 38.3 percent of the country 's population , and is the second-largest province in total area . Ontario is fourth-largest jurisdiction in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included . It is home to the nation 's capital city , Ottawa , and the nation 's most populous city , Toronto , which is also Ontario 's provincial capital . Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west , Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north , and Quebec to the east and northeast , and to the south by the U.S. states of ( from west to east ) Minnesota , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York .

These include Rainy River , Pigeon River , Lake Superior , St. Marys River , Lake Huron , St. Clair River , Lake St. Clair , Detroit River , Lake Erie , Niagara River , Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from Kingston , Ontario , to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall , Ontario . There is only about 1 km ( 0.6 mi ) of land border , made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border . Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions , Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario . The great majority of Ontario 's population and arable land is in the south .

It is historically and politically considered to be part of Central Canada ( with Ontario ) . Quebec is the second-most populous province of Canada , after Ontario . It is the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population , with French as the sole provincial official language . Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City , the capital . Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area , including the Island of Montreal .

A number of separate incursions by the Fenian Brotherhood into Canada were undertaken to bring pressure on the United Kingdom to withdraw from Ireland , although none of these raids achieved their aims . In Canada , the incursions divided its Catholic Irish-Canadian population , many of whom were torn between loyalty to their new home and sympathy for the aims of the Fenians . The Protestant Irish were generally loyal to the British and fought with the anti-Catholic Orange Order against the Fenians . While authorities in the United States arrested the men and confiscated the arms of the Fenian Brotherhood , there were speculation that some in the United States government had turned a blind eye to the preparations undertaken by the Fenians ; because of anger over actions that could have been construed as British assistance to the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War .",

After the suppression of the Irish People newspaper , disaffection among Irish radical nationalists had continued to smoulder , and during the later part of 1866 , IRB leader James Stephens endeavoured to raise funds in the United States for a fresh rising planned for the following year . However the rising of 1867 proved to be poorly organised . There was a brief rising in County Kerry in February , followed by an attempt at nationwide insurrection , including an attempt to take Dublin in early March . Due to poor planning and British infiltration , the rebellion never got off the ground . Most of the leaders in Ireland were arrested , but although some of them were sentenced to death , none was executed . There followed a series of attacks in England aimed at freeing Fenian prisoners , including a bomb in London and an attack on prison van in Manchester , for which three Fenians , subsequently known as the Manchester martyrs , were executed . A series of raids into Canada by US-based supporters also accomplished little .",

The British colony was preceded by an earlier Dutch colony of the same name , the Kaap de Goede Hoop , established in 1652 by the Dutch East India Company . The Cape was under Dutch rule from 1652 to 1795 and again from 1803 to 1806 . The Dutch lost the colony to Great Britain following the 1795 Battle of Muizenberg , but had it returned following the 1802 Peace of Amiens . It was re-occupied by the UK following the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806 , and British possession affirmed with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 . The Cape of Good Hope then remained in the British Empire , becoming self-governing in 1872 , and uniting with three other colonies to form the Union of South Africa in 1910 . It then was renamed the Province of the Cape of Good Hope . South Africa became a sovereign state in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster . In 1961 it became the Republic of South Africa and obtained its own monetary unit called the Rand . Following the 1994 creation of the present-day South African provinces , the Cape Province was partitioned into the Eastern Cape , Northern Cape , and Western Cape , with smaller parts in North West province . The Cape of Good Hope was coextensive with the later Cape Province , stretching from the Atlantic coast inland and eastward along the southern coast , constituting about half of modern South Africa : the final eastern boundary , after several wars against the Xhosa , stood at the Fish River .

The Rising was launched by Irish republicans to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent Irish Republic while the United Kingdom was fighting the First World War . It was the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798 and the first armed action of the Irish revolutionary period . Sixteen of the Rising 's leaders were executed in May 1916 , but the insurrection , the nature of the executions , and subsequent political developments ultimately contributed to an increase in popular support for Irish independence . Organised by a seven-man Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood , the Rising began on Easter Monday , 24 April 1916 and lasted for six days . Members of the Irish Volunteers , led by schoolmaster and Irish language activist Patrick Pearse , joined by the smaller Irish Citizen Army of James Connolly and 200 women of Cumann na mBan , seized strategically important buildings in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic . The British Army brought in thousands of reinforcements as well as artillery and a gunboat . There was street fighting on the routes into the city centre , where the rebels slowed the British advance and inflicted many casualties . Elsewhere in Dublin , the fighting mainly consisted of sniping and long-range gun battles . The main rebel positions were gradually surrounded and bombarded with artillery . There were isolated actions in other parts of Ireland ; Volunteer leader Eoin MacNeill had issued a countermand in a bid to halt the Rising , which greatly reduced the number of rebels who mobilised . With much greater numbers and heavier weapons , the British Army suppressed the Rising .",

It was an escalation of the Irish revolutionary period into warfare . In April 1916 , Irish republicans launched the Easter Rising against British rule and proclaimed an Irish Republic . Although it was crushed after a week of fighting , the Easter Rising and the British response led to greater popular support for Irish independence . In the December 1918 election , the republican party Sinn F\u00e9in won a landslide victory in Ireland . On 21 January 1919 they formed a breakaway government ( D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ) and declared Irish independence . That day , two RIC officers were shot dead in the Soloheadbeg ambush by IRA volunteers acting on their own initiative . The conflict developed gradually . For much of 1919 , IRA activity involved capturing weaponry and freeing republican prisoners , while the D\u00e1il set about building a state . In September , the British government outlawed the D\u00e1il and Sinn F\u00e9in and the conflict intensified . The IRA began ambushing RIC and British Army patrols , attacking their barracks and forcing isolated barracks to be abandoned . The British government bolstered the RIC with recruits from Britain - the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries - who became notorious for ill-discipline and reprisal attacks on civilians , some of which were authorised by the British government .",

The ancestor of many groups also known as the Irish Republican Army , and distinguished from them as the Old IRA , it was descended from the Irish Volunteers , an organisation established on 25 November 1913 that staged the Easter Rising in April 1916 . In 1919 , the Irish Republic that had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising was formally established by an elected assembly ( D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ) , and the Irish Volunteers were recognised by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as its legitimate army . Thereafter , the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign against the British occupation of Ireland in the 1919-21 Irish War of Independence . Following the signing in 1921 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty , which ended the War of Independence , a split occurred within the IRA . Members who supported the treaty formed the nucleus of the Irish National Army . However , the majority of the IRA was opposed to the treaty . The anti-treaty IRA fought a civil war against the Free State Army in 1922-23 , with the intention of creating a fully independent all-Ireland republic . Having lost the civil war , this group remained in existence , with the intention of overthrowing the governments of both the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland and achieving the Irish Republic proclaimed in 1916 ."
