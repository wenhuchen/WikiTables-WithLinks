  "/wiki/Killer_Instinct_(1994_video_game)": "Killer Instinct is a fighting video game developed by Rare and published by Midway . It was released as an arcade game in the fall of 1994 and , the following year , ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) and the Game Boy . The game 's plot involves an all-powerful corporation organizing a fighting tournament . The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint . Despite a generic storyline , Killer Instinct featured more detailed graphics and more diverse characters than other games of its genre as well as some gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time . Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts , each player has two life bars . The player that depletes the other player 's life bars first wins the match . The game also introduced auto-doubles , a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents . Also featured in the game are combo breakers , special defensive moves that can interrupt combos . Critically acclaimed , Killer Instinct was followed by a sequel , the 1996 arcade game Killer Instinct 2 , later ported to the Nintendo 64 as Killer Instinct Gold , as well as a 2013 revival of the franchise as a launch title for Xbox One . A port of the original game is included with the 2013 game under the title Killer Instinct Classic . Retrospective lists by various publications included it among the best fighting games of all time .",

While exact dates are debated , the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s . Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s , the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost . The Eastern Hemisphere retains a strong arcade industry .",

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic New York City , in an effort to combine the urban landscape of Crysis 2 and the forest setting of the original Crysis . The game introduces the Seven Wonders , with each wonder having its own unique landscape and tactical layout . Due to complaints about Crysis 2 's linearity , the game 's levels were opened up so as to grant players more freedom . The development team also put efforts into creating a more emotional story , and the story 's protagonist was inspired by the lead character of District 9 . The game was developed by a team of 100 people during its 23-month development cycle ."
