Comcast has been criticized for multiple reasons ; its customer satisfaction often ranks among the lowest in the cable industry . In addition , Comcast has violated net neutrality practices in the past , and , despite Comcast 's commitment to a narrow definition of net neutrality , critics advocate a definition which precludes any distinction between Comcast 's private network services and the rest of the Internet . Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast 's service area ; there is limited competition among cable providers . Furthermore , given Comcast 's negotiating power as a large ISP , some suspect that Comcast could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds . Its ownership of both content production ( in NBCUniversal ) and content distribution ( as an ISP ) has raised antitrust concerns ."
