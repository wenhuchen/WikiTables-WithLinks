  "/wiki/Maultaschen": "Maultaschen ( singular Maultasche ( help\u00b7info ) ) is a traditional German dish that originated in the region of Swabia . It consists of an outer-layer of pasta dough which encloses a filling traditionally consisting of minced meat , smoked meat , spinach , bread crumbs and onions and flavored with various herbs and spices ( e.g . pepper , parsley and nutmeg ) . Maultaschen are similar to the Italian ravioli but are typically larger in size - each Maultasche being approximately 8-12 centimeters ( 3-5 inches ) across . They are almost invariably square or rectangular in shape . On 22 October 2009 , the European Union recognized Maultaschen ( Schw\u00e4bische Maultaschen or Schw\u00e4bische Suppenmaultaschen ) as a regional specialty and remarked that the dish is significant to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg . This measure provides protection to the integrity of the dish , mandating that genuine Maultaschen are only produced in Swabia , a historical region that was incorporated into the modern German states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria .",
  "/wiki/Brenntar": "Brenntar or Habermus or Schwarzer Brei was a Swabian staple foodstuff , particularly prominent in the Swabian Jura and in the Allg\u00e4u . It is made of roasted flour , usually spelt flour or oat flour . This kiln-dried flour is called Musmehl . It is usually cooked like a porridge with water and milk . Brenntar and Musmehl are closely related to the Tibetan staple food tsampa . The name Brenntar means literally 'burned porridge ' and Schwarzer Brei means 'black porridge ' . That is perhaps ironic , because Brenntar is brown , if everything is done correctly . However , the flour can also turn black if roasted too long in the drying kiln .",
  "/wiki/Sauerbraten": "Sauerbraten is a traditional German roast of heavily marinated meat . It is regarded as a national dish of Germany , and is frequently served in German-style restaurants internationally .

Before cooking , the raw meat is marinated for three to ten days in a mixture of vinegar or wine , water , herbs , spices , and seasonings . Usually , tougher cuts of meat such as rump roast or bottom round of beef are used , and the long marinating tenderizes the meat .

  "/wiki/Gaisburger_Marsch": "Gaisburger Marsch ( German for march of Gaisburg ) is a traditional Swabian beef stew , named after Gaisburg , a district of Stuttgart . The meat , cooked in a strong beef broth , is cut into cubes and served with cooked potatoes and Sp\u00e4tzle . The broth is poured over the dish before topping with golden-brown onions fried in butter . One explanation for the name Gaisburger Marsch is that the dish was so popular in the 19th century among officer candidates that they marched all the way to Gaisburg where their favorite dish was served in the restaurant called B\u00e4ckerschmide . Another version claims that locals from Gaisburg became prisoners of war and their women were only allowed to bring them one meal every day , so they created this nourishing dish and marched with it to the camp . The district of Gaisburg ( today part Stuttgart Ost ) hosts annual celebrations with a festival lasting several days . Gaisburger Marsch is the favourite food of ex-Bundespr\u00e4sident Horst K\u00f6hler , Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Chef Harald Wohlfahrt .",
