As a person 's condition declines , they often withdraw from family and society . Gradually , bodily functions are lost , ultimately leading to death . Although the speed of progression can vary , the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years . The cause of Alzheimer 's disease is poorly understood . About 70% of the risk is believed to be inherited from a person 's parents with many genes usually involved . Other risk factors include a history of head injuries , depression , and hypertension . The disease process is associated with plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain . A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes .",

Comedy , compared with other film genres , puts much more focus on individual stars , with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity .

  "/wiki/Civic_Duty": "Civic engagement or civic participation is any individual or group activity addressing issues of public concern . Citizens acting alone or together to protect public values or make a change or difference in the community are common types of civic engagement . Civic engagement includes communities working together in both political and non-political actions . The goal of civic engagement is to address public concerns and promote the quality of the community . Civic Engagement is a process in which people take collective action to address issues of public concern and is absolutely instrumental to democracy ( Checkoway & Aldana , 2012 ) . Underrepresentation of groups in the government cause issues faced by groups such as minority , low-income , and younger groups to be overlooked or ignored . In turn , issues for higher voting groups are addressed more frequently causing more bills to be passed to fix these problems ( Griffin & Newman , 2008 ) . Understanding all options of civic engagement does develop and emergence of diversity democracy which is defined as a way to influence agency decisions from ways outside of voting ( Checkoway & Aldana , 2013 ) . An informed voter is beneficial for a democracy and the only way for this to occur is through education . One potential solution is to create a mandatory training course for younger voters to learn of the opportunities with civic engagement . Additionally historically lower voter turnout groups may lack basic resources to understand how to register to vote or even how to get to voting locations .",

These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters .

In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",
