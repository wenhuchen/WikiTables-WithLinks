The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs . Entrepreneurship has been described as the capacity and willingness to develop , organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit . While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses , due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up , a significant proportion of start-up businesses have to close due to lack of funding , bad business decisions , an economic crisis , lack of market demand , or a combination of all of these . A broader definition of the term is sometimes used , especially in the field of economics . In this usage , an Entrepreneur is an entity which has the ability to find and act upon opportunities to translate inventions or technologies into products and services : The entrepreneur is able to recognize the commercial potential of the invention and organize the capital , talent , and other resources that turn an invention into a commercially viable innovation . In this sense , the term Entrepreneurship also captures innovative activities on the part of established firms , in addition to similar activities on the part of new businesses . Coming up with an idea for a product or service is not the hardest thing for startups and entrepreneurs . Building a product isnt even the hardest . Truly , the hardest part is making it work , or in other words , getting people to like and want to buy your product , and beating the competition at the same time",
