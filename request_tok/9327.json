In the middle of the plaza , Sonoma 's early 20th-century city hall , at the plaza 's center and still in use , was designed and built with four identical sides in order not to offend the merchants on any one side of the plaza . The plaza is a National Historic Landmark and still serves as the town 's focal point , hosting many community festivals and drawing tourists all year round . It provides a central tourist attraction . It is also the location of the Farmer 's Market , held every Tuesday in the summer . Sonoma City Hall was dedicated in 1908 . This location was where the Bear Flag Revolt took place in 1846 , which led to the founding of the short lived Republic of California . For many years , the site in Sonoma Plaza where the bear flag originally had been raised went unmarked . Largely through the efforts of the Native Sons of the Golden West , the legislature appropriated $ 5,000 for a monument to be placed there . The Native Sons of the Golden West raised $ 500 to prepare the site , put on dedication ceremonies , and to move the huge rock that serves as the pedestal from a mile away .",
