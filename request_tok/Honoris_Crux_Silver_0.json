  "/wiki/Corporal": "Corporal is a military rank in use in some form by many militaries and by some police forces or other uniformed organizations . Within NATO , each member nation 's corresponding military rank of corporal is combined under the NATO-standard rank scale code OR-3 or OR-4 . However , there are often differences in how each nation ( or service in each nation ) employs corporals . Some militaries do n't have corporals , but may instead have a Junior Sergeant . In some militaries , the rank of corporal nominally corresponds to commanding a section or squad of soldiers . However , in the United States Army , the rank of corporal is considered a lateral promotion from E-4 Specialist and usually only occurs when the soldier has been selected by a promotion board to become an E-5 Sergeant and is serving in an E-5 billet such as a fireteam leader in a rifle squad . The lateral promotion is used to make the soldier a non-commissioned officer without changing the soldier 's pay . As the Table of Organization & Equipment ( TO & E ) rank of a fire team leader is sergeant and that of squad leader is staff sergeant . In the United States Marine Corps , corporal is the Table of Organization ( TO ) rank for a rifle fire team leader , machine gun team leader , light mortar squad leader , and assault weapon squad leader , as well as gunner on most larger crew served weapons ( i.e . medium mortars , heavy machine guns , and anti-tank missiles ) , armored vehicles ( e.g . tanks , light armored vehicles , and armored assault vehicles ) , and the two assistant gunners on a howitzer ( the gunner is a sergeant ) . In most countries that derive their military structure from the British military system , corporal is a more senior rank than that of private .",

  "/wiki/South_African_Army": "The South African Army is the army of South Africa , first formed after the Union of South Africa was created in 1910 . The South African military evolved within the tradition of frontier warfare fought by Boer Commando ( militia ) forces , reinforced by the Afrikaners ' historical distrust of large standing armies . It then fought as part of the wider British effort in World War II , but afterwards was cut off from its long-standing Commonwealth ties with the ascension to power of the National Party in South Africa in 1948 . The army was involved in a long and bitter counter-insurgency campaign in Namibia from 1966 to 1990 . It also played a key role in controlling sectarian political violence inside South Africa during the late 1980s and early 1990s . The role of the Army was fundamentally changed by the upheavals of the early 1990s and after 1994 the Army became part of the new South African National Defence Force . It is now becoming increasingly involved in peacekeeping efforts in southern Africa , often as part of wider African Union operations . The Army is composed of roughly 40,100 regular uniformed personnel , augmented by 12,300 reserve force personnel . The rank/age structure of the army , which deteriorated desperately during the 1990s , is greatly improving through the Military Skills Development ( MSDS ) voluntary national service system . Through this system , young healthy members are being inducted into the regular and reserve forces every year .",

  "/wiki/Killed_in_action": "Killed in action ( KIA ) is a casualty classification generally used by militaries to describe the deaths of their own combatants at the hands of hostile forces . The United States Department of Defense , for example , says that those declared KIA need not have fired their weapons but have been killed due to hostile attack . KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events . [ citation needed ] Further , KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas died of wounds ( DOW ) relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) also uses DWRIA , rather than DOW , for died of wounds received in action . However , historically , militaries and historians have used the former acronym . [ citation needed ] PKIA means presumed killed in action . This term is used when personnel are lost in battle , initially listed missing in action ( MIA ) , but after not being found , are later presumed to have not survived .",
  "/wiki/1_Reconnaissance_Commando_(South_Africa)": "The 1 Reconnaissance Commando was the first South African special forces unit , founded by General Fritz Loots - the founder of the South African Special Forces , and the first General Officer Commanding of the South African Special Forces . He appointed 11 qualified paratroopers ( known as The Dirty Dozen , although they were made up of only 11 men ) as the founder members . Included in these 11 paratroopers was Jan Breytenbach , who was placed in command of the Founder Members by General Loots .",
  "/wiki/Trooper_(rank)": "Trooper ( abbr . Tpr ) from the French troupier is the equivalent rank to private in a regiment with a cavalry tradition in the British Army and many other Commonwealth armies , including those of Australia , Canada , South Africa and New Zealand ; it is also used by the Irish Army . In the British Army the Royal Tank Regiment , although not a former cavalry unit also uses the term Trooper as do the Special Air Service and Honourable Artillery Company . Airtrooper ( Atpr ) is used in the Army Air Corps . Cavalry units are organized into squadrons , further divided into troops , hence a trooper is a member of a troop . Trooper can also be used colloquially to mean any cavalry soldier ( although not usually an officer ) . In the United States cavalry and airborne , trooper is a colloquialism that has traditionally been used not as a rank , but rather as a general term for any enlisted soldier . Cavalry Troopers are generally considered to be socially a cut above other soldiers . This distinction stems from the days when cavalry needed to supply their own horses and equipment , and so would need to be reasonably wealthy and a gentleman of sorts . In addition cavalry regiments were seen to be relatively fashionable and dashing , often having colourful or even garish uniforms .",

The meaning of lieutenant differs in different militaries ( see comparative military ranks ) , but is often subdivided into senior ( first lieutenant ) and junior ( second lieutenant and even third lieutenant ) ranks . In navies it is often equivalent to the army rank of captain ; it may also indicate a particular post rather than a rank . The rank is also used in fire services , emergency medical services , security services and police forces . Lieutenant may also appear as part of a title used in various other organisations with a codified command structure . It often designates someone who is second-in-command , and as such , may precede the name of the rank directly above it . For example , a lieutenant master is likely to be second-in-command to the master in an organisation using both ranks . Political uses include lieutenant governor in various governments , and Quebec lieutenant in Canadian politics . In the United Kingdom , a lord lieutenant is the sovereign 's representative in a county or lieutenancy area , while a deputy lieutenant is one of the lord lieutenant 's deputies .",

  "/wiki/South_African_Air_Force": "The South African Air Force ( SAAF ) is the air force of South Africa , with its headquarters in Pretoria . The South African Air Force was established on 1 February 1920 . The Air Force has seen service in World War II and the Korean War . From 1966 the SAAF was involved in providing infantry support in a low intensity war ( The Border War ) in Angola , South-West Africa ( Namibia ) and Rhodesia . As the war progressed , the intensity of air operations increased until in the late 1980s , the SAAF were compelled to fly fighter missions against Angolan aircraft in order to maintain tactical air superiority . On conclusion of the Border War in 1990 , aircraft numbers were severely reduced due to economic pressures as well as the cessation of hostilities with neighbouring states . Today the SAAF has a limited air combat capability and has been structured towards regional peace-keeping , disaster relief and maritime patrol operations . During the apartheid era , it was also known by its Afrikaans name of Suid-Afrikaanse Lugmag ( SALM , lit . South African Air Force ) , a moniker which has since been depreciated .",
  "/wiki/Captain_(armed_forces)": "The army rank of captain ( from the French capitaine ) is a commissioned officer rank historically corresponding to the command of a company of soldiers . The rank is also used by some air forces and marine forces . Today , a captain is typically either the commander or second-in-command of a company or artillery battery ( or United States Army cavalry troop or Commonwealth squadron ) . In the Chinese People 's Liberation Army , a captain may also command a company , or be the second-in-command of a battalion . In NATO countries , the rank of captain is described by the code OF-2 and is one rank above an OF-1 ( lieutenant or first lieutenant ) and one below an OF-3 ( major or commandant ) . The rank of captain is generally considered [ by whom ? ] to be the highest rank a soldier can achieve while remaining in the field . In some militaries , such as United States Army and Air Force and the British Army , captain is the entry-level rank for officer candidates possessing a professional degree , namely , most medical professionals ( doctors , pharmacists , dentists ) and lawyers . In the U.S. Army , lawyers who are not already officers at captain rank or above enter as lieutenants during training , and are promoted to the rank of captain after completion of their training if they are in the active component , or after a certain amount of time , usually one year from their date of commission as a lieutenant , for the reserve components . The rank of captain should not be confused with the naval rank of captain or with the UK-influenced air force rank of group captain , both of which are equivalent to the army rank of colonel .",

  "/wiki/Sergeant": "Sergeant ( /\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0 ( r ) d\u0292\u0259nt/ SARJ-\u0259nt ; abbreviated to Sgt . and capitalized when used as a named person 's title ) is a rank in many uniformed organizations , principally military and policing forces . The alternative spelling , serjeant , is used in The Rifles and other units that draw their heritage from the British Light Infantry . Its origin is the Latin serviens , 'one who serves ' , through the French term sergent . The term sergeant refers to a non-commissioned officer placed above the rank of a corporal and a police officer immediately below a lieutenant or , in the UK Police forces , below an inspector . In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major . Many countries use sergeant rank , whether in English or using a cognate with the same origin in another language .
