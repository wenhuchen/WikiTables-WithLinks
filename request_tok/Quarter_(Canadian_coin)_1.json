  "/wiki/Alberta": "Alberta is a province of Canada . With an estimated population of 4,067,175 as of 2016 census , it is Canada 's fourth most populous province and the most populous of Canada 's three prairie provinces . Its area is about 660,000 square kilometres ( 250,000 sq mi ) . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1 , 1905 . The premier is Jason Kenney as of April 30 , 2019 . Alberta is bordered by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year ; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming . Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries . About 290 km ( 180 mi ) south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta . Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta 's two census metropolitan areas , both of which have populations exceeding one million , while the province has 16 census agglomerations . Tourist destinations in the province include Banff , Canmore , Drumheller , Jasper , Sylvan Lake and Lake Louise .",
  "/wiki/Badlands": "Badlands are a type of dry terrain where softer sedimentary rocks and clay-rich soils have been extensively eroded by wind and water . They are characterized by steep slopes , minimal vegetation , lack of a substantial regolith , and high drainage density . They can resemble malpa\u00eds , a terrain of volcanic rock . Canyons , ravines , gullies , buttes , mesas , hoodoos and other such geologic forms are common in badlands . They are often difficult to navigate by foot . Badlands often have a spectacular color display that alternates from dark black/blue coal stria to bright clays to red scoria .",
  "/wiki/British_Columbia": "British Columbia ( BC ; French : Colombie-Britannique ) is the westernmost province in Canada , located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains . With an estimated population of 5.1 million as of 2019 [ update ] , it is Canada 's third-most populous province . The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) . The capital of British Columbia is Victoria , the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada , named for Queen Victoria , who ruled during the creation of the original colonies . The largest city is Vancouver , the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada , the largest in Western Canada , and the second-largest in the Pacific Northwest .",
  "/wiki/Killer_whale": "The killer whale or orca ( Orcinus orca ) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family , of which it is the largest member . Killer whales have a diverse diet , although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey . Some feed exclusively on fish , while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin . They have been known to attack baleen whale calves , and even adult whales . Killer whales are apex predators , as no animal preys on them . A cosmopolitan species , they can be found in each of the world 's oceans in a variety of marine environments , from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas , absent only from the Baltic and Black seas , and some areas of the Arctic Ocean . Killer whales are highly social ; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups ( pods ) which are the most stable of any animal species . Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours , which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations , have been described as manifestations of animal culture . The International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses the orca 's conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species . Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion , habitat loss , pollution ( by PCBs ) , capture for marine mammal parks , and conflicts with human fisheries . In late 2005 , the southern resident killer whales , which swim in British Columbia and Washington state waters , were placed on the U.S . Endangered Species list .",
  "/wiki/Coast_Mountains": "The Coast Mountains are a major mountain range in the Pacific Coast Ranges of western North America , extending from southwestern Yukon through the Alaska Panhandle and virtually all of the Coast of British Columbia south to the Fraser River . The mountain range 's name derives from its proximity to the sea coast , and it is often referred to as the Coast Range . The range includes volcanic and non-volcanic mountains and the extensive ice fields of the Pacific and Boundary Ranges , and the northern end of the volcanic system known as the Cascade Volcanoes . The Coast Mountains are part of a larger mountain system called the Pacific Coast Ranges or the Pacific Mountain System , which includes the Cascade Range , the Insular Mountains , the Olympic Mountains , the Oregon Coast Range , the California Coast Ranges , the Saint Elias Mountains and the Chugach Mountains . The Coast Mountains are also part of the American Cordillera - a Spanish term for an extensive chain of mountain ranges - that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western backbone of North America , Central America , South America and Antarctica . The Coast Mountains are approximately 1,600 kilometres ( 1,000 mi ) long and average 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) in width . The range 's southern and southeastern boundaries are surrounded by the Fraser River and the Interior Plateau while its far northwestern edge is delimited by the Kelsall and Tatshenshini Rivers at the north end of the Alaska Panhandle , beyond which are the Saint Elias Mountains , and by Champagne Pass in the Yukon Territory . Covered in dense temperate rainforest on its western exposures , the range rises to heavily glaciated peaks , including the largest temperate-latitude ice fields in the world . On its eastern flanks , the range tapers to the dry Interior Plateau and the subarctic boreal forests of the Skeena Mountains and Stikine Plateau . The Coast Mountains are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire - the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean - and contain some of British Columbia 's highest mountains . Mount Waddington is the highest mountain of the Coast Mountains and the highest that lies entirely within British Columbia , located northeast of the head of Knight Inlet with an elevation of 4,019 metres ( 13,186 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Manitoba": "Manitoba ( /\u02ccm\u00e6n\u026a\u02c8to\u028ab\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada . It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and is Canada 's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.369 million people . Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province . Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada .",
  "/wiki/Hudson's_Bay_Company": "The Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ; French : Compagnie de la Baie d'Hudson ) is a Canadian retail business group . A fur trading business for much of its existence , HBC now owns and operates retail stores in Canada and the United States . The company sold most of its European operations by August 2019 and its remaining stores , in the Netherlands , were closed by the end of 2019 . HBC owns the Saks stores in the US ; most other US operations were sold by mid-2019 and the last remaining stores ( Lord & Taylor chain ) were sold prior to the end of 2019 . The company 's namesake business division is Hudson 's Bay , commonly referred to as The Bay ( La Baie in French ) . After incorporation by English royal charter in 1670 , the company functioned as the de facto government in parts of North America for nearly 200 years until the HBC sold the land it owned ( the entire Hudson Bay drainage basin , known as Rupert 's Land ) to Canada in 1869 as part of The Deed of Surrender , authorised by the Rupert 's Land Act 1868 . During its peak , the company controlled the fur trade throughout much of the English- and later British-controlled North America . By the mid-19th century , the company evolved into a mercantile business selling a wide variety of products from furs to fine homeware in a small number of sales shops ( as opposed to trading posts ) across Canada . These shops were the first step towards the department stores the company owns today . In 2008 , HBC was acquired by NRDC Equity Partners , which also owns the upmarket American department store Lord & Taylor . From 2008 to 2012 , the HBC was run through a holding company of NRDC , Hudson 's Bay Trading Company , which was dissolved in early 2012 .

  "/wiki/New_Brunswick": "New Brunswick is one of four Atlantic provinces on the east coast of Canada . According to the Constitution of Canada , New Brunswick is the only bilingual province . About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones , and one third francophones . One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual . Atypically for Canada , only about half of the population lives in urban areas , mostly in Greater Moncton , Greater Saint John and the capital Fredericton . Unlike the other Maritime provinces , New Brunswick 's terrain is mostly forested uplands , with much of the land further from the coast , giving it a harsher climate . New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely-populated than the rest of the Maritimes . Being relatively close to Europe , New Brunswick was among the first places in North America to be explored and settled by Europeans , starting with the French in the early 1600s , who displaced the indigenous Mi'kmaq , Maliseet , and the Passamaquoddy peoples . The French settlers were later displaced when the area became part of the British Empire . In 1784 , after an influx of refugees from the American Revolutionary War , the province was partitioned from Nova Scotia . In 1785 Saint John became Canada 's first incorporated city . The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly , reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century .",

These structures are found in northern Canada , Greenland , and Alaska ( United States ) . This combined region , above the Arctic Circle , is dominated by the tundra biome and has areas with few natural landmarks . The inuksuk may historically have been used for navigation , as a point of reference , a marker for travel routes , fishing places , camps , hunting grounds , places of veneration , drift fences used in hunting , or to mark a food cache . The I\u00f1upiat in northern Alaska used inuksuit to assist in the herding of caribou into contained areas for slaughter . Varying in shape and size , the inuksuit have ancient roots in Inuit culture . Historically , the most common types of inuksuk are built with stone placed upon stone . The simplest type is a single stone positioned in an upright manner . There is some debate as to whether the appearance of human- or cross-shaped cairns developed in the Inuit culture before the arrival of European missionaries and explorers . [ citation needed ] The size of some inuksuit suggest that the construction was often a communal effort . At Inuksuk Point ( Enukso Point ) on Baffin Island , there are more than 100 inuksuit .

  "/wiki/Grain_elevator": "A grain elevator is an agrarian facility complex designed to stockpile or store grain . In grain trade , the term grain elevator also describes a tower containing a bucket elevator or a pneumatic conveyor , which scoops up grain from a lower level and deposits it in a silo or other storage facility . In most cases , the term grain elevator also describes the entire elevator complex , including receiving and testing offices , weighbridges , and storage facilities . It may also mean organizations that operate or control several individual elevators , in different locations . In Australia the term grain elevator describes only the lifting mechanism . ( See Usage , below . ) Before the advent of the grain elevator , grain was usually handled in bags rather than in bulk ( large quantities of loose grain ) . Dart 's Elevator was a major innovation . It was invented by Joseph Dart , a merchant , and Robert Dunbar , an engineer , in 1842 and 1843 , in Buffalo , New York . Using the steam-powered flour mills of Oliver Evans as their model , they invented the marine leg , which scooped loose grain out of the hulls of ships and elevated it to the top of a marine tower . Early grain elevators and bins were often built of framed or cribbed wood , and were prone to fire . Grain-elevator bins , tanks , and silos are now usually made of steel or reinforced concrete .",
