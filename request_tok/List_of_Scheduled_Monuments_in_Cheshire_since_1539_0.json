  "/wiki/Anderton_Boat_Lift": "The Anderton Boat Lift is a two caisson lift lock near the village of Anderton , Cheshire , in North West England . It provides a 50-foot ( 15.2 m ) vertical link between two navigable waterways : the River Weaver and the Trent and Mersey Canal . The structure is designated as a scheduled monument , and is included in the National Heritage List for England . Built in 1875 , the boat lift was in use for over 100 years until it was closed in 1983 due to corrosion . Restoration started in 2001 and the boat lift was re-opened in 2002 . The lift and associated visitor centre and exhibition are operated by the Canal & River Trust . It is one of only two working boat lifts in the United Kingdom ; the other is the Falkirk Wheel in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/River_Weaver": "The River Weaver is a river , navigable in its lower reaches , running in a curving route anti-clockwise across west Cheshire , northern England . Improvements to the river to make it navigable were authorised in 1720 and the work , which included eleven locks , was completed in 1732 . An unusual clause in the enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that profits should be given to the County of Cheshire for the improvement of roads and bridges , but the navigation was not initially profitable , and it was 1775 before the first payments were made . Trade continued to rise , and by 1845 , over \u00a3500,000 had been given to the county . The major trade was salt . The arrival of the Trent and Mersey Canal at Anderton in 1773 was detrimental to the salt trade at first , but ultimately beneficial , as salt was tipped down chutes from the canal into barges on the river navigation . Access to the river was improved in 1810 by the Weston Canal , which provided a link to Weston Point , where boats could reach the River Mersey at most states of the tide , as the water was deeper . The navigation was completely reconstructed between 1870 and 1900 , with the original locks being replaced by five much larger locks , capable of handling 1000-tonne coasters . With the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal , a new lock was constructed at Weston Marsh , which gave direct access to the ship canal without having to pass through the docks at Weston Point . All water from the river entered the canal nearby , and any surplus was released into the Mersey through the Weaver sluices , which were located just upstream of the junction . A notable feature is the Anderton Boat Lift , which is near Northwich , and links the Weaver with the Trent and Mersey Canal some 50 feet ( 15 m ) above . It was opened in 1875 , to allow canal boats to reach the Weaver , and although closed on safety grounds in 1983 , it was refurbished and reopened in 2002 .",

  "/wiki/Cast_iron": "Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2% . Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature . The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured : white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through , grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks , and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite nodules which stop the crack from further progressing . Carbon ( C ) ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt% , and silicon ( Si ) 1-3 wt% , are the main alloying elements of cast iron . Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel . Cast iron tends to be brittle , except for malleable cast irons . With its relatively low melting point , good fluidity , castability , excellent machinability , resistance to deformation and wear resistance , cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes , machines and automotive industry parts , such as cylinder heads , cylinder blocks and gearbox cases . It is resistant to damage by oxidation . The earliest cast-iron artefacts date to the 5th century BC , and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu in China . Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare , agriculture , and architecture . During the 15th century , cast iron became utilized for cannon in Burgundy , France , and in England during the Reformation . The amounts of cast iron used for cannon required large scale production .",

  "/wiki/Shropshire_Union_Canal": "The Shropshire Union Canal , nicknamed the Shroppie , is a navigable canal in England . The Llangollen and Montgomery canals are the modern names of branches of the Shropshire Union ( SU ) system and lie partially in Wales . The canal lies in the counties of Staffordshire , Shropshire and Cheshire in the north-west English Midlands . It links the canal system of the West Midlands , at Wolverhampton , with the River Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal at Ellesmere Port , Cheshire , 66 miles ( 106 km ) distant . The SU main line runs southeast from Ellesmere Port on the River Mersey to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley Junction in Wolverhampton . Other links are to the Llangollen Canal ( at Hurleston Junction ) , the Middlewich Branch ( at Barbridge Junction ) , which itself connects via the Wardle Canal with the Trent and Mersey Canal , and the River Dee ( in Chester ) . With two connections to the Trent and Mersey ( via the Middlewich Branch and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal ) the SU is part of an important circular and rural holiday route called the Four Counties Ring . The SU main line was the last trunk narrow canal route to be built in England . It was not completed until 1835 and was the last major civil engineering accomplishment of Thomas Telford . The name Shropshire Union comes from the amalgamation of the various component companies ( Ellesmere Canal , Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal , Montgomeryshire Canal ) that came together to form the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company . The main line between Nantwich and Autherley Junction was almost built as a railway although eventually it was decided to construct it as a waterway .",

Some were underground chambers , usually man-made , close to natural sources of winter ice such as freshwater lakes , but many were buildings with various types of insulation . During the winter , ice and snow would be cut from lakes or rivers , taken into the ice house , and packed with insulation ( often straw or sawdust ) . It would remain frozen for many months , often until the following winter , and could be used as a source of ice during the summer months . The main application of the ice was the storage of foods , but it could also be used simply to cool drinks , or in the preparation of ice-cream and sorbet desserts . During the heyday of the ice trade , a typical commercial ice house would store 2,700 tonnes ( 3,000 short tons ) of ice in a 30-by-100-foot ( 9 by 30 m ) and 14-metre-high ( 45 ft ) building .",

  "/wiki/River_Dane": "The River Dane is a tributary of the River Weaver that originates in the Peak District area of England . It forms the border between first Cheshire and Derbyshire on the west and east , and then between Cheshire and Staffordshire where it then flows north-west through Cheshire before meeting the Weaver near Northwich . The river rises close to the source of the River Goyt just to the south west of Buxton , on Axe Edge Moor . Flowing southwest , it forms county borders for around 10 miles ( 16 km ) before flowing west through Congleton and past Holmes Chapel . The point on the river where the three counties meet , at Panniers ' Pool Bridge , is called Three Shire Heads ( sometimes Three Shires Head ) . Passing just north of Middlewich , it merges first with the River Croco near the site of the old Roman fort in Harbutt 's Field , and then with the River Wheelock near the aqueduct carrying the Trent and Mersey Canal , and runs the remaining 5 miles ( 8 km ) north to Northwich where it flows into the River Weaver . The name of the river ( earlier Daven ) is probably from the Old Welsh dafn , meaning a drop or trickle , implying a slow-moving river . The route of the Dane is followed as closely as possible by the Dane Valley Way , a 48-mile ( 77 km ) walking route from Buxton to Northwich . Although the main river is part of the Mersey catchment and flows into the Irish Sea , a portion of the water can be diverted via canal feeders into Rudyard Lake and subsequently the Caldon Canal .

Some had a single mast , with a fore-and-aft rig , while some had an additional mizzen mast . Despite having a flat bottom and curved sides , they were quite stable . They were common from the 1730s to 1890s . As the name suggests , these flats originated on the River Mersey , but they were also used on the rivers Irwell and Weaver . The length of a flat was from 62 to 70 feet ( 19 to 21 m ) long , with a 6-foot ( 1.8 m ) draught and a beam of 14 feet 9 inches to 17 feet ( 4.5 to 5.2 m ) . They could carry up to 80 tons of cargo , and this size allowed them to work along the Bridgewater Canal , the Sankey Canal and the northern parts of the Shropshire Union Canal . The Weaver flat was a larger version of the Mersey flat , measuring 90 by 21 feet ( 27.4 by 6.4 m ) . Its draught was 10.5 feet ( 3.2 m ) and when fully loaded , could carry 250 tons . Most Mersey flats had been converted to dumb barges by the end of the 19th century , towed by horses or by steam tugs .

  "/wiki/Elizabethan_era": "The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor period of the history of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I ( 1558-1603 ) . Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history . The symbol of Britannia ( a female personification of Great Britain ) was first used in 1572 , and often thereafter , to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals , international expansion , and naval triumph over Spain . The historian John Guy ( 1988 ) argues that England was economically healthier , more expansive , and more optimistic under the Tudors than at any time in a thousand years . This golden age represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of poetry , music and literature . The era is most famous for theatre , as William Shakespeare and many others composed plays that broke free of England 's past style of theatre . It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad , while back at home , the Protestant Reformation became more acceptable to the people , most certainly after the Spanish Armada was repelled . It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland . The Elizabethan age contrasts sharply with the previous and following reigns . It was a brief period of internal peace between the English Reformation and the religious battles between Protestants and Catholics and then the political battles between parliament and the monarchy that engulfed the remainder of the seventeenth century . The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled , for a time , by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism . England was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe .",

  "/wiki/Battlement": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons .

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

The first documented use of the word gamecock , denoting use of the cock as to a game , a sport , pastime or entertainment , was recorded in 1634 , after the term cock of the game used by George Wilson , in the earliest known book on the sport of cockfighting in The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting in 1607 . But it was during Magellan 's voyage of discovery of the Philippines in 1521 when modern cockfighting was first witnessed and documented by Antonio Pigafetta , Magellan 's chronicler , in the kingdom of Taytay . The combatants , referred to as gamecocks ( not to be confused with game birds ) , are specially bred and conditioned for increased stamina and strength . Male and female chickens of such a breed are referred to as game fowl . Cocks possess congenital aggression toward all males of the same species . Wagers are often made on the outcome of the match . Cockfighting is a blood sport due in some part to the physical trauma the cocks inflict on each other , which is sometimes increased by attaching metal spurs to the cocks ' natural spurs . While not all fights are to the death , the cocks may endure significant physical trauma . In some areas around the world , cockfighting is still practiced as a mainstream event ; in some countries it is regulated by law , or forbidden outright . Advocates of the age old sport often list cultural and religious relevance as reasons for perpetuation of cockfighting as a sport .",
