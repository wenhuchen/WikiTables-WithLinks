  "/wiki/Bugs_Bunny": "Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character , created in the late 1930s by Leon Schlesinger Productions ( later Warner Bros. Cartoons ) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc . Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films , produced by Warner Bros . Though a similar character called Happy Rabbit debuted in the WB cartoon Porky 's Hare Hunt ( 1938 ) and appeared in a few subsequent shorts , the definitive character of Bugs is widely credited to have made his debut in director Tex Avery 's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare ( 1940 ) . Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant , insouciant personality . He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent , his portrayal as a trickster , and his catch phrase Eh.What 's up , doc ? . Due to Bugs ' popularity during the golden age of American animation , he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment , but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world . He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos . Since his debut , Bugs has appeared in various short films , feature films , compilations , TV series , music records , comics , video games , award shows , amusement park rides , and commercials . He has also appeared in more films than any other cartoon character , is the 9th most-portrayed film personality in the world , and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .",

He 's just a little , almost elfin creature who 's not really out to hurt anybody or has any ill will or malice toward anybody . He 's just absolutely out of his mind .
