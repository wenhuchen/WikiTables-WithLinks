  "/wiki/Kozloduy_NPP": "The Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant is a nuclear power plant in Bulgaria situated 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) north of Sofia and 5 kilometres ( 3.1 mi ) east of Kozloduy , a town on the Danube river , near the border with Romania . It is the country 's only nuclear power plant and the largest in the region . The construction of the first reactor began on 6 April 1970 . Kozloduy NPP currently manages 2 pressurized water reactors with a total gross output of 2000 MWe and 1966 MW net . Units 5 and 6 , constructed in 1987 and 1991 respectively , are VVER-1000 reactors . By 2017 Unit 5 was to be upgraded to reach a capacity of 1,100 MWe , as part of a programme to extend the life of the unit by 30 years . A seventh 1,000 MW unit may be installed , using a part manufactured reactor from the terminated Belene project for which Bulgaria has paid \u20ac600m . The older and smaller Units 1 to 4 were all shut down by 2007 . Two spent fuel storage facilities are part of the power plant .",
  "/wiki/Kozloduy": "Kozloduy ( Bulgarian : \u041a\u043e\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0439 ) is a town of 13,771 inhabitants in northwest Bulgaria , located in Vratsa Province , on the Danube River . The city was liberated from Ottoman rule on 23 November 1877 by the Romanian Army under the command of the Imperial Russian Army . Kozloduy is best known for the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant , Bulgaria 's only ( as of January 2018 ) nuclear power plant , which is located nearby , as well as the second-largest Bulgarian Danubian island , Kozloduy Island . The city is also known for the ship Radetski , the boat in which the poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev and with 200 others crossed the Danube River in a final attempt to gather an army and liberate Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire .",
  "/wiki/VVER": "The water-water energetic reactor ( WWER ) , or VVER ( from Russian : \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e-\u0432\u043e\u0434\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 ; transliterates as vodo-vodyanoi energetichesky reaktor ; water-water power reactor ) is a series of pressurised water reactor designs originally developed in the Soviet Union , and now Russia , by OKB Gidropress . The idea of a reactor was proposed at the Kurchatov Institute by Savely Moiseevich Feinberg . VVER were originally developed before the 1970s , and have been continually updated . As a result , the name VVER is associated with a wide variety of reactor designs spanning from generation I reactors to modern generation III+ designs . Power output ranges from 70 to 1300 MWe , with designs of up to 1700 MWe in development . The first prototype VVER-210 was built at the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant . VVER power stations have been mostly installed in Russia and the former Soviet Union , but also in China , Finland , Germany , Hungary , Slovakia , Bulgaria , India , and Iran . Countries that are planning to introduce VVER reactors include Bangladesh , Egypt , Jordan , and Turkey .",
  "/wiki/Belene_Nuclear_Power_Plant": "The Belene Nuclear Power Plant ( Bulgarian : \u0410\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u201e \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435 ) is a planned nuclear power plant 3 km from Belene and 11 km from Svishtov in Pleven Province , northern Bulgaria , near the Danube River . It was intended to substitute four VVER-440 V230 reactors of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant that were decommissioned as a prerequisite for Bulgaria to join the European Union . On June 11 , 2010 , the Bulgarian government announced that it would freeze indefinitely the planned construction of the Belene nuclear power plant because it was uncertain when the investment would be returned . Five months later , on December 2 , a non-binding memorandum of understanding was signed between NEK EAD , Rosatom , Altran and Fortum , setting up a 6.3 bln . euro price on the power station , after months of unsuccessful talks on the cost and redeemability of the project itself . Further disagreement and the persistent demands of the Bulgarian government to lower the cost under 5.0 billion euro led to the termination of the project in March 2012 . However , in late 2012 the opposition initiated a referendum petition which was signed by 1,385,283 people and the first national referendum in the history of modern Bulgaria was held on January 27 , 2013 . A majority of the people had voted \u2032Yes ' to the construction of a new nuclear power plant , but despite that , the number of voters who attended the voting was too low for it to pass . The referendum passed the question further to the Parliament , which decided on 27 February 2013 to suspend it . Later on 30 May 2013 the newly elected Cabinet Prime Minister Oresharski announced there is a possible restart for it .",
  "/wiki/Belene": "Belene ( Bulgarian : \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435 ) is a town in Pleven Province , Northern Bulgaria . It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Belene Municipality . The town is situated on the right bank of the Danube river , close to the town of Svishtov . As of December 2009 , it has a population of 8,905 inhabitants . Belene was proclaimed a town in 1964 , which is celebrated every year in the first week of September with a market and cultural events . The place is best known for the Belene prison ( formerly a concentration camp ) on Belene Island where thousands of innocent Bulgarians found their deaths during the communist dictatorship , and as the proposed site of Bulgaria 's second nuclear power plant , which has been under construction 7 kilometres ( 4 miles ) east of the town . Although about 40% of construction worked and 80% of equipment deliveries for the first unit had been completed in 1991 , construction was suspended owing to a lack of financial resources . In 2002 , the Government decided to resume the Belene NPP Project and in 2005 , the Council of Ministers issued a decision for construction of two 1000 MW units . However , the Council of Ministers decision about the Belene NPP Project was subsequently suspended in 2012 . In 2018 , the Minister of Energy was assigned to again explore possibilities for construction of the Belene NPP . until it was interrupted in 1990 due to the severe economic crisis that followed the fall of communism in the country . There are plans to start construction again as a replacement for reactors 3 and 4 at Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant , which Bulgaria shut down as a condition for EU membership .",
