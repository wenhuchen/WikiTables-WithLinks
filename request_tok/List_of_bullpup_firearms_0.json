  "/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)": "A cartridge or a round is a type of pre-assembled firearm ammunition packaging a projectile ( bullet , shot , or slug ) , a propellant substance ( usually either smokeless powder or black powder ) and an ignition device ( primer ) within a metallic , paper or plastic case that is precisely made to fit within the barrel chamber of a breechloading gun , for the practical purpose of convenient transportation and handling during shooting . Although in popular usage the term bullet is often used to refer to a complete cartridge , it is correctly used only to refer to the projectile . Cartridges can be categorized by the type of their primers - a small charge of an impact- or electric-sensitive chemical mixture that is located at the center of the case head ( centerfire ) , inside the rim of the case base ( rimfire and the cupfire , now obsolete ) , in a sideway projection that is shaped like a pin ( pinfire , now obsolete ) or a lip ( lipfire , now obsolete ) , or in a small nipple-like bulge at the case base ( teat-fire , now obsolete ) . Military and commercial producers continue to pursue the goal of caseless ammunition . Some artillery ammunition uses the same cartridge concept as found in small arms . In other cases , the artillery shell is separate from the propellant charge . A cartridge without a projectile is called a blank . One that is completely inert ( contains no active primer and no propellant ) is called a dummy . One that failed to ignite and shoot off the projectile is called a dud , and one that ignited but failed to sufficiently push the projectile out of the barrel is called a squib .",
  "/wiki/A-91": "The A-91 is a bullpup assault rifle developed during the 1990s by KBP Instrument Design Bureau in Tula , Russia as an offspring of the 9A-91 firearm family . The A-91 retains the simple gas-operated , rotating bolt action and a trigger unit design from the 9A-91 , it features a bullpup polymer housing , with an integral 40 mm single-shot grenade launcher mounted under the barrel . The earliest prototypes of the A-91 bullpup were added with the grenade launcher above the barrel , and with a frontal vertical foregrip ; current models are fitted with the underbarrel launcher , which serves as a forearm . The A-91 has a forward ejection system , initially developed in Tula by designers like Afanasiev during the early 1960s . In this system , the ejection port is located right above the pistol grip , and is directed forward . Extracted cases go from bolt head through the short ejection tube to the ejection port , and fall out of the gun well clear of the shooter 's face , even when firing from the left shoulder . As for now , the A-91 is made in small numbers and , probably , is used by some elite police units in Russia ; it is also offered for export and domestic military and police sales .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

  "/wiki/9\u00d719mm_Parabellum": "The 9\u00d719mm Parabellum is a firearms cartridge that was designed by Georg Luger and introduced in 1902 by the German weapons manufacturer Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken ( DWM ) ( German Weapons and Munitions Factory ) for their Luger semi-automatic pistol . For this reason , it is designated as the 9mm Luger by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute ( SAAMI ) , and the 9 mm Luger by the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes \u00e0 Feu Portatives ( CIP ) . The name Parabellum is derived from the Latin : Si vis pacem , para bellum ( If you seek peace , prepare for war ) , which was the motto of DWM . Under STANAG 4090 , it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries . According to the 2014 edition of Cartridges of the World , the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum is the world 's most popular and widely used military handgun and submachine gun cartridge . In addition to being used by over 60% of police in the U.S. , Newsweek credits 9\u00d719mm Parabellum pistol sales with making semiautomatic pistols more popular than revolvers . The popularity of this cartridge can be attributed to the widely held conviction that it is effective in police and self-defense use . Its low cost and wide availability contribute to the caliber 's continuing popularity .",
  "/wiki/.45_ACP": "The .45 ACP ( Automatic Colt Pistol ) or .45 Auto ( 11.43\u00d723mm ) is a handgun cartridge designed by John Moses Browning in 1904 , for use in his prototype Colt semi-automatic pistol . After successful military trials , it was adopted as the standard chambering for Colt 's M1911 pistol.The round was developed due to a lack of stopping power experienced in the Moro Rebellion using the .38 Long Colt . This experience and the Thompson-LaGarde Tests of 1904 , led the Army and the Cavalry to decide a minimum of .45 caliber was required in a new handgun . The standard issue military .45 ACP round has a 230-grain bullet that travels at approximately 830 feet per second when fired from the government issue M1911A1 pistol . It operates at a relatively low maximum chamber pressure rating of 21,000 psi ( 145 MPa ) ( compared to 35,000 psi/241 MPa for 9mm Parabellum ) , which due to a low bolt thrust helps extend service life of weapons . Due to standard pressure .45 ACP rounds fired from handguns and submachine guns are inherently subsonic , and are useful in suppressed weapons to eliminate the sonic boom . Today , most NATO militaries use sidearms chambered for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge , but the effectiveness of the .45 ACP cartridge has ensured its continued popularity with large caliber sport shooters , especially in the United States . In 1985 , the .45 ACP M1911A1 pistol was replaced by the Beretta M9 9mm pistol as the main sidearm of the U.S. military , which in turn was replaced with the SIG Sauer P320 designated M17 for the full size and M18 for the compact .",

  "/wiki/Singapore": "Singapore ( /\u02c8s\u026a\u014b ( \u0261 ) \u0259p\u0254\u02d0r/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Singapore , is a sovereign city-state and island country in Southeast Asia . Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",

It should not be confused with the similarly named Russian 7.62\u00d754mmR cartridge , a slightly longer , rimmed cartridge . It was introduced in U.S. service in the M14 rifle and M60 machine gun in the late 1950s . The M14 was superseded in U.S. service as the infantry adopted the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO M16 rifle . However , the M14 and many other firearms that use the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO round remain in service , especially in the case of various marksman/sniper rifles , medium machine guns/general-purpose machine guns such as the M240 , and various rifles in use by special operations forces .

  "/wiki/.308_Winchester": "The .308 Winchester is a rimless , centerfire , bottlenecked rifle cartridge . During the 1940s , the .300 Savage became the basis for experiments on behalf of the U.S. Military that resulted in the development of the T65 series of experimental cartridges . The original experimental case design by the Frankford Arsenal was designated the T65 and was similar to the .300 Savage case , but with less taper . The experimental cases were made from standard .30-06 Springfield cases which gave a little less capacity than standard .300 Savage cases because the Frankford Arsenal cases had slightly thicker case walls . The later T65 iterations were lengthened compared to the original T65 case and provided a ballistic performance roughly equal to the U.S. military .30-06 Springfield service cartridge . Over forty years of technical progress in the field of propellants allowed for similar service cartridge performance from a significantly shorter , smaller case with less case capacity . Winchester saw a market for a civilian model of the late T65 series designs and introduced it in 1952 , two years prior to the NATO adoption of the T65E5 experimental cartridge iteration under the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO designation in 1954 . Winchester branded the cartridge and introduced it to the commercial hunting market as the .308 Winchester . Winchester 's Model 70 , Model 88 and Model 100 rifles were subsequently chambered for the new cartridge . Since then , the .308 Winchester has become the most popular short-action , big-game hunting cartridge worldwide . It is also commonly used for hunting , target shooting , metallic silhouette , bench rest target shooting , palma , metal matches , military sniping , and police sharpshooting . The relatively short case makes the .308 Winchester especially well-adapted for short-action rifles .",

The .300 Winchester Magnum is a magnum cartridge designed to fit in a standard rifle action . It is based on the .375 H & H Magnum , which has been blown out , shortened , and necked down to accept a .30 caliber ( 7.62 mm ) bullet .

The SVU was developed to meet the needs of the security forces of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs , such as OMON . The SVU was first seen in use in the First Chechen War . Originally , the plan was to just slightly modernize the aging SVD , but the designers eventually realised that the configuration of the weapon would have to be completely altered , leading to the creation of the SVU . A special muzzle brake was added that could absorb up to 40% of the recoil energy and an elastic butt stock with lamellar spring was non-rigidly attached to the receiver . The acoustics of the rifle were also improved by adding a sound suppressor . The other main improvements made to the SVU over the SVD include replacement of the butt stock , pistol grip , trigger and the mounting for the sight ; and shortening the barrel by 100 mm achieved perfect balance for the weapon . Around 1991 , the Russians developed a slight variant of the OTs-03 , the OTs-03A ( SVU-A ) . Whereas the SVU is semi-automatic , the SVU-A ( the A stands for automatic ) is a fully automatic rifle . In this rifle , the center of gravity was moved forward by the addition of a forward extended bipod mounted on the receiver . Developing 20 and 30 round magazines increased the capacity of the magazine so that it could be used effectively in full automatic mode ; and better optics were incorporated into the SVU-A to replace the previous units , which had been left almost untouched since the SVD . Though it has folding iron sights , the SVU is almost always used with the PSO-1 scope with illuminated reticle , but other Russian scopes can also be mounted .",

An innovative weapon with the compact bullpup layout and an optical sight , it used one of the early intermediate cartridges ( a concept introduced by the Germans with the 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz ) as a result of combat experience and German advances in weapons design during World War II . It used the experimental , intermediate powered , but highly efficient .280 British round , which was designed to replace the .303 round and Lee-Enfield rifle variants which had served since before the turn of the 20th century . The United States claimed the .280 British round was too weak for use in rifles and machine guns , and instead favoured the much more powerful 7.62\u00d751mm NATO round . As the EM-2 could not be easily adapted to the longer and more powerful round , it faded from use .
