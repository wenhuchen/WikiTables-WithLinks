  "/wiki/Chemist": "A chemist ( from Greek ch\u0113m ( \u00eda ) alchemy ; replacing chemist from Medieval Latin alchimista ) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry . Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties . Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities , with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms . Chemists carefully measure substance proportions , reaction rates , and other chemical properties . The word 'chemist ' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English . Chemists use this knowledge to learn the composition and properties of unfamiliar substances , as well as to reproduce and synthesize large quantities of useful naturally occurring substances and create new artificial substances and useful processes . Chemists may specialize in any number of subdisciplines of chemistry . Materials scientists and metallurgists share much of the same education and skills with chemists . The work of chemists is often related to the work of chemical engineers , who are primarily concerned with the proper design , construction and evaluation of the most cost-effective large-scale chemical plants and work closely with industrial chemists on the development of new processes and methods for the commercial-scale manufacture of chemicals and related products .",
  "/wiki/Stable_carbene": "A persistent carbene ( also known as stable carbene ) is a type of carbene demonstrating particular stability . The best-known examples and by far largest subgroup are the N-heterocyclic carbenes ( NHC ) ( sometimes called Arduengo carbenes ) , for example diaminocarbenes with the general formula ( R2N ) 2C : , where the ' R 's are typically alkyl and aryl groups . The groups can be linked to give heterocyclic carbenes , such as those derived from imidazole , imidazoline , thiazole or triazole . Traditionally carbenes are viewed as so reactive that were only studied indirectly , e.g . by trapping reactions . This situation has changed dramatically with the emergence of persistent carbenes . Although they are fairly reactive substances , i.e. , undergoing dimerization , many can be isolated as pure substances . Persistent carbenes can exist in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable . The relative stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups . Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically stable in the absence of moisture and ( in most cases ) oxygen , and can be isolated and indefinitely stored . Others dimerise slowly over days . Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds , and therefore can be observed but not stored .",

In 2018 , it was acquired by Bayer as part of its crop science division . It was headquartered in Creve Coeur , Missouri . Monsanto developed Roundup , a glyphosate-based herbicide , in the 1970s , and became a major producer of genetically engineered crops . Monsanto was one of four groups to introduce genes into plants in 1983 , and was among the first to conduct field trials of genetically modified crops in 1987 . It was one of the top 10 US chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002 , through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on biotechnology . Monsanto was one of the first companies to apply the biotechnology industry business model to agriculture , using techniques developed by biotech drug companies . :2-6 In this business model , companies recoup R & D expenses by exploiting biological patents . Monsanto 's roles in agricultural changes , biotechnology products , lobbying of government agencies , and roots as a chemical company , resulted in controversies . The company once manufactured controversial products such as the insecticide DDT , PCBs , Agent Orange , and recombinant bovine growth hormone . Its seed patenting model was criticized as biopiracy and a threat to biodiversity as invasive species . In September 2016 , Bayer announced its intent to acquire Monsanto for US $ 66 billion .",

  "/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction": "Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is a method widely used in molecular biology to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail . PCR was invented in 1983 by Kary Mullis . It is fundamental to much of genetic testing including analysis of ancient samples of DNA and identification of infectious agents . Using PCR , copies of very small amounts of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified in a series or cycles of temperature changes . PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical laboratory and clinical laboratory research for a broad variety of applications including biomedical research and criminal forensics . The vast majority of PCR methods rely on thermal cycling . Thermal cycling exposes reactants to repeated cycles of heating and cooling to permit different temperature-dependent reactions - specifically , DNA melting and enzyme-driven DNA replication . PCR employs two main reagents - primers ( which are short single strand DNA fragments known as oligonucleotides that are a complementary sequence to the target DNA region ) and a DNA polymerase . In the first step of PCR , the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called Nucleic acid denaturation . In the second step , the temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of DNA . The two DNA strands then become templates for DNA polymerase to enzymatically assemble a new DNA strand from free nucleotides , the building blocks of DNA . As PCR progresses , the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication , setting in motion a chain reaction in which the original DNA template is exponentially amplified .",
  "/wiki/Biochemistry": "Biochemistry , sometimes called biological chemistry , is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms . Biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life . A sub-discipline of both biology and chemistry , biochemistry can be divided in three fields ; structural biology , enzymology and metabolism . Over the last decades of the 20th century , biochemistry has through these three disciplines become successful at explaining living processes . Almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and research . Biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis which allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells , which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues , organs , and organism structure and function . Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology , the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena . Much of biochemistry deals with the structures , functions and interactions of biological macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates and lipids , which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life . The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions . These can be inorganic , for example water and metal ions , or organic , for example the amino acids , which are used to synthesize proteins . The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism .

DNA and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) are nucleic acids ; alongside proteins , lipids and complex carbohydrates ( polysaccharides ) , nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life . The two DNA strands are also known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides . Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases ( cytosine [ C ] , guanine [ G ] , adenine [ A ] or thymine [ T ] ) , a sugar called deoxyribose , and a phosphate group . The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next , resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone . The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together , according to base pairing rules ( A with T and C with G ) , with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA . The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups , pyrimidines and purines . In DNA , the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine ; the purines are adenine and guanine . Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information . This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate . A large part of DNA ( more than 98% for humans ) is non-coding , meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences . The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel .",

Some of its proponents reject the existence of HIV , while others accept that HIV exists but argue that it is a harmless passenger virus and not the cause of AIDS . Insofar as they acknowledge AIDS as a real disease , they attribute it to some combination of sexual behavior , recreational drugs , malnutrition , poor sanitation , haemophilia , or the effects of the medications used to treat HIV infection ( antiretrovirals ) . The scientific consensus is that the evidence showing HIV to be the cause of AIDS is conclusive and that HIV/AIDS denialist claims are pseudoscience based on conspiracy theories , faulty reasoning , cherry picking , and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data . With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community , HIV/AIDS denialist material is now targeted at less scientifically sophisticated audiences and spread mainly through the Internet . Despite its lack of scientific acceptance , HIV/AIDS denialism has had a significant political impact , especially in South Africa under the presidency of Thabo Mbeki . Scientists and physicians have raised alarm at the human cost of HIV/AIDS denialism , which discourages HIV-positive people from using proven treatments . Public health researchers have attributed 330,000 to 340,000 AIDS-related deaths , along with 171,000 other HIV infections and 35,000 infant HIV infections , to the South African government 's former embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism . The interrupted use of antiretroviral treatments is also a major global concern as it potentially increases the likelihood of the emergence of antiretroviral-resistant strains of the virus .",
