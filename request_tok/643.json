  "/wiki/Bicycle": "A bicycle , also called a bike or cycle , is a human-powered or motor-powered , pedal-driven , single-track vehicle , having two wheels attached to a frame , one behind the other . A bicycle rider is called a cyclist , or bicyclist . Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe , and by the early 21st century , more than 1 billion were in existence at a given time . These numbers far exceed the number of cars , both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced . They are the principal means of transportation in many regions . They also provide a popular form of recreation , and have been adapted for use as children 's toys , general fitness , military and police applications , courier services , bicycle racing , and bicycle stunts . The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or safety bicycle , has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885 . However , many details have been improved , especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design . These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling . The bicycle 's invention has had an enormous effect on society , both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods . Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle , including ball bearings , pneumatic tires , chain-driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels .",
  "/wiki/Newspaper": "A newspaper is a periodical publication containing written information about current events and is often typed in black ink with a white or gray background . Newspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as politics , business , sports and art , and often include materials such as opinion columns , weather forecasts , reviews of local services , obituaries , birth notices , crosswords , editorial cartoons , comic strips , and advice columns . Most newspapers are businesses , and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription revenue , newsstand sales , and advertising revenue . The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers . Newspapers have traditionally been published in print ( usually on cheap , low-grade paper called newsprint ) . However , today most newspapers are also published on websites as online newspapers , and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely . Newspapers developed in the 17th century , as information sheets for merchants . By the early 19th century , many cities in Europe , as well as North and South America , published newspapers . Some newspapers with high editorial independence , high journalism quality , and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record .",
  "/wiki/Vandalism": "Vandalism is the action involving deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private property . The definition of vandalism allows to distinguish hostile behavior aimed to damage or destroy the object , instrumental behavior consisting of damage or destruction caused to an object as a mean to achieve other goals ( appropriation of anothers property , sabotage ) , and behavior motivated by a desire to express oneself through the degradation of objects as well as a play vandalism ( breaking window panes ) . The term includes property damage , such as graffiti and defacement directed towards any property without permission of the owner . The term finds its roots in an Enlightenment view that the Germanic Vandals were a uniquely destructive people .",
  "/wiki/Raster_graphics": "In computer graphics , a raster graphics or bitmap image is a dot matrix data structure that represents a generally rectangular grid of pixels ( points of color ) , viewable via a monitor , paper , or other display medium . Raster images are stored in image files with varying formats . A bitmap is a rectangular grid of pixels , with each pixel 's color being specified by a number of bits . A bitmap might be created for storage in the display 's video memory or as a device-independent bitmap file . A raster is technically characterized by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel ( or color depth , which determines the number of colors it can represent ) . The printing and prepress industries know raster graphics as contones ( from continuous tones ) . The opposite to contones is line work , usually implemented as vector graphics in digital systems . Vector images can be rasterized ( converted into pixels ) , and raster images vectorized ( raster images converted into vector graphics ) , by software . In both cases some information is lost , although vectorizing can also restore some information back to machine readability , as happens in optical character recognition .",

  "/wiki/Pinball": "Pinball is a type of arcade game , in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more metallic balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine . The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible . Many modern pinball machines include a storyline where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story , usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game . Different numbers of points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field . A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field , partially protected by player-controlled paddles called flippers . A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times . Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing ( by earning extra balls and keeping the ball in play as long as possible ) , and to earn bonus credits by achieving a high enough score or through other means .",

The graphical animations for the player character and opponents were created through a bluescreen process , where the various poses and moves were performed by real actors in front of a video camera . The game 's on-screen character animation are replays of the actual footage , not a rotoscoped ( redrawn ) animation as is common in other games . Pit-Fighter is the second fighting game to use digitized sprites , after Home Data 's Reikai D\u014dshi : Chinese Exorcist .",

  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter .",

  "/wiki/Table_tennis": "Table tennis , also known as ping-pong , is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small rackets . The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net . Except for the initial serve , the rules are generally as follows : players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table , and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once . A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules . Play is fast and demands quick reactions . Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent 's options , giving the hitter a great advantage . Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation ( ITTF ) , founded in 1926 . ITTF currently includes 226 member associations . The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook . Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988 , with several event categories . From 1988 until 2004 , these were men 's singles , women 's singles , men 's doubles and women 's doubles . Since 2008 , a team event has been played instead of the doubles .",

  "/wiki/Dinosaur": "Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles [ note 1 ] of the clade Dinosauria . They first appeared during the Triassic period , between 243 and 233.23 million years ago , although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research . They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago ; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods . The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs , having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch . As such , birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago . Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs , or birds ; and non-avian dinosaurs , which are all dinosaurs other than birds . Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic , morphological and ecological standpoints . Birds , at over 10,000 living species , are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish . Using fossil evidence , paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs . Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species ( birds ) and fossil remains . Through the first half of the 20th century , before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs , most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded . Most research conducted since the 1970s , however , has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction .",

  "/wiki/Prototype": "A prototype is an early sample , model , or release of a product built to test a concept or process . It is a term used in a variety of contexts , including semantics , design , electronics , and software programming . A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users . Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real , working system rather than a theoretical one . In some design workflow models , creating a prototype ( a process sometimes called materialization ) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea . A prototype can also mean a typical example of something such as in the use of the derivation 'prototypical ' . This is a useful term in identifying objects , behaviours and concepts which are considered the accepted norm and is analogous with terms such as stereotypes and archetypes . The word prototype derives from the Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd prototypon , primitive form , neutral of \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 prototypos , original , primitive , from \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 protos , first and \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 typos , impression .",

  "/wiki/Biplane": "A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other . The first powered , controlled aeroplane to fly , the Wright Flyer , used a biplane wing arrangement , as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation . While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane , it produces more drag than a monoplane wing . Improved structural techniques , better materials and higher speeds made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s . Biplanes offer several advantages over conventional cantilever monoplane designs : they permit lighter wing structures , low wing loading and smaller span for a given wing area . However , interference between the airflow over each wing increases drag substantially , and biplanes generally need extensive bracing , which causes additional drag . Biplanes are distinguished from tandem wing arrangements , where the wings are placed forward and aft , instead of above and below . The term is also occasionally used in biology , to describe the wings of some flying animals .",
  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan ."
