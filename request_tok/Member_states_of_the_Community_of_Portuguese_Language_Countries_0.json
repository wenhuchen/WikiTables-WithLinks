It is the westernmost sovereign state of mainland Europe , being bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain . Its territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira , both autonomous regions with their own regional governments . Portugal is the oldest nation state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe and the world , its territory having been continuously settled , invaded and fought over since prehistoric times . The pre-Celtic people , Iberians , Celts , Carthaginians and Romans were followed by the invasions of the Visigoths and Suebi Germanic peoples . After the Muslim conquests of the Iberian Peninsula , most of the territory was part of Al-Andalus until their expulsion . Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian Reconquista . Founded in 868 , the County of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede in 1128 . The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique in 1139 , and independence from Le\u00f3n was recognised by the Treaty of Zamora in 1143 . On 12 December 2017 , the Portuguese Navy commemorated the 700th anniversary of its official creation by King Denis of Portugal . Tracing its origins back to the 12th century , it is the oldest continuously serving navy in the world . In the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal established the first global empire , becoming one of the world 's major economic , political and military powers .",

It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",

Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro .

It is the seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",

The sovereign state is separated from the Comoros , Mayotte and Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east . The capital and largest city of Mozambique is Maputo ( formerly known as Louren\u00e7o Marques from 1876 to 1976 ) . Between the first and fifth centuries AD , Bantu-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique from farther north and west . Northern Mozambique lies within the monsoon trade winds of the Indian Ocean . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , a series of Swahili port towns developed here , which contributed to the development of a distinct Swahili culture and language . In the late medieval period , these towns were frequented by traders from Somalia , Ethiopia , Egypt , Arabia , Persia , and India . The voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498 marked the arrival of the Portuguese , who began a gradual process of colonisation and settlement in 1505 . After over four centuries of Portuguese rule , Mozambique gained independence in 1975 , becoming the People 's Republic of Mozambique shortly thereafter . After only two years of independence , the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992 . In 1994 , Mozambique held its first multiparty elections , and has since remained a relatively stable presidential republic , although it still faces a low-intensity insurgency .

It forms part of the Macaronesia ecoregion , along with the Azores , Canary Islands , Madeira , and the Savage Isles . Located 570 kilometres ( 350 mi ) west of the Cape Verde Peninsula off the coast of Northwest Africa , the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres ( 1,500 sq mi ) . The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century , when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands , establishing the first European settlement in the tropics . Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade , the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries , attracting merchants , privateers , and pirates . The end of transatlantic slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration . Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes . Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951 , the islands continued to campaign for independence , which was achieved in 1975 . Since the early 1990s , Cape Verde has been a stable representative democracy , and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa . Lacking natural resources , its developing economy is mostly service-oriented , with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment . Its population of around 540,000 is mostly of mixed European , Moorish , Arab and African heritage , and predominantly Roman Catholic , reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule .

A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",
  "/wiki/French_language": "French ( le fran\u00e7ais [ l\u0259 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b ] or la langue fran\u00e7aise [ la l\u0251\u0303\u0261 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z ] ) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family . It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania . French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union . Of Europeans who speak other languages natively , approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language ."
