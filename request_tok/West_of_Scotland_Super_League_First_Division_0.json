It is the tenth most-populous locality in Scotland and the most populated town in north Lanarkshire , positioned in the centre of Scotland 's Central Belt . Geographically , Cumbernauld sits between east and west , being on the Scottish watershed between the Forth and the Clyde ; however , it is culturally far more weighted towards Glasgow and the New Town 's planners thought to fill 80% of its houses from Scotland 's largest city to reduce housing pressure there . Cumbernauld was marked by the Romans in antiquity . Traces of this are still visible today for example at Westerwood and , less conspicuously , north of the M80 where the legionaries surfaced what would later be called the Auld Cley Road . This is acknowledged in Cumbernauld Community Park , also site of Scotland 's only visible open-air Roman altar , in the shadow of the imposing Carrickstone Water Tower . For many years Cumbernauld was chiefly populated around what is now called The Village with the medieval castle a short walk away surrounded by its own park grounds . The castle frequently hosted visiting royalty and the grounds were famous for their white cattle which were hunted in the oak forest . The town began to spread as the weaving industry of the village was supplemented by mining and quarrying as travel across Scotland became easier due to the Forth and Clyde Canal and the railways being constructed . Cumbernauld railway station , though some distance from the village , improved communications with Glasgow , Falkirk and Stirling . Cumbernauld was designated as the site for a New Town on 9 December 1955 .

As the county town , Renfrew once was a centre of local government for the surrounding area . Whilst the county remained known as Renfrewshire , the focus of local government gradually shifted from Renfrew to its larger neighbour Paisley . Following the reorganisation of 1996 , Renfrewshire was divided for local government purposes into three modern council areas : Renfrewshire , with considerably smaller boundaries than the old county , including Renfrew and with its administrative centre at Paisley ; Inverclyde with its centre at Greenock , covering the western part of the county ; and East Renfrewshire , with its centre at Giffnock . The boundaries of the historic County of Renfrew remain for a number of ceremonial and administrative purposes . The House of Stewart was previously based out of the former Renfrew Castle . In 1164 , it was the site of the Battle of Renfrew , a decisive victory for the Scottish crown over Somerled , Lord of the Isles . Given its link to the monarchy and the victory at Renfrew , the heir to the British throne holds the title of Baron Renfrew and Lord of the Isles , the current holder being Prince Charles , Duke of Rothesay .

On the park , the greatest era in the club 's history was the mid- to late 1950s . In 1956 the club played in front of 20,100 people at Shawfield Stadium in the semi final of the Scottish Junior Cup , only to lose 3-2 to eventual winners Petershill . However , in 1957-58 the Club won the Western League ( South ) Championship , losing out to North Champions Irvine Meadow in the play-off to determine the destination of the league championship itself . Since then the club has had , in the main , a troubled time , with its very existence called into question on a number of occasions . However , in recent years , developments on and off the park have placed the club on a more secure foundation . In 2017-18 the Club won promotion to the newly formed Championship and in 2018 formed its own charity , Vics in the Community , providing free coaching to local youngsters and starting the development of a youth player pathway . In 2017 , the Club formed an Amateur side that won promotion to the Ayrshire First Division in only its second season and are also in the process of developing other recreational forms of the game , such as an Over 35 's team .",

On the southern bank of the River Ayr sits the ramparts of a citadel constructed by Oliver Cromwell 's men during the mid-17th century . Towards the south of the town is the birthplace of Scottish poet Robert Burns in the suburb of Alloway . Ayr has been a popular tourist resort since the expansion of the railway in 1840 owing to the town 's fine beach and its links to golfing and Robert Burns .
