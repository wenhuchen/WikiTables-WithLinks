  "/wiki/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016": "The 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump was formally launched on June 16 , 2015 , at Trump Tower in New York City . Trump was the Republican nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election , having won the most state primaries , caucuses , and delegates at the 2016 Republican National Convention . He chose Mike Pence , the sitting Governor of Indiana , as his vice presidential running mate . On November 8 , 2016 , Trump and Pence were elected president and vice president of the United States . Trump 's populist positions in opposition to illegal immigration and various trade agreements , such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership , earned him support especially among voters who were male , white , blue-collar , working class , and those without college degrees . Many of Trump 's remarks were controversial and helped his campaign garner extensive coverage by the mainstream media , trending topics , and social media . Trump 's campaign rallies attracted large crowds , as well as public controversy . Some of the events were marked by incidents of violence between Trump supporters and protesters , mistreatment of some journalists , and disruption by a large group of protesters who effectively shut down a major rally in Chicago . Trump himself was accused of inciting violence at his rallies . Trump 's disdain for political correctness was a staple theme of his campaign and proved popular among his supporters . Many , including some mainstream commentators and some prominent Republicans , viewed him as appealing to racism , a charge that Trump has repeatedly denied . Trump 's most polarizing and widely reported proposals were about issues of immigration and border security , especially his proposed deportation of all illegal immigrants , the proposed construction of a substantial wall on the Mexico-United States border at Mexican expense , his characterizations of many illegal Mexican immigrants as criminals , drug dealers , rapists , etc , and a temporary ban on foreign Muslims entering the U.S. ( which he later modified to apply to people originating from countries which he described as having a history of terrorism against the United States or its allies ) .",

He was a planter and owner of the Snowden plantation that he inherited from his father . He served the local militia for about ten years , making Captain of the local militia in 1794 . He also served during the Revolutionary War . Randolph , known as Uncle Randolph when he visited Monticello , was considered as a candidate for the father of Sally Hemings ' children following DNA studies that found that the Hemings children descended from the Jefferson line . The theory that Randolph Jefferson fathered Hemings children was discounted by the fact that Randolph did not visit Monticello often and , according to Monticello records , did not visit the plantation during the periods in which Hemings ' children would have been conceived . He often socialized with the slaves during his visits . His son , Isham Randolph Jefferson , who lived at Monticello during his childhood is another alternate candidate for Hemings children 's paternity .

  "/wiki/Lloyd's_of_London": "Lloyd 's of London , generally known simply as Lloyd 's , is an insurance and reinsurance market located in London , United Kingdom . Unlike most of its competitors in the industry , it is not an insurance company ; rather , Lloyd 's is a corporate body governed by the Lloyd 's Act 1871 and subsequent Acts of Parliament and operates as a partially-mutualised marketplace within which multiple financial backers , grouped in syndicates , come together to pool and spread risk . These underwriters , or members , are a collection of both corporations and private individuals , the latter being traditionally known as Names . The business underwritten at Lloyd 's is predominantly general insurance and reinsurance , although a small number of syndicates write term life assurance . The market has its roots in marine insurance and was founded by Edward Lloyd at his coffee house on Tower Street in c. 1686 . Today , it has a dedicated building on Lime Street within which business is transacted at each syndicate 's box in the underwriting Room , with the insurance policy documentation being known traditionally as a slip . The market 's motto is Fidentia , Latin for confidence , and it is closely associated with the Latin phrase uberrima fides , or utmost good faith , representing the relationship between underwriters and brokers . Having survived multiple scandals and significant challenges through the second half of the 20th century , most notably the asbestosis affair , Lloyd 's today promotes its strong financial chain of security available to promptly pay all valid claims . At the end of 2018 [ update ] , this chain consisted of \u00a353.5 billion of syndicate-level assets ; \u00a326.5bn of members ' funds at Lloyd 's ; over \u00a33.2bn in a third mutual link which includes the Central Fund , plus a \u00a30.9bn callable layer . In 2018 there were 84 syndicates managed by 55 managing agencies that collectively wrote \u00a335.5bn of gross premiums on risks placed by 303 approved brokers .

Direct insurance represented around 70 per cent of the premiums , mainly covering property and casualty ( liability ) , while the remaining 30 per cent was reinsurance .",
  "/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks": "The September 11 attacks ( also referred to as 9/11 ) [ a ] were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda against the United States on the morning of Tuesday , September 11 , 2001 . The attacks resulted in 2,977 victim fatalities , over 25,000 injuries , and caused at least $ 10 billion in infrastructure and property damage . Additional people have died of 9/11-related cancer and respiratory diseases in the months and years following the attacks . Four passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers ( United Airlines and American Airlines ) - all of which departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for San Francisco and Los Angeles - were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists . Two of the planes , American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers , respectively , of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan . Within an hour and 42 minutes , both 110-story towers collapsed . Debris and the resulting fires caused a partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex , including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower , as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures . A third plane , American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon ( the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense ) in Arlington County , Virginia , which led to a partial collapse of the building 's west side . The fourth plane , United Airlines Flight 93 , was initially flown toward Washington , D.C. , but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , after its passengers thwarted the hijackers . 9/11 is the single deadliest terrorist attack in human history and the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States , with 343 and 72 killed , respectively . Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda . The United States responded by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban , which had failed to comply with U.S. demands to extradite Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan .",

At the time of their completion , the Twin Towers - the original 1 World Trade Center , at 1,368 feet ( 417 m ) ; and 2 World Trade Center , at 1,362 feet ( 415.1 m ) - were the tallest buildings in the world . Other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center ( 3 WTC ) , 4 WTC , 5 WTC , 6 WTC , and 7 WTC . The complex contained 13,400,000 square feet ( 1,240,000 m2 ) of office space .

During its existence , the World Trade Center experienced several major incidents , including a fire on February 13 , 1975 , a bombing on February 26 , 1993 , and a bank robbery on January 14 , 1998 . In 1998 , the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey decided to privatize it by leasing the buildings to a private company to manage . It awarded the lease to Silverstein Properties in July 2001 . On the morning of September 11 , 2001 , Al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the North and South Towers within minutes of each other ; two hours later , both towers collapsed . The attacks killed 2,606 people in and within the vicinity of the towers , as well as all 157 on board the two aircraft . Falling debris from the towers , combined with fires that the debris initiated in several surrounding buildings , led to the partial or complete collapse of all the buildings in the complex , and caused catastrophic damage to ten other large structures in the surrounding area .",

  "/wiki/The_Internet": "The Internet ( portmanteau of interconnected network ) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) to link devices worldwide . It is a network of networks that consists of private , public , academic , business , and government networks of local to global scope , linked by a broad array of electronic , wireless , and optical networking technologies . The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services , such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web ( WWW ) , electronic mail , telephony , and file sharing . The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to build robust , fault-tolerant communication with computer networks . The primary precursor network , the ARPANET , initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s . The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s , as well as private funding for other commercial extensions , led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies , and the merger of many networks . The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet , and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional , personal , and mobile computers were connected to the network . Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s , commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life . Most traditional communication media , including telephony , radio , television , paper mail and newspapers are reshaped , redefined , or even bypassed by the Internet , giving birth to new services such as email , Internet telephony , Internet television , online music , digital newspapers , and video streaming websites . Newspaper , book , and other print publishing are adapting to website technology , or are reshaped into blogging , web feeds and online news aggregators . The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging , Internet forums , and social networking . Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs , as it enables firms to extend their brick and mortar presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online .",
