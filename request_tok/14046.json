  "/wiki/Ravenloft_(module)": "Ravenloft is an adventure module for the Dungeons & Dragons ( D & D ) fantasy role-playing game . The American game publishing company TSR , Inc. released it as a standalone adventure booklet in 1983 for use with the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game . It was written by Tracy and Laura Hickman , and includes art by Clyde Caldwell with maps by David Sutherland III . The plot of Ravenloft focuses on the villain Strahd von Zarovich , a vampire who pines for his lost love . Various story elements , including Strahd 's motivation and the locations of magical weapons , are randomly determined by drawing cards . The player characters attempt to defeat Strahd and , if successful , the adventure ends . The Hickmans began work on Ravenloft in the late 1970s , intent on creating a frightening portrait of a vampire in a setting that combined Gothic horror with the D & D game system . They play-tested the adventure with a group of players each Halloween for five years before it was published . Strahd has since appeared in a number of D & D accessories and novels . The module has inspired numerous revisions and adaptations , including a campaign setting of the same name and a sequel . In 1999 , on the 25th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons , two commemorative versions of Ravenloft were released . Ravenloft has won one award , been included on two best of lists , and was generally well received by critics of its era .",
