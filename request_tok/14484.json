  "/wiki/New_York_Central_1290_and_1291": "The New York Central Railroad 's 1290 and 1291 were a pair of Canadian F-82 4-6-0 Ten-Wheelers . They were built in July and November 1900 by the Canada Southern Railway in the company 's St. Thomas , Ontario shops . Costing $ 18,537.82 each , they originally received the numbers 449 and 454 . Four years later , the railroad was leased to the Michigan Central Railroad for 99 years , and the two locomotives were renumbered to 8152 and 8153 in 1905 . In 1929 , the railroad was subleased to the New York Central , where it became its St. Clair Subdivision . During this time , the two steam engines were principally used on the St. Clair Subdivision , along with the Fort Erie and Niagara Falls branch lines . The locomotives were renumbered again in 1936 , to 880 and 881 . This lasted 12 years before they were renumbered a final time , to 1290 and 1291 . Despite the great purging of steam-powered engines on the Central in the 1950s , 1290 and 1291 were not immediately replaced . They ran on the Courtright branch line for the last part of their lives , as its track and bridges - running for 62 miles ( 100 km ) between Courtright and St. Clair Junction , near St. Thomas - had deteriorated by the end of the 40s and could no longer handle newer ( and heavier ) motive power . By 1955 , they were two of only 44 steam locomotives left running on the entire New York Central system . At some point in their later careers , water towers were removed from along the line ; for all runs after , 1290 and 1291 ran with an auxiliary water tender behind the normal tender .",

  "/wiki/Centralized_traffic_control": "Centralized traffic control ( CTC ) is a form of railway signalling that originated in North America . CTC consolidates train routing decisions that were previously carried out by local signal operators or the train crews themselves . The system consists of a centralized train dispatcher 's office that controls railroad interlockings and traffic flows in portions of the rail system designated as CTC territory . One hallmark of CTC is a control panel with a graphical depiction of the railroad . On this panel , the dispatcher can keep track of trains ' locations across the territory that the dispatcher controls . Larger railroads may have multiple dispatcher 's offices and even multiple dispatchers for each operating division . These offices are usually located near the busiest yards or stations , and their operational qualities can be compared to air traffic towers .",

  "/wiki/Caboose": "A caboose is a manned North American railroad car coupled at the end of a freight train . Cabooses provide shelter for crew at the end of a train , formerly required in switching and shunting , keeping a lookout for load shifting , damage to equipment and cargo , and overheating axles . Originally flatcars fitted with cabins or modified box cars , they later became purpose-built with projections above or to the sides of the car to allow crew to observe the train from shelter . The caboose also served as the conductor 's office , and on long routes included accommodation and cooking facilities . A similar railroad car design , the brake van , was used on British and Commonwealth railways ( the role has since been replaced by the crew car in Australia ) . These provided the additional function of serving as a supplemental braking system for trains not fitted with a continuous braking system , and keeping chain couplings taut . Cabooses were used on every freight train in the United States until the 1980s , when safety laws requiring the presence of cabooses and full crews were relaxed . Developments in monitoring and safety technology such as lineside defect detectors and end-of-train devices resulted in crew reductions and the phasing out of caboose cars . Nowadays , they are generally only used on rail maintenance or hazardous materials trains , or on heritage and tourist railroads .",

They are divided into three categories : dumb units , which only provide a visible indication of the rear of the train with a flashing red taillight ; average intelligence units with a brake pipe pressure gauge ; and smart units , which send back data to the crew in the locomotive via radio-based telemetry . They originated in North America , and are also used elsewhere in the world , where they may include complete End of Train Air System ( ETAS ) or Sense and Brake Unit ( SBU ) devices .",
