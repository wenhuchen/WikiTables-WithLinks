It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic . To its south-west lies the small island of Navassa Island , which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration . Haiti is 27,750 square kilometers ( 10,714 sq mi ) in size and has an estimated population of 11.1 million , making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Cuba . The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , who migrated from South America . The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue . French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations , worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa , which made the colony one of the richest in the world . In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789-99 ) , slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture . After 12 years of conflict , Napoleon Bonaparte 's forces were defeated by Louverture 's successor , Jean-Jacques Dessalines ( later Emperor Jacques I ) , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty on 1 January 1804 - the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the first country to abolish slavery , and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt .",

He held world championships in two weight classes , including the unified WBA ( Super ) , WBC , IBF , WBO , Ring magazine and lineal super-middleweight titles , and the Ring light-heavyweight title . Calzaghe is the longest-reigning super-middleweight world champion in boxing history , having held the WBO title for over 10 years and making 21 successful defences ( the most in super-middleweight history ) before moving up to light-heavyweight .

He was also the first boxer to unify three of the four major world titles ( WBA , WBC , and WBO ) at super-middleweight , and was the first Ring champion in that weight class . Between 2006 and 2008 , Calzaghe was ranked by The Ring as one of the world 's top ten active boxers , pound for pound , reaching a peak ranking of third in January 2009 . He retired in February 2009 with an undefeated record , and as a reigning world champion . BoxRec currently ranks Calzaghe as the best super-middleweight of all time . Calzaghe was often referred to as the Pride of Wales or the Italian Dragon , the latter being a play on the moniker Italian Stallion and a reference to his multiple heritages ( the dragon being both a prominent Welsh emblem that appears on the Welsh flag and a figure in Sardinian myth ) . In 2007 , Calzaghe won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award , making him the first Welsh winner of this award since David Broome in 1960 .
