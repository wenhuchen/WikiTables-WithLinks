Previous bassist Alec John Such was dismissed in 1994 , and longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora left in 2013 . In 1984 and 1985 , Bon Jovi released their first two albums and their debut single Runaway managed to crack the Top 40 . In 1986 , the band achieved widespread success and global recognition with their third album , Slippery When Wet , which sold over 20 million copies and included three Top 10 singles , two of which reached No . 1 ( You Give Love a Bad Name and Livin ' on a Prayer ) Their fourth album , New Jersey ( 1988 ) , was also very successful , selling over 10 million copies and featuring five Top 10 singles ( a record for a hard rock album ) , two of which reached No . 1 ( Bad Medicine and I 'll Be There for You ) .

In 1992 , the band returned with the double-platinum Keep the Faith . This was followed by their biggest-selling and longest-charting single Always ( 1994 ) and the album These Days ( 1995 ) , which proved to be a bigger hit in Europe than in the United States , producing four Top Ten singles in the United Kingdom . Following a second hiatus , their 2000 album Crush , particularly the lead single , It 's My Life , successfully introduced the band to a younger audience . The band followed up with Bounce in 2002 .",

  "/wiki/Hard_rock": "Hard rock , a loosely-defined subgenre of rock music , began in the mid-1960s with the garage , psychedelic and blues rock movements . It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals , distorted electric guitars , bass guitar , and drums , often accompanied with keyboards . Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s , with bands such as the Who , Boston , Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple , Aerosmith , Kiss , Queen , AC/DC and Van Halen . During the 1980s , some hard-rock bands moved away from their hard-rock roots and more towards pop rock , Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and hard rock reached a commercial peak in the 1980s , with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi , and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N ' Roses , which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade . Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of R & B , hip-hop , urban pop , grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s . Despite this , many post-grunge bands adopted a hard-rock sound , and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands , attempts at a revival , and new hard-rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes . Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes , the Strokes , Interpol and , later on , the Black Keys . In the 2000s only a few hard-rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers .",
  "/wiki/Glam_metal": "Glam metal ( often used synonymously with pop metal , or pejoratively as hair metal ) is a subgenre of heavy metal , which features pop-influenced hooks and guitar riffs , and borrows heavily from the fashion and image of 1970s glam rock . Early glam metal evolved directly from the glam rock movement of the 1970s , as visual elements taken from acts such as The New York Dolls and David Bowie ( and to a lesser extent , the punk and new wave movements taking place concurrently in New York City ) were fused with the decidedly more heavy metal leaning and theatrical acts such as Alice Cooper and Kiss . The first examples of this fusion began appearing in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States , particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene , pioneered by bands such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce , Ratt , Quiet Riot , Twisted Sister , Stryper , Def Leppard , Bon Jovi , and Dokken . It achieved huge commercial success from approximately 1983 until the early 1990s , bringing to prominence bands such as Poison , Skid Row , Cinderella and Warrant . From a strictly visual perspective , glam metal is defined by flashy and tight fitting clothing , makeup , and an overall androgynous aesthetic in which the traditional denim & leather aspect of heavy metal culture is replaced by lace and heavy use of the color pink . Glam metal suffered a big loss in popularity beginning by the early 1990s as the grunge and alternative phenomenon revolutionized hard rock , and fans ' tastes moved toward a more natural and stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style . During this period , many of the most successful acts of the genre 's 1980s pinnacle suddenly found themselves facing disbandment as their audiences moved in another direction . Glam metal has experienced a resurgence since the early 2000s , with successful reunion tours of many popular acts from the genre 's 1980s heyday , as well as the emergence of new , predominantly European bands , including the Darkness , Santa Cruz , Reckless Love , The Struts , and Steel Panther .",

Referred to as the Songbird Supreme by the Guinness World Records , she is noted for her five-octave vocal range , melismatic singing style , signature use of the whistle register , and songwriting prowess . She rose to fame in 1990 after signing to Columbia Records and releasing her eponymous debut album , which topped the U.S . Billboard 200 for eleven consecutive weeks . Soon after , Carey became the only artist ever to have their first five singles reach number one on the U.S . Billboard Hot 100 chart , from Vision of Love to Emotions . Carey achieved worldwide success with follow-up R & B and pop albums Music Box ( 1993 ) , Merry Christmas ( 1994 ) , and Daydream ( 1995 ) . These albums spawned some of Carey 's most successful singles , including Hero , Without You , All I Want for Christmas Is You , Fantasy , Always Be My Baby , as well as One Sweet Day , which later became Billboard 's Song Of The Decade ( 1990s ) . After separating from Mottola , Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of hip hop into her music with the release of Butterfly ( 1997 ) . Billboard named her the country 's most successful artist of the 1990s , while the World Music Awards honored her as the world 's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s , and the best-selling female artist of the millennium . After eleven consecutive years charting a U.S. number-one single , Carey parted ways with Columbia in 2000 and signed a $ 100 million recording contract with Virgin Records . However , following her highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown , as well as the critical and commercial failure of her film Glitter ( 2001 ) and its accompanying soundtrack , her contract was bought out for $ 50 million by Virgin and she signed with Island Records the next year .",
  "/wiki/Music_Box_(Mariah_Carey_album)": "Music Box is the third studio album by American singer Mariah Carey . It was released by Columbia Records on August 31 , 1993 , in North America . The album comprises ballads primarily co-written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff , with whom she had previously worked on Emotions ( 1991 ) , and a few urban dance tracks . During the course of the album 's development , Carey wanted to broaden her audience , choosing a more pop/R & B oriented sound . During this time frame , she experimented with different musical instruments , leading the album 's sound away from her more contemporary previous two efforts . Two unused tracks from the album sessions were released as B-sides : Do You Think of Me and Everything Fades Away . In order to successfully take the album in a new direction , Carey and Afanasieff sought out new and innovative producers , as well as some from Carey 's previous releases . Kenneth Babyface Edmonds first began working with Carey on Music Box , where he helped produce some of the album 's softer and more melodious tracks , as well as being part of the songwriting process . Additional writers and producers were Robert Clivill\u00e9s and David Cole ( a pair also known as C+C Music Factory ) and Daryl Simmons . While the album featured a range of music producers , the bulk of the songwriting was done by Carey and her writing partner , Walter Afanasieff . In future projects , they would continue writing material for Carey 's albums , until her 1999 release Rainbow , where he is absent from the writing credits . Four singles were released from the album .",
  "/wiki/Pop_music": "Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern forms in the US and the UK during the mid-1950s . The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably , although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many diverse styles . Pop and rock were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s , when they became quite separated from each other . Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music , the genre is distinguished from chart music . Pop music often borrows elements from other styles such as urban , dance , rock , Latin , and country ; nevertheless , there are many key elements that define pop music . Identifying factors usually include short to medium-length songs written in a basic format , also known as perrypoetry ( often the verse-chorus structure ) , as well as common use of repeated choruses , melodic tunes and hooks .",

Electronic influences are becoming an increasing trend and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical , although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out . Contemporary R & B vocalists are often known for their use of melisma , popularized by vocalists such as Michael Jackson , R. Kelly , Craig David , Stevie Wonder , Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey .

Referred to as the Queen of Pop since the 1980s , Madonna is known for pushing the boundaries of songwriting in mainstream popular music and for the imagery she uses onstage and in music videos . She has frequently reinvented her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the recording industry . Her works have been praised by music critics and have sparked controversy . Madonna is often cited as an influence by other artists . Born and raised in Michigan , Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance . After performing as a drummer , guitarist , and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy , Madonna signed with Sire Records in 1982 and released her eponymous debut album the next year .

True Blue deals with her visions of love , work , dreams as well as disappointments , and was inspired by her then husband Sean Penn , to whom Madonna dedicated the album . Musically , the songs on the album took a different direction from her previous endeavours , incorporating classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music . The album features instrumentation from acoustic guitars , drums , synthesizers and Cuban musical instruments . The topic for the songs range from love , freedom , and in the case of Papa Do n't Preach , social issues like teenage pregnancy . After its release , True Blue received critical acclaim , with music critics who complimented the album as the archetype of the late 1980s and early 1990s pop albums . They also praised the fact that Madonna 's voice sounded stronger than it did on her previous efforts , while commending Madonna 's skills as a singer , songwriter and entertainer . True Blue was an immediate global success , reaching number one in then record-breaking 28 countries across the world , including Australia , Canada , France , Germany , the United Kingdom and the United States .

  "/wiki/Dance_music": "Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing . It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement . In terms of performance , the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music . While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times ( for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians ) , the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances . In the Baroque period , the major dance styles were noble court dances ( see Baroque dance ) . In the classical music era , the minuet was frequently used as a third movement , although in this context it would not accompany any dancing . The waltz also arose later in the classical era . Both remained part of the romantic music period , which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle , mazurka , ecossaise , ballade and polonaise . Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century 's Western ballroom and social dance music . During the early 20th century , ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working class who attended public dance halls . Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s . In the 1930s , called the Swing era , Swing music was the popular dance music in America .",

Nu metal bands have drawn elements and influences from a variety of musical styles , including multiple genres of heavy metal . Nu metal rarely features guitar solos ; the genre is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs . Many nu metal guitarists use seven-string guitars that are down-tuned to play a heavier sound . DJs are occasionally featured in nu metal to provide instrumentation such as sampling , turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds . Vocal styles in nu metal include singing , rapping , screaming and growling . Nu metal is one of the key genres of the new wave of American heavy metal .

Nu metal 's popularity continued during the early 2000s , with bands such as Papa Roach , Staind , and P.O.D . all selling multi-platinum albums , and came to a peak with Linkin Park 's diamond-selling album Hybrid Theory . However , by the mid-2000s , the oversaturation of bands combined with the under-performance of a number of high-profile releases led to nu metal 's decline , leading to the rise of metalcore and many nu metal bands disbanding or abandoning their established sound in favor of other genres . During the 2010s , there was a nu metal revival ; many bands that combine nu metal with other genres ( for example , metalcore and deathcore ) emerged and some nu metal bands from the 1990s and early 2000s returned to the nu metal sound .",

  "/wiki/Hip_hop": "Hip hop or hip-hop , is a culture and art movement that was created by African Americans , Latino Americans and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx , New York City . The origin of the name is often disputed . It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx . While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music ( including rap ) , hip hop is characterized by nine elements , of which only four are considered essential to understanding hip hop musically . Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined these main pillars of hip hop culture , coining the terms : rapping ( also called MCing or emceeing ) , a rhythmic vocal rhyming style ( orality ) ; DJing ( and turntablism ) , which is making music with record players and DJ mixers ( aural/sound and music creation ) ; b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing ( movement/dance ) ; and graffiti . Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are : hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement ( intellectual/philosophical ) ; beatboxing , a percussive vocal style ; street entrepreneurship ; hip hop language ; and hip hop fashion and style , among others . The fifth element , although debated , is commonly considered either street knowledge , hip hop fashion , or beatboxing . The Bronx hip hop scene emerged in the mid-1970s from neighborhood block parties thrown by the Black Spades , an African-American group that has been described as being a gang , a club , and a music group . Brother-sister duo Clive Campbell , a.k.a . DJ Kool Herc , and Cindy Campbell additionally hosted DJ parties in the Bronx and are credited for the rise in the genre . Hip hop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world . These elements were adapted and developed considerably , particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades .",

  "/wiki/Jazz": "Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans , United States . It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , and developed from roots in blues and ragtime . Jazz is seen by many as America 's classical music . Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression . It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation . Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation . Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music . Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as one of America 's original art forms . As jazz spread around the world , it drew on national , regional , and local musical cultures , which gave rise to different styles . New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles . Bebop emerged in the 1940s , shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging musician 's music which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation .",

  "/wiki/Acoustic_rock": "Acoustic music is music that solely or primarily uses instruments that produce sound through acoustic means , as opposed to electric or electronic means ; typically the phrase refers to that made by acoustic string instruments . [ citation needed ] While all music was once acoustic , the retronym acoustic music appeared after the advent of electric instruments , such as the electric guitar , electric violin , electric organ and synthesizer . Acoustic string instrumentations had long been a subset of popular music , particularly in folk . It stood in contrast to various other types of music in various eras , including big band music in the pre-rock era , and electric music in the rock era . Music reviewer Craig Conley suggests , When music is labeled acoustic , unplugged , or unwired , the assumption seems to be that other types of music are cluttered by technology and overproduction and therefore are n't as pure .",
  "/wiki/Acoustic_blues": "Country blues ( also folk blues , rural blues , backwoods blues , or downhome blues ) is one of the earliest forms of blues music . The mainly solo vocal with acoustic fingerstyle guitar accompaniment developed in the rural Southern United States in the early 1900s . Artists such as Blind Lemon Jefferson ( Texas ) , Charley Patton ( Mississippi ) , Blind Willie McTell ( Georgia ) were among the first to record blues songs in the 1920s . Country blues ran parallel to urban blues , which was popular in cities . Folklorist Alan Lomax was one of the first to use the term and applied it to a field recording he made of Muddy Waters at the Stovall Plantation , Mississippi , in 1941 . In 1959 , music historian Samuel Charters wrote The Country Blues , an influential scholarly work on the subject . He also produced an album , also titled The Country Blues , with early recordings by Jefferson , McTell , Sleepy John Estes , Bukka White , and Robert Johnson . Charters 's works helped to introduce the then-nearly forgotten music to the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and 1960s . The acoustic roots-focused movement also gave rise to the terms folk blues and acoustic blues , especially being applied to performances and recordings made around this period . Country blues has also been used to describe regional acoustic styles , such as Delta blues , Piedmont blues , or the earliest Chicago , Texas , and Memphis blues .",

The Wailers subsequently released eleven further studio albums ; while initially employing louder instrumentation and singing , the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s , which coincided with the singer 's conversion to Rastafarianism . During this period Marley relocated to London , and the group typified their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers ( 1971 ) . The group attained international success after the release of the albums Catch a Fire and Burnin ' ( both 1973 ) , and forged a reputation as touring artists .

  "/wiki/Reggae": "Reggae ( /\u02c8r\u025b\u0261e\u026a/ ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s . The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora . A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals , Do the Reggay was the first popular song to use the word reggae , effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience . While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music , the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues , especially the New Orleans R & B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint , and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady . Reggae usually relates news , social gossip , and political commentary . Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field , being known first as rudie blues , then ska , later blue beat , and rock steady . It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section . The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady ; from the latter , reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument . Reggae is deeply linked to Rastafari , an Afrocentric religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s , aiming at promoting Pan Africanism . Soon after the Rastafarian movement appeared , the international popularity of reggae music became associated with and increased the visibility of Rastafarianism spreading the Rastafari gospel throughout the world . Reggae music is an important means of transporting vital messages of Rastafarianism . The musician becomes the messenger , and as Rastafarians see it , the soldier and the musician are tools for change .",

  "/wiki/Rock_music": "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the early 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom . It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll , a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues , rhythm and blues , and from country music . Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical styles . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass , drums , and one or more singers . Usually , rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political . By the late 1960s classic rock period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , southern rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s .",

  "/wiki/Folk_rock": "Folk rock is a hybrid music genre combining elements of folk music and rock music , which arose in the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom in the mid-1960s . In the U.S. , folk rock emerged from the folk music revival and the influence that the Beatles and other British Invasion bands had on members of that movement . Performers such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds - several of whose members had earlier played in folk ensembles - attempted to blend the sounds of rock with their pre-existing folk repertoire , adopting the use of electric instrumentation and drums in a way previously discouraged in the U.S. folk community . The term folk rock was initially used in the U.S. music press in June 1965 to describe the Byrds ' music . The commercial success of the Byrds ' cover version of Dylan 's Mr. Tambourine Man and their debut album of the same name , along with Dylan 's own recordings with rock instrumentation - on the albums Bringing It All Back Home ( 1965 ) , Highway 61 Revisited ( 1965 ) , and Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) - encouraged other folk acts , such as Simon & Garfunkel , to use electric backing on their records and new groups , such as Buffalo Springfield , to form . Dylan 's controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on 25 July 1965 , where he was backed by an electric band , was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre . During the late 1960s in Britain and Europe , a distinct , eclectic British folk rock style was created by Pentangle , Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell . Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock , British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire , leading to other variants , including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band and Celtic rock .",

Purple Rain was musically denser than Prince 's previous albums , emphasizing full band performances , and multiple layers of guitars , keyboards , electronic synthesizer effects , drum machines , and other instruments .

  "/wiki/New_wave_music": "New wave is a rock music subgenre encompassing numerous pop-oriented music styles popular in the late 1970s and the 1980s . It is rooted in mid-1970s punk rock . New wave moved away from traditional blues and rock and roll sounds to create pop/rock music that incorporated disco , mod and electronic music . It engendered subgenres and fusions , including synth-pop . New wave differs from other movements with ties to first-wave punk , as it displays characteristics common to pop music rather than the more artsy post-punk . Although it incorporates much of the original punk rock sound and ethos , new wave exhibits greater complexity in both music and lyrics . Common characteristics of new wave music include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions , and a distinctive visual style featured in music videos and fashion . New wave was promoted heavily by MTV ( the Buggles ' Video Killed the Radio Star was broadcast as the first music video to promote the channel 's launch ) . The popularity of several new wave artists is often attributed to their exposure on the channel . In the mid-1980s , differences between new wave and other music genres began to blur . New wave has enjoyed resurgences since the 1990s after a rising nostalgia for several new wave-influenced artists . During the 2000s , a number of acts explored new wave and post-punk influences and were sometimes labeled new wave of new wave .",

  "/wiki/Funk": "Funk is a music genre that originated in African-American communities in the mid-1960s when African-American musicians created a rhythmic , danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music , psychedelic rock , jazz , and rhythm and blues ( R & B ) . Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bassline played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer , often at slower tempos than other popular music . Like much of African-inspired music , funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that created a hypnotic and danceable feel . Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz , such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths , or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths . Funk originated in the mid-1960s , with James Brown 's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat - with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure ( The One ) , and the application of swung 16th notes and syncopation on all basslines , drum patterns , and guitar riffs . Other musical groups , including Sly and the Family Stone , The Meters , and Parliament-Funkadelic , soon began to adopt and develop Brown 's innovations . Notable funk women include Chaka Khan , Marva Whitney , Lyn Collins , Brides of Funkenstein , Vicki Anderson , Anna King ( The JB 's singer ) , and Parlet . Funk derivatives include the psychedelic funk of Sly Stone and George Clinton ; the avant-funk of groups such as Talking Heads and the Pop Group ; boogie , a form of post-disco dance music ; electro music , a hybrid of electronic music and funk ; funk metal ( e.g. , Living Colour , Faith No More ) ; G-funk , a mix of gangsta rap and funk ; Timba , a form of funky Cuban popular dance music ; and funk jam . Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and various forms of electronic dance music , such as house music , and Detroit techno . It is also the main influence of go-go , a subgenre associated with funk .",

It combines elements of African-American gospel music , rhythm and blues and jazz . Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States , where record labels such as Motown , Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement . Soul also became popular around the world , directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa . According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , soul is music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky , secular testifying . Catchy rhythms , stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves , are an important feature of soul music . Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound . The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions , twirls and auxiliary sounds . Soul music reflected the African-American identity and it stressed the importance of an African-American culture . The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music , which boasted pride in being black . Soul music dominated the U.S. R & B chart in the 1960s , and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S. , Britain and elsewhere . By 1968 , the soul music genre had begun to splinter .",
