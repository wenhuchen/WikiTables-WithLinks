  "section_text": "After the election of the Afghan Parliament in 2005 the cabinet picked by Karzai had to be approved , as is required by the Afghan Constitution . At the time the cabinet started in 2004 there was no parliament in session , so the parliamentary approval could only take place after the 2005 elections . Karzai took this opportunity to make some changes in the composition of his cabinet . Some cabinet members got another portfolio , other cabinet members were replaced by new ministers . The most notable change was the replacement of Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah by Rangeen Dadfar Spanta . Abdullah was offered several lesser posts but refused them . [ 11 ] With the resignation of Abdullah Abdullah , the last of the powerful trio of the Shura-e Nazar faction , consisting of Abdullah Abdullah , Yunus Qanuni and Mohammad Fahim left the government , making Ismail Khan the only warlord left in the cabinet . Apart from changes in the composition also minor changes in the portfolios of the ministers were made . Karzai created a new position of 'Senior Minister ' for former vice-president Amin Arsala and merged the ministers of information and culture and Youth Affairs to a new minister of Youth and Culture . The Ministry of Disabled and Martyrs was merged with the Ministry of Social Affairs . The new Mines minister lost the portfolio of industries , instead Arsala 's successor now became minister of commerce and industries . On 22 March 2006 Karzai announced the following changes would be made in the cabinet he would send to the Wolesi Jirga for approval .",
