  "/wiki/Comedian": "A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience by making them laugh . This might be through jokes or amusing situations , or acting foolish ( as in slapstick ) or employing prop comedy . A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comedian . A popular saying , variously quoted but generally attributed to Ed Wynn , is , A comic says funny things ; a comedian says things funny , which draws a distinction between how much of the comedy can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona . Since the 1980s , a new wave of comedy , called alternative comedy , has grown in popularity with its more offbeat and experimental style . This normally involves more experiential , or observational reporting , e.g . Alexei Sayle , Daniel Tosh and Malcolm Hardee . As far as content is concerned , comedians such as Tommy Tiernan , Des Bishop , Kevin Hart and Joan Rivers draw on their background to poke fun at themselves , while others such as Jon Stewart , and Ben Elton have very strong political and cultural undertones . Many comics achieve a cult following while touring famous comedy hubs such as the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal , the Edinburgh Fringe , and Melbourne Comedy Festival in Australia . Often a comic 's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award , such as the Edinburgh Comedy Award ( formerly the Perrier comedy award ) . Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment , such as film and television , where they become more widely known ; e.g. , Eddie Izzard or Ricky Gervais . However , a comic 's stand-up success does not guarantee a film 's critical or box office success .",

  "/wiki/CBS": "CBS ( an initialism of the network 's former name , the Columbia Broadcasting System ) is an American English-language commercial broadcast television and radio network that is the flagship property of the CBS Entertainment Group division of ViacomCBS . The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City ( at the CBS Broadcast Center ) and Los Angeles ( at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center ) . CBS is sometimes referred to as the Eye Network , in reference to the company 's trademark symbol , in use since 1951 . It has also been called the Tiffany Network , alluding to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of William S. Paley . It can also refer to some of CBS 's first demonstrations of color television , which were held in a former Tiffany & Co. building in New York City in 1950 . The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc. , a collection of 16 radio stations purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System . Under Paley 's guidance , CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States , and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks . In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as CBS , Inc . The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1995 , renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting , Inc. in 1997 , and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation . In 2000 CBS came under the control of the first Viacom , which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971 . In late 2005 , Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television , radio , and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets , with the CBS television network at its core . CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements , which also controlled the second Viacom until December 4 , 2019 , when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS .",
  "/wiki/Maude_(TV_series)": "Maude is an American sitcom television series that was originally broadcast on the CBS network from September 12 , 1972 , until April 22 , 1978 . Maude stars Beatrice Arthur as Maude Findlay , an outspoken , middle-aged , politically liberal woman living in suburban Tuckahoe , Westchester County , New York , with her fourth husband , household appliance store owner Walter Findlay ( Bill Macy ) . Maude embraces the tenets of women 's liberation , always votes for Democratic Party candidates , and advocates for civil rights and racial and gender equality . However , her overbearing and sometimes domineering personality often gets her into trouble when speaking about these issues . The show was billed as the first spin-off of All in the Family , on which Beatrice Arthur had made two appearances in the character of Maude , Edith Bunker 's cousin . Like All in the Family , Maude was a sitcom with topical storylines created by producers Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin . Unusual for a U.S. sitcom , several episodes ( such as Maude 's Night Out and The Convention ) featured only the characters of Maude and her husband Walter , in what amounted to half-hour two-hander teleplays . The show 's theme song , And Then There 's Maude , was written by Marilyn and Alan Bergman and Dave Grusin , and performed by Donny Hathaway .",
  "/wiki/Spin-off_(media)": "In media , a spin-off ( or spinoff ) is a radio program , television program , video game , film , or any narrative work , derived from already existing works that focus on more details and different aspects from the original work ( e.g . particular topics , characters or events ) . One of the earliest spin-offs of the modern media era , if not the first , happened in 1941 when the supporting character Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve from the old time radio comedy show Fibber McGee and Molly became the star of his own program The Great Gildersleeve ( 1941-1957 ) . In genre fiction , the term parallels the usage in television ; it is usually meant to indicate a substantial change in narrative viewpoint and activity from that ( previous ) storyline based on the activities of the series ' principal protagonist and so is a shift to that action and overall narrative thread of some other protagonist , which now becomes the central or main thread ( storyline ) of the new sub-series . The new protagonist generally appears first as a minor or supporting character in the main story line within a given milieu , and it is very common for the previous protagonist to have a supporting or cameo role , at the least as a historical mention , in the new sub-series . Spin-offs sometimes generate their own spin-offs , leaving the new show in its own series only vaguely connected to the original series .",

  "/wiki/Jazz": "Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans , United States . It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , and developed from roots in blues and ragtime . Jazz is seen by many as America 's classical music . Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression . It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation . Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation . Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music . Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as one of America 's original art forms . As jazz spread around the world , it drew on national , regional , and local musical cultures , which gave rise to different styles . New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles . Bebop emerged in the 1940s , shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging musician 's music which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation .",

In her prime , she also possessed good agility and bel canto technique ( see for example her renditions of the 'Veil Song ' from Verdi 's Don Carlo in the 1970s and 1980s , as well as her Ernani from the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1984 ) . She was particularly noted for her fiery temperament and dramatic intensity on stage . More recently , she has also become known as a recitalist and interpreter of lieder , and as a teacher .

  "/wiki/Opera": "Opera is a form of theatre in which music has a leading role and the parts are taken by singers , but is distinct from musical theater . Such a work ( the literal translation of Italian word opera ) is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts , such as acting , scenery , costume , and sometimes dance or ballet . The performance is typically given in an opera house , accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble , which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor . Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition . Originally understood as an entirely sung piece , in contrast to a play with songs , opera has come to include numerous genres , including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theater , Singspiel and Op\u00e9ra comique . In traditional number opera , singers employ two styles of singing : recitative , a speech-inflected style , and self-contained arias . The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama . Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century ( with Jacopo Peri 's mostly lost Dafne , produced in Florence in 1598 ) and soon spread through the rest of Europe : Heinrich Sch\u00fctz in Germany , Jean-Baptiste Lully in France , and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century . In the 18th century , Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe ( except France ) , attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel . Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera , until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his reform operas in the 1760s . The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas , especially The Marriage of Figaro ( Le nozze di Figaro ) , Don Giovanni , and Cos\u00ec fan tutte , as well as Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail ( The Abduction from the Seraglio ) , and The Magic Flute ( Die Zauberfl\u00f6te ) , landmarks in the German tradition . The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style , with Gioachino Rossini , Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating works that are still performed .",
