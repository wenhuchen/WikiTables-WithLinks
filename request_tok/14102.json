  "/wiki/Sphinx": "A sphinx ( /\u02c8sf\u026a\u014bks/ SFINGKS , Ancient Greek : \u03c3\u03c6\u03af\u03b3\u03be [ sp\u02b0\u00ed\u014bks ] , Boeotian : \u03c6\u03af\u03be [ p\u02b0\u00ed\u02d0ks ] , plural sphinxes or sphinges ) is a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion . In Greek tradition , the sphinx has the head of a woman , the haunches of a lion , and the wings of a bird . She is mythicised as treacherous and merciless . Those who can not answer her riddle suffer a fate typical in such mythological stories , as they are killed and eaten by this ravenous monster . This deadly version of a sphinx appears in the myth and drama of Oedipus . Unlike the Greek sphinx , which was a woman , the Egyptian sphinx is typically shown as a man ( an androsphinx ( Ancient Greek : \u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c6\u03b9\u03b3\u03be ) ) . In addition , the Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent , but having a ferocious strength similar to the malevolent Greek version . Both were thought of as guardians , and often flank the entrances to temples . In European decorative art , the sphinx enjoyed a major revival during the Renaissance . Later , the sphinx image , initially very similar to the original Ancient Egyptian concept , was exported into many other cultures , albeit there often interpreted quite differently due to translations of descriptions of the originals and through evolution of the concept in relation to other cultural traditions . Sphinx depictions are generally associated with architectural structures such as royal tombs or religious temples . The oldest known sphinx was found 195 kilometres ( 120 mi ) to the east at K\u00f6rtik Tepe , Turkey , and was dated to 9,500 BCE .",

  "/wiki/Samson_Slaying_a_Philistine": "The sculpture of Samson Slaying a Philistine is the earliest of the great marble groups by Giambologna , sculptor to the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany , and the only substantial work by the artist to have left Italy . It was commissioned in about 1562 , by Francesco de ' Medici for a fountain in Florence , but was later sent as a gift to Spain being placed in Palacio de la Ribera , Valladolid . The group was presented to the Prince of Wales , later King Charles I , in 1623 while he was in Spain negotiating a marriage contract , and it soon became the most famous Italian sculpture in England . On its arrival in England it was given to the king 's favourite , the Duke of Buckingham , and subsequently changed hands three times before coming to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1954 . The sculpture shows Samson wielding the jawbone of an ass in order to slay one of the Philistines who have taunted him . It is a good example of the multiple viewpoints seen in Giambologna 's work ; the spiralling movement of the bodies means that there is no main view . The dramatic pose is based on a composition by Michelangelo , who was in his late seventies when Giambologna met him in Rome . The group was carved from just one block of marble , supported by only five narrow points . Although the marble is weathered from three centuries outdoors , it still shows Giambologna 's sensitive carving .",
  "/wiki/Hercules": "Hercules ( /\u02c8h\u025c\u02d0rkjuli\u02d0z , -j\u0259-/ ) is a Roman hero and god . He was the Roman equivalent of the Greek divine hero Heracles , who was the son of Zeus ( Roman equivalent Jupiter ) and the mortal Alcmene .

The Romans adapted the Greek hero 's iconography and myths for their literature and art under the name Hercules . In later Western art and literature and in popular culture , Hercules is more commonly used than Heracles as the name of the hero . Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics , which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him . This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the later tradition .",

Like Achilles in a later generation , he was trained by the centaur Chiron . He fell to the fatal wrath of Artemis , but the surviving details of his transgression vary : the only certainty is in what Aktaion suffered , his pathos , and what Artemis did : the hunter became the hunted ; he was transformed into a stag , and his raging hounds , struck with a 'wolf 's frenzy ' ( Lyssa ) , tore him apart as they would a stag . This is the iconic motif by which Actaeon is recognized , both in ancient art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance depictions .",
