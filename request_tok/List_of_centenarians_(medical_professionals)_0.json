  "/wiki/Physician": "A physician ( American English ) , medical practitioner ( Commonwealth English ) , medical doctor , or simply doctor , is a professional who practises medicine , which is concerned with promoting , maintaining , or restoring health through the study , diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of disease , injury , and other physical and mental impairments . Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories , types of patients , and methods of treatment - known as specialities - or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals , families , and communities - known as general practice . Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines , such as anatomy and physiology , underlying diseases and their treatment - the science of medicine - and also a decent competence in its applied practice - the art or craft of medicine . Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world . Degrees and other qualifications vary widely , but there are some common elements , such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration , compassion , and benevolence for their patients .",
  "/wiki/Birth_control": "Birth control , also known as contraception and fertility control , is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy . Birth control has been used since ancient times , but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century . Planning , making available , and using birth control is called family planning . Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally , religiously , or politically undesirable . The most effective methods of birth control are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females , intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) , and implantable birth control . This is followed by a number of hormone-based methods including oral pills , patches , vaginal rings , and injections . Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms , diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods . The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation . Sterilization , while highly effective , is not usually reversible ; all other methods are reversible , most immediately upon stopping them . Safe sex practices , such as with the use of male or female condoms , can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections . Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases . Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex .",

  "/wiki/Nurse": "Nursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals , families , and communities so they may attain , maintain , or recover optimal health and quality of life . Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care , training , and scope of practice . Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority . Many nurses provide care within the ordering scope of physicians , and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers . However , nurse practitioners are permitted by most jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings . Since the postwar period , nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials , and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing . Nurses develop a plan of care , working collaboratively with physicians , therapists , the patient , the patient 's family , and other team members that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life . In the United States and the United Kingdom , advanced practice nurses , such as clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners , diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies , depending on individual state regulations . Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a multidisciplinary health care team such as therapists , medical practitioners , and dietitians . Nurses provide care both interdependently , for example , with physicians , and independently as nursing professionals .",

  "/wiki/Ambulance": "An ambulance is a medically equipped vehicle which transports patients to treatment facilities , such as hospitals . In some instances , out-of-hospital medical care is provided to the patient . Ambulances are used to respond to medical emergencies by emergency medical services . For this purpose , they are generally equipped with flashing warning lights and sirens . They can rapidly transport paramedics and other first responders to the scene , carry equipment for administering emergency care and transport patients to hospital or other definitive care . Most ambulances use a design based on vans or pick-up trucks . Others take the form of motorcycles , cars , buses , aircraft and boats . Generally , vehicles count as an ambulance if they can transport patients . However , it varies by jurisdiction as to whether a non-emergency patient transport vehicle ( also called an ambulette ) is counted as an ambulance . These vehicles are not usually ( although there are exceptions ) equipped with life-support equipment , and are usually crewed by staff with fewer qualifications than the crew of emergency ambulances . Conversely , EMS agencies may also have emergency response vehicles that can not transport patients . These are known by names such as nontransporting EMS vehicles , fly-cars or response vehicles .",

  "/wiki/Epidemiology": "Epidemiology is the study and analysis of the distribution ( who , when , and where ) , patterns and determinants of health and disease conditions in defined populations . It is a cornerstone of public health , and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare . Epidemiologists help with study design , collection , and statistical analysis of data , amend interpretation and dissemination of results ( including peer review and occasional systematic review ) . Epidemiology has helped develop methodology used in clinical research , public health studies , and , to a lesser extent , basic research in the biological sciences . Major areas of epidemiological study include disease causation , transmission , outbreak investigation , disease surveillance , environmental epidemiology , forensic epidemiology , occupational epidemiology , screening , biomonitoring , and comparisons of treatment effects such as in clinical trials . Epidemiologists rely on other scientific disciplines like biology to better understand disease processes , statistics to make efficient use of the data and draw appropriate conclusions , social sciences to better understand proximate and distal causes , and engineering for exposure assessment . Epidemiology , literally meaning the study of what is upon the people , is derived from Greek epi , meaning 'upon , among ' , demos , meaning 'people , district ' , and logos , meaning 'study , word , discourse ' , suggesting that it applies only to human populations . However , the term is widely used in studies of zoological populations ( veterinary epidemiology ) , although the term epizoology is available , and it has also been applied to studies of plant populations ( botanical or plant disease epidemiology ) . The distinction between epidemic and endemic was first drawn by Hippocrates , to distinguish between diseases that are visited upon a population ( epidemic ) from those that reside within a population ( endemic ) . The term epidemiology appears to have first been used to describe the study of epidemics in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba in Epidemiolog\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola . Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population , a condition known as a syndemic . The term epidemiology is now widely applied to cover the description and causation of not only epidemic disease , but of disease in general , and even many non-disease , health-related conditions , such as high blood pressure , depression and obesity .",

  "/wiki/Pertussis": "Whooping cough , also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough , is a highly contagious bacterial disease . Initially , symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose , fever , and mild cough . This is followed by weeks of severe coughing fits . Following a fit of coughing , a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in . The coughing may last for 10 or more weeks , hence the phrase 100-day cough . A person may cough so hard that they vomit , break ribs , or become very tired from the effort . Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods where they do not breathe . The time between infection and the onset of symptoms is usually seven to ten days . Disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated , but symptoms are typically milder . Pertussis is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis . It is spread easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person . People are infectious from the start of symptoms until about three weeks into the coughing fits .",
  "/wiki/Vaccine": "A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease . A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe , its toxins , or one of its surface proteins . The agent stimulates the body 's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat , destroy it , and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future . Vaccines can be prophylactic ( to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or wild pathogen ) , or therapeutic ( e.g. , vaccines against cancer , which are being investigated ) . The administration of vaccines is called vaccination . Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases ; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio , measles , and tetanus from much of the world . The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified ; for example , vaccines that have proven effective include the influenza vaccine , the HPV vaccine , and the chicken pox vaccine . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available for twenty-five different preventable infections . The terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae ( smallpox of the cow ) , the term devised by Edward Jenner to denote cowpox . He used it in 1798 in the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae Known as the Cow Pox , in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox . In 1881 , to honor Jenner , Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed .",
