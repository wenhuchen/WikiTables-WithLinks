  "/wiki/Steel": "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements . Because of its high tensile strength and low cost , it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , trains , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel . Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic and face-centered cubic , depending on its temperature . In the body-centered cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell ; in the face-centered cubic , there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices . It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In pure iron , the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another , and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed . In steel , small amounts of carbon , other elements , and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight . Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements , as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel ( either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases ) , slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile , and thus controls and enhances its qualities . These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . The increase in steel 's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron 's ductility .",
  "/wiki/Sculpture": "Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions . It is one of the plastic arts . Durable sculptural processes originally used carving ( the removal of material ) and modelling ( the addition of material , as clay ) , in stone , metal , ceramics , wood and other materials but , since Modernism , there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process . A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving , assembled by welding or modelling , or molded or cast . Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials , and often represents the majority of the surviving works ( other than pottery ) from ancient cultures , though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely . However , most ancient sculpture was brightly painted , and this has been lost . Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures , and until recent centuries large sculptures , too expensive for private individuals to create , were usually an expression of religion or politics . Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean , India and China , as well as many in Central and South America and Africa . The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece , and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period . During the Middle Ages , Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith . The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo 's David . Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body , with the making of constructed sculpture , and the presentation of found objects as finished art works .",

  "/wiki/Amish": "The Amish ( /\u02c8\u0251\u02d0m\u026a\u0283/ ; Pennsylvania German : Amisch ; German : Amische ) are a group of traditionalist Christian church fellowships with Swiss German Anabaptist origins . They are closely related to , but distinct from , Mennonite churches . The Amish are known for simple living , plain dress , and reluctance to adopt many conveniences of modern technology . The history of the Amish church began with a schism in Switzerland within a group of Swiss and Alsatian Anabaptists in 1693 led by Jakob Ammann . Those who followed Ammann became known as Amish . In the second half of the 19th century , the Amish divided into Old Order Amish and Amish Mennonites . The latter do not eschew motor cars , whereas the Old Order Amish retained much of their traditional culture . When people refer to the Amish today , they normally refer to the Old Order Amish . In the early 18th century , many Amish and Mennonites immigrated to Pennsylvania for a variety of reasons . Today , the Old Order Amish , the New Order Amish , and the Old Beachy Amish continue to speak Pennsylvania German , also known as Pennsylvania Dutch , although two different Alemannic dialects are used by Old Order Amish in Adams and Allen counties in Indiana . As of 2000 [ update ] , over 165,000 Old Order Amish lived in the United States and about 1,500 lived in Canada . A 2008 study suggested their numbers had increased to 227,000 , and in 2010 , a study suggested their population had grown by 10 percent in the past two years to 249,000 , with increasing movement to the West .",

  "/wiki/Quilting": "Quilting is the process of sewing two or more layers of fabric together to make a thicker padded material , usually to create a quilt or quilted garment . Typically , quilting is done with three layers : the top fabric or quilt top , batting or insulating material and backing material , but many different styles are adopted . The process of quilting uses a needle and thread to join two or more layers of material to make a quilt . The quilter 's hand or sewing machine passes the needle and thread through all layers and then brings the needle back up . The process is repeated across the entire area where quilting is wanted . Rocking , straight or running stitches are commonly used with these stitches being functional and/or decorative . Quilting is done to create bed coverings , art quilt wall hangings , clothing , and a variety of textile products . Quilting can produce different effects depending on the chosen pattern ( s ) , such as a uniform effect across the material , or with dense quilting , can flatten one area so that another stands out . The whole process of creating a quilt or quilted garment also involves other steps such as designing , cutting , piecing , appliqu\u00e9 , and binding . A person who works at quilting is termed a quilter . Quilting can be done by hand , via a sewing machine , or by a specialized longarm quilting system . Quilt stores often sell fabric , thread , patterns and other goods that are used for quilting .",

  "/wiki/Ceramic": "A ceramic ( Ancient Greek : \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 - keramik\u00f3s , potter 's , from \u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 - k\u00e9ramos , potter 's clay ) is a solid material comprising an inorganic compound of metal , non-metal or ionic and covalent bonds . Common examples are earthenware , porcelain , and brick . The crystallinity of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline , vitrified , and often completely amorphous ( e.g. , glasses ) . Most often , fired ceramics are either vitrified or semi-vitrified as is the case with earthenware , stoneware , and porcelain . Varying crystallinity and electron composition in the ionic and covalent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be good thermal and electrical insulators ( extensively researched in ceramic engineering ) . With such a large range of possible options for the composition/structure of a ceramic ( e.g . nearly all of the elements , nearly all types of bonding , and all levels of crystallinity ) , the breadth of the subject is vast , and identifiable attributes ( e.g . hardness , toughness , electrical conductivity , etc . ) are difficult to specify for the group as a whole . General properties such as high melting temperature , high hardness , poor conductivity , high moduli of elasticity , chemical resistance and low ductility are the norm , with known exceptions to each of these rules ( e.g . piezoelectric ceramics , glass transition temperature , superconductive ceramics , etc. ) . Many composites , such as fiberglass and carbon fiber , while containing ceramic materials , are not considered to be part of the ceramic family .",

  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",
  "/wiki/Concrete": "Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement ( cement paste ) that hardens ( cures ) over time . In the past limebased cement binders were often used , such as lime putty , but sometimes with other hydraulic cements , such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete ( for its visual resemblance to Portland stone ) . Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with different methods of binding aggregate together , including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder , which is frequently used for road surfaces , and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder . When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water , the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape . The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses . Often , additives ( such as pozzolans or superplasticizers ) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material . Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials ( such as rebar ) embedded to provide tensile strength , yielding reinforced concrete . Because concrete cures ( which is not the same as drying such as with paint ) how concrete is handled after it is poured is just as important as before . Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials . Its usage worldwide , ton for ton , is twice that of steel , wood , plastics , and aluminum combined . Globally , the ready-mix concrete industry , the largest segment of the concrete market , is projected to exceed $ 600 billion in revenue by 2025 . Concrete is distinct from mortar .",
  "/wiki/Fountain": "A fountain ( from the Latin fons ( genitive fontis ) , a source or spring ) is a piece of architecture which pours water into a basin or jets it into the air to supply drinking water and/or for a decorative or dramatic effect . Fountains were originally purely functional , connected to springs or aqueducts and used to provide drinking water and water for bathing and washing to the residents of cities , towns and villages . Until the late 19th century most fountains operated by gravity , and needed a source of water higher than the fountain , such as a reservoir or aqueduct , to make the water flow or jet into the air . In addition to providing drinking water , fountains were used for decoration and to celebrate their builders . Roman fountains were decorated with bronze or stone masks of animals or heroes . In the Middle Ages , Moorish and Muslim garden designers used fountains to create miniature versions of the gardens of paradise . King Louis XIV of France used fountains in the Gardens of Versailles to illustrate his power over nature . The baroque decorative fountains of Rome in the 17th and 18th centuries marked the arrival point of restored Roman aqueducts and glorified the Popes who built them . By the end of the 19th century , as indoor plumbing became the main source of drinking water , urban fountains became purely decorative . Mechanical pumps replaced gravity and allowed fountains to recycle water and to force it high into the air . The Jet d'Eau in Lake Geneva , built in 1951 , shoots water 140 metres ( 460 ft ) in the air . The highest such fountain in the world is King Fahd 's Fountain in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , which spouts water 260 metres ( 850 ft ) above the Red Sea .",
  "/wiki/Wood": "Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants . It is an organic material - a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression . Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees , or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs . [ citation needed ] In a living tree it performs a support function , enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves . It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves , other growing tissues , and the roots . Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties , and to material engineered from wood , or wood chips or fiber . Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel , as a construction material , for making tools and weapons , furniture and paper . More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives , such as cellophane and cellulose acetate . As of 2005 , the growing stock of forests worldwide was about 434 billion cubic meters , 47% of which was commercial . As an abundant , carbon-neutral renewable resource , woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy . In 1991 approximately 3.5 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested . Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction .",
  "/wiki/Iron": "Iron ( /\u02c8a\u026a\u0259rn/ ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe ( from Latin : ferrum ) and atomic number 26 . It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table . It is by mass the most common element on Earth , forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core . It is the fourth most common element in the Earth 's crust . In its metallic state , iron is rare in the Earth 's crust , limited to deposition by meteorites . Iron ores , by contrast , are among the most abundant in the Earth 's crust , although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C ( 2,730 \u00b0F ) or higher , about 500 \u00b0C ( 900 \u00b0F ) higher than what is enough to smelt copper . Humans started to master that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE [ not verified in body ] , and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys , in some regions , only around 1200 BCE . That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age . In the modern world , iron alloys , such as steel , inox , cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals , because of their high mechanical properties and low cost . Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray . However , iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides , commonly known as rust . Unlike the oxides of some other metals , that form passivating layers , rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off , exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion .",

  "/wiki/Stainless_steel": "In metallurgy , stainless steel , also known as inox steel or inox from French inoxydable ( inoxidizable ) , is a steel alloy , with a minimum of 11% chromium content by mass and a maximum of 1.2% carbon by mass . Stainless steels are most notable for their corrosion resistance , which increases with increasing chromium content . Additions of molybdenum increases corrosion resistance in reducing acids and against pitting attack in chloride solutions . Thus , there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure . Resistance to corrosion and staining , low maintenance , and familiar luster make stainless steel an ideal material for many applications where both the strength of steel and corrosion resistance are required . Stainless steel is rolled into sheets , plates , bars , wire , and tubing to be used in : cookware , cutlery , surgical instruments , major appliances ; construction material in large buildings , such as the Chrysler Building ; industrial equipment ( for example , in paper mills , chemical plants , water treatment ) ; and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products ( for example , chemical tankers and road tankers ) . Corrosion resistance , the ease with which it can be steam cleaned and sterilized , and lack of need for surface coatings has also influenced the use of stainless steel in commercial kitchens and food processing plants .",

  "/wiki/Oil_paint": "Oil paint is a type of slow-drying paint that consists of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil , commonly linseed oil . The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit , and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film . Oil paints have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration , but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century . Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges . Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal . Due to its slow-drying properties , it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation . Thickness of coat has considerable bearing on time required for drying : thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly .",
  "/wiki/Painting": "Painting is the practice of applying paint , pigment , color or other medium to a solid surface ( called the matrix or support ) . The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush , but other implements , such as knives , sponges , and airbrushes , can be used . The final work is also called a painting . Painting is an important form in the visual arts , bringing in elements such as drawing , gesture ( as in gestural painting ) , composition , narration ( as in narrative art ) , or abstraction ( as in abstract art ) . Paintings can be naturalistic and representational ( as in a still life or landscape painting ) , photographic , abstract , narrative , symbolistic ( as in Symbolist art ) , emotive ( as in Expressionism ) , or political in nature ( as in Artivism ) . A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art . Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery , to Biblical scenes Sistine Chapel ceiling , to scenes from the life of Buddha or other images of Eastern religious origin . In art , the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action .

  "/wiki/Kinetic_sculpture": "Kinetic art is art from any medium that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or depends on motion for its effect . Canvas paintings that extend the viewer 's perspective of the artwork and incorporate multidimensional movement are the earliest examples of kinetic art . More pertinently speaking , kinetic art is a term that today most often refers to three-dimensional sculptures and figures such as mobiles that move naturally or are machine operated ( see e. g. videos on this page of works of George Rickey , Uli Aschenborn and Sarnikoff ) . The moving parts are generally powered by wind , a motor or the observer . Kinetic art encompasses a wide variety of overlapping techniques and styles . There is also a portion of kinetic art that includes virtual movement , or rather movement perceived from only certain angles or sections of the work . This term also clashes frequently with the term apparent movement , which many people use when referring to an artwork whose movement is created by motors , machines , or electrically powered systems . Both apparent and virtual movement are styles of kinetic art that only recently have been argued as styles of op art . The amount of overlap between kinetic and op art is not significant enough for artists and art historians to consider merging the two styles under one umbrella term , but there are distinctions that have yet to be made . Kinetic art as a moniker developed from a number of sources . Kinetic art has its origins in the late 19th century impressionist artists such as Claude Monet , Edgar Degas , and \u00c9douard Manet who originally experimented with accentuating the movement of human figures on canvas . This triumvirate of impressionist painters all sought to create art that was more lifelike than their contemporaries ."
