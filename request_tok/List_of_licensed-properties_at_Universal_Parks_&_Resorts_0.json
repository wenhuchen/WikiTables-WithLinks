It stars Bill Murray , Aykroyd , and Ramis as , respectively , Peter Venkman , Ray Stantz , and Egon Spengler , a trio of eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghost-catching business in New York City . The film also stars Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis , and features Annie Potts , William Atherton , and Ernie Hudson in supporting roles . Based on his own fascination with spirituality , Aykroyd conceived Ghostbusters as a project for himself and John Belushi . The protagonists would travel through time and space to combat a host of demonic and supernatural threats . Following Belushi 's death , and with Aykroyd 's concept deemed financially impractical , he was paired with Ramis to rewrite the script to set it in New York City and make it more realistic . Ghostbusters was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects . There was concern about the budget it would require , and little faith in its potential for box office success . On an approximate $ 25-30 million budget , filming took place between October 1983 to January 1984 , on location in New York City and Los Angeles , and on sets at Burbank Studios , Los Angeles . Competition for special effects studios among various movies in development at the time meant that part of the budget was used to co-found a new studio under Richard Edlund . He used a combination of practical effects , miniatures , and puppets to deliver the ghoulish visuals . Ghostbusters was released on June 8 , 1984 , to critical acclaim and became a cultural phenomenon .",

The format of Sesame Street consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience 's viewing habits . With the creation of Sesame Street , producers and writers of a children 's television show used , for the first time , educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content . It was also the first time a show 's educational effects were formally studied . The show , therefore , has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum . Shortly after creating Sesame Street , its producers developed what came to be called the CTW model ( after the production company 's previous name ) , a system of television show planning , production , and evaluation based on collaborations between producers , writers , educators , and researchers . The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements , international sales , and other media . By 2006 , there were independently produced versions , or co-productions , of Sesame Street broadcast in twenty countries . In 2001 , there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of Sesame Street , and by the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , it was broadcast in more than 140 countries .",

Television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and foundation executive Lloyd Morrisett developed the idea to form an organization to produce Sesame Street , a television series which would help children , especially those from low-income families , prepare for school . They spent two years , from 1966 to 1968 , researching , developing , and raising money for the new series . Cooney was named as the Workshop 's first executive director , which was termed one of the most important television developments of the decade . Sesame Street premiered as a series on National Educational Television ( NET ) in the United States on November 10 , 1969 , and moved to NET 's successor , the Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) , in late 1970 . The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970 . Gerald S. Lesser and Edward L. Palmer were hired to perform research for the series ; they were responsible for developing a system of planning , production , and evaluation , and the interaction between television producers and educators , later termed the CTW model . They also hired a staff of producers and writers . After the initial success of Sesame Street , they began to plan for its continued survival , which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series . The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop ; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985 . After Sesame Street 's initial success , the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show , since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects , not sustain them . Government funding ended by 1981 , so the CTW developed other activities , including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs , the publications of books and music , international co-productions , interactive media and new technologies , licensing arrangements , and programs for preschools .",

Peanuts achieved considerable success with its television specials , several of which , including A Charlie Brown Christmas and It 's the Great Pumpkin , Charlie Brown , won or were nominated for Emmy Awards . The Peanuts holiday specials remain popular and are broadcast on ABC in the U.S. during the appropriate seasons , since 2001 .
