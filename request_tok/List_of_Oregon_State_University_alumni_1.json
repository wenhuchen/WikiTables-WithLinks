  "/wiki/Ambassadors_from_the_United_States": "Ambassadors of the United States are persons nominated as ambassadors by the President to serve as United States diplomats to individual nations of the world , to international organizations , and as ambassadors-at-large . Their appointment needs to be confirmed by the United States Senate . An ambassador can be appointed during a recess , but he or she can only serve as ambassador until the end of the next session of Congress unless subsequently confirmed . Ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the President , meaning they can be dismissed at any time . Appointments change regularly for various reasons , such as reassignment or retirement . An ambassador may be a career Foreign Service Officer ( career diplomat - CD ) or a political appointee ( PA ) . In most cases , career foreign service officers serve a tour of approximately three years per ambassadorship whereas political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president . As embassies fall under the State Department 's jurisdiction , ambassadors answer directly to the Secretary of State . The United States Department of State provides lists of ambassadors which are updated periodically . ( A recent list was issued on December 4 , 2018 . A further 24 nominees were confirmed on January 2 , 2019 , and a number of ambassadorships remain vacant . ) A listing by country of past chiefs of mission is maintained by the Office of the Historian of the U.S. Department of State .",
  "/wiki/Burundi": "Burundi ( /b\u0259\u02c8r\u028andi/ ( listen ) , /-\u02c8r\u028cn-/ ) , officially the Republic of Burundi ( Kirundi : Republika y'Uburundi , [ u.\u03b2u.\u027e\u01d4\u02d0.ndi ] ; French : R\u00e9publique du Burundi , [ bu\u0281undi ] or [ by\u0281yndi ] ) , is a landlocked country in the Great Rift Valley where the African Great Lakes region and East Africa converge . It is bordered by Rwanda to the north , Tanzania to the east and southeast , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west ; Lake Tanganyika lies along its southwestern border . The capital is Bujumbura . The Twa , Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years . For more than 200 of those years , Burundi was an independent kingdom , until the beginning of the 20th century , when Germany colonised the region . After the First World War and Germany 's defeat , it ceded the territory to Belgium . Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi . Despite common misconceptions , Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation . Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy , but a series of assassinations , coups and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966 . Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the economy undeveloped and the population as one of the world 's poorest . The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi , both Hutus , died together when their aeroplane was shot down in April 1994 . 2015 witnessed large-scale political strife as President Pierre Nkurunziza opted to run for a third term in office , a coup attempt failed and the country 's parliamentary and presidential elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community .",
  "/wiki/Ghana": "Ghana ( /\u02c8\u0261\u0251\u02d0n\u0259/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Ghana , is a country located along the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean , in the subregion of West Africa . Spanning a land mass of 238,535 km2 ( 92,099 sq mi ) , Ghana is bordered by the Ivory Coast in the west , Burkina Faso in the north , Togo in the east , and the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean in the south . Ghana means Warrior King in the Soninke language . The first permanent state in the territory of present-day Ghana dates back to the 11th century . Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries , of which the most powerful was the Kingdom of Ashanti . Beginning in the 15th century , numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights , with the British ultimately established control of the coast by the late 19th century . Following over a century of native resistance , Ghana 's current borders were established by the 1900s as the British Gold Coast . It became independent of the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957 . Ghana 's population of approximately 30 million spans a variety of ethnic , linguistic and religious groups . According to the 2010 census , 71.2% of the population was Christian , 17.6% was Muslim , and 5.2% practised traditional faiths . Its diverse geography and ecology ranges from coastal savannahs to tropical rain forests . Ghana is a unitary constitutional democracy led by a president who is both head of state and head of the government ."
