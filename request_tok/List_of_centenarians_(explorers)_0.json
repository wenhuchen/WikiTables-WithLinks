Unlike most sports , mountaineering lacks widely-applied formal rules , regulations , and governance ; mountaineers adhere to a large variety of techniques and philosophies when climbing mountains . Numerous local alpine clubs support mountaineers by hosting resources and social activities . A federation of alpine clubs , the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation ( UIAA ) , is the International Olympic Committee-recognized world organization for mountaineering and climbing .",

  "/wiki/Anarchism": "Anarchism is a radical political movement that is highly skeptical towards authority and rejects all forms of unjust hierarchy . It calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable , unnecessary , and harmful . Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies or other forms of free associations . Anarchism 's timeline stretches back to prehistory when people lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states , kingdoms or empires . With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies , skepticism towards authority also rose , but it was not until the 19th century a self-conscious political movement was formed . During the latest half of 19th and the first decades of 20th century , the anarchist movement flourished to most parts of the world , and had a significant role in worker 's struggles for emancipation . Various branches of anarchism were espoused during those times . Anarchists took part in several revolutions , most notably in the Spanish Civil War , where they were crushed by the fascists forces in 1939 , marking the end of the classical era of anarchism . In the latest decades of the 20th century , the anarchist movement nonetheless became relevant and vivid once more . Anarchism employ various tactics in order to meet their ideal ends ; these can be broadly separated in revolutionary and evolutionary tactics . There is significant overlap between the two legs which are merely descriptive . Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state , and have taken a violent turn in the past .",
  "/wiki/Spiritualism": "Spiritualism is a religious movement based on the belief that the spirits of the dead exist and have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living . The afterlife , or the spirit world , is seen by spiritualists , not as a static place , but as one in which spirits continue to evolve . These two beliefs - that contact with spirits is possible , and that spirits are more advanced than humans - lead spiritualists to a third belief : that spirits are capable of providing useful knowledge about moral and ethical issues , as well as about the nature of God . Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as spirit guides - specific spirits , often contacted , who are relied upon for spiritual guidance . Spiritism , a branch of spiritualism developed by Allan Kardec and today practiced mostly in Continental Europe and Latin America , especially in Brazil , emphasizes reincarnation . Spiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s , especially in English-speaking countries . By 1897 , spiritualism was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe , mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes . Spiritualism flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization , attaining cohesion through periodicals , tours by trance lecturers , camp meetings , and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums . Many prominent spiritualists were women , and like most spiritualists , supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women 's suffrage . By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud perpetrated by mediums , and formal spiritualist organizations began to appear . Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational spiritualist churches in the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Buddhism": "Buddhism ( /\u02c8b\u028ad\u026az\u0259m/ , US : /\u02c8bu\u02d0d-/ ) is the world 's fourth-largest religion with over 520 million followers , or over 7% of the global population , known as Buddhists . [ web 1 ] Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies . It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE , spreading through much of Asia . Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars : Theravada ( Pali : The School of the Elders ) and Mahayana ( Sanskrit : The Great Vehicle ) . Most Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth , either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood . Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation , the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts , and their specific teachings and practices . Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha , the Dharma and the Sangha , observance of moral precepts , monasticism , meditation , and the cultivation of the Paramitas ( perfections , or virtues ) . Theravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar and Thailand . Mahayana , which includes the traditions of Pure Land , Zen , Nichiren Buddhism , Shingon and Tiantai ( Tendai ) , is found throughout East Asia . Vajrayana , a body of teachings attributed to Indian adepts , may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of Mahayana Buddhism . Tibetan Buddhism , which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India , is practised in the countries of the Himalayan region , Mongolia , and Kalmykia .",

In human history , its most dramatic rise was during the Age of Discovery when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons . Since then , major explorations after the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery . In scientific research , exploration is one of three purposes of empirical research ( the other two being description and explanation ) . The term is often used metaphorically . For example , an individual may speak of exploring the Internet , etc .",

He was a man of talent and accomplishment , but his love of self-promotion and refusal to let the truth get in the way of a good story leave some aspects of his life in mystery . At various times Waldeck said that he was born in Paris , Prague , or Vienna , and at other times claimed to be a German , Austrian and British citizen . He often claimed the title of Count and occasionally that of Duke or Baron , but these can not be verified . Waldeck said he had traveled to South Africa at age 19 and thereafter had begun a career in exploration . He claimed to have returned to France and studied art as a student of Jacques-Louis David . He said he had traveled to Egypt with Napoleon 's expedition . None of this has been independently verified ; indeed most of Waldeck 's autobiography before about 1820 ( including his given birthdate ) is undocumented and his name is absent from records of various early expeditions he claimed to have been on . Waldeck is remembered primarily for two actions . The first is republishing the notorious set of pornographic prints titled I Modi . The second is the exploration of Mexico and the publication of many examples of Maya and Aztec sculpture ."
