  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

After a long period of stability , the conference 's overall athletic prowess began to decline throughout the 1980s , due in part to numerous member schools violating NCAA recruiting rules , culminating in the suspension of the entire SMU football program ( death penalty ) for the 1987 and 1988 seasons . Arkansas , after years of feeling like an outsider in the conference , left after the 1990-91 school year to join the Southeastern Conference , although they did compete in the SWC in football for the 1991 season . Five years later , the conference precipitously broke up as Baylor , Texas , Texas A & M , and Texas Tech ( which had entered in 1956 ) combined with the members of the former Big Eight Conference to form a new league , the Big 12 Conference , while Rice , SMU , TCU , and Houston ( which entered the SWC in 1976 ) found homes in less prominent conferences ( although TCU later joined the Big 12 ) .",

  "/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",

While the term was in use as early as 1933 , it became official only after the formation of the NCAA Division I athletic conference in 1954 . Seven of the eight schools were founded during the colonial period ( Cornell was founded in 1865 ) , and thus account for seven of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution .
