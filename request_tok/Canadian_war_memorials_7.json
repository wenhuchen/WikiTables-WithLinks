Kandahar is located in the south of the country on the Arghandab River , at an elevation of 1,010 m ( 3,310 ft ) . It is the capital of Kandahar Province , and also the center of the larger cultural region called Loy Kandahar . In 1709 , Mirwais Hotak made the region an independent kingdom and turned Kandahar into the capital of the Hotak dynasty . In 1747 , Ahmad Shah Durrani , founder of the Durrani dynasty , made Kandahar the capital of the Afghan Empire . Kandahar is one of the most culturally significant cities of the Pashtuns and has been their traditional seat of power for more than 300 years . It is a major trading center for sheep , wool , cotton , silk , felt , food grains , fresh and dried fruit , and tobacco . The region produces fine fruits , especially pomegranates and grapes , and the city has plants for canning , drying , and packing fruit , and is a major source of marijuana and hashish en route to Tajikistan . The region around Kandahar is one of the oldest known human settlements . A major fortified city existed at the site of Kandahar , probably as early as c. 1000-750 BCE , and it became an important outpost of the Achaemenid ( Persian ) Empire in the 6th century BCE . Alexander the Great had laid-out the foundation of what is now Old Kandahar in the 4th century BC and gave it the Ancient Greek name \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 A\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 ( Alexandria of Arachosia ) .

  "/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u2013present)": "The War in Afghanistan ( also called the US War in Afghanistan , Afghanistan War , or Fourth Anglo-Afghan War ) , code named Operation Enduring Freedom ( 2001-14 ) and Operation Freedom 's Sentinel ( 2015-present ) , following the United States invasion of Afghanistan of 7 October 2001 , when the United States of America and its allies successfully drove the Taliban from power in order to deny al-Qaeda a safe base of operations in Afghanistan . Since the initial objectives were completed , a coalition of over 40 countries ( including all NATO members ) formed a security mission in the country . The war has since mostly involved US and allied Afghan government troops battling Taliban insurgents . The war in Afghanistan is the longest war in US history . Following the September 11 attacks in 2001 on the US , which President George W. Bush blamed on Osama bin Laden who was living or hiding in Afghanistan and had already been wanted since 1998 , President Bush demanded that the Taliban , who were de facto ruling the country , hand over bin Laden . The Taliban declined to extradite him unless they were provided clear evidence of his involvement in the attacks , which the US refused to provide and dismissed as a delaying tactic and then on 7 October 2001 launched Operation Enduring Freedom with the United Kingdom . To justify the War , the Bush administration claimed that Afghanistan only had selective sovereignty , and that intervention was necessary because the Taliban threatened the sovereignty of other states . The two were later joined by other forces , including the Northern Alliance - the Afghan opposition which had been fighting the Taliban in the ongoing civil war since 1996 . By December 2001 , the Taliban and their al-Qaeda allies were mostly defeated in the country , and at the Bonn Conference new Afghan interim authorities ( mostly from the Northern Alliance ) elected Hamid Karzai to head the Afghan Interim Administration . The United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) to assist the new authority with securing Kabul , which after a 2002 loya jirga ( grand assembly ) became the Afghan Transitional Administration . A nationwide rebuilding effort was also made following the end of the totalitarian Taliban regime . In the popular elections of 2004 , Karzai was elected president of the country , now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan .",
  "/wiki/Inukshuk": "An inuksuk ( plural inuksuit ) ( from the Inuktitut : \u1403\u14c4\u1483\u14f1\u1483 , plural \u1403\u14c4\u1483\u14f1\u1403\u1466 ; alternatively inukhuk in Inuinnaqtun , i\u00f1uksuk in I\u00f1upiaq , inussuk in Greenlandic , and sometimes inukshuk in English ) is a manmade stone landmark or cairn built for use by the Inuit , I\u00f1upiat , Kalaallit , Yupik , and other peoples of the Arctic region of North America . These structures are found in northern Canada , Greenland , and Alaska ( United States ) . This combined region , above the Arctic Circle , is dominated by the tundra biome and has areas with few natural landmarks . The inuksuk may historically have been used for navigation , as a point of reference , a marker for travel routes , fishing places , camps , hunting grounds , places of veneration , drift fences used in hunting , or to mark a food cache . The I\u00f1upiat in northern Alaska used inuksuit to assist in the herding of caribou into contained areas for slaughter . Varying in shape and size , the inuksuit have ancient roots in Inuit culture . Historically , the most common types of inuksuk are built with stone placed upon stone . The simplest type is a single stone positioned in an upright manner . There is some debate as to whether the appearance of human- or cross-shaped cairns developed in the Inuit culture before the arrival of European missionaries and explorers . [ citation needed ] The size of some inuksuit suggest that the construction was often a communal effort . At Inuksuk Point ( Enukso Point ) on Baffin Island , there are more than 100 inuksuit . The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1969 .",

ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and the surrounding areas from the Taliban , al Qaeda and factional warlords , to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai . In October 2003 , the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan , and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country . From 2006 to 2011 , ISAF became increasingly involved in more intensive combat operations in southern and eastern Afghanistan . Troop contributors included the United States , United Kingdom , Canada , and other NATO member states as well as a number of other countries . The intensity of the combat faced by contributing nations varied greatly , with the United States sustaining the most casualties overall . In early 2010 , there were at least 700 military bases inside Afghanistan . About 400 of these were used by American - led NATO forces and 300 by the ANSF .

The chief institutions of the organisation are the Commonwealth Secretariat , which focuses on intergovernmental aspects , and the Commonwealth Foundation , which focuses on non-governmental relations between member states . The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of the 20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories . It was originally created as the British Commonwealth of Nations through the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference , and formalised by the United Kingdom through the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . The current Commonwealth of Nations was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which modernised the community and established the member states as free and equal . The human symbol of this free association is the Head of the Commonwealth , currently Queen Elizabeth II , and the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting appointed Charles , Prince of Wales to be her designated successor , although the position is not technically hereditary . The Queen is the head of state of 16 member states , known as the Commonwealth realms , while 33 other members are republics and five others have different monarchs . Member states have no legal obligations to one another , but are connected through their use of the English language and historical ties . Their stated shared values of democracy , human rights and the rule of law are enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter and promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games .

  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region .

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel . After the first two months of war , South Korean Army ( ROKA ) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat . As a result , the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter .",
