  "/wiki/Anglican_Church": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",

  "/wiki/Pharmacologist": "Pharmacology is the branch of pharmaceutical sciences which is concerned with the study of drug or medication action , where a drug can be broadly or narrowly defined as any man-made , natural , or endogenous ( from within the body ) molecule which exerts a biochemical or physiological effect on the cell , tissue , organ , or organism ( sometimes the word pharmacon is used as a term to encompass these endogenous and exogenous bioactive species ) . More specifically , it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function . If substances have medicinal properties , they are considered pharmaceuticals . The field encompasses drug composition and properties , synthesis and drug design , molecular and cellular mechanisms , organ/systems mechanisms , signal transduction/cellular communication , molecular diagnostics , interactions , chemical biology , therapy , and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities . The two main areas of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics . Pharmacodynamics studies the effects of a drug on biological systems , and pharmacokinetics studies the effects of biological systems on a drug . In broad terms , pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with biological receptors , and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption , distribution , metabolism , and excretion ( ADME ) of chemicals from the biological systems . Pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are frequently confused . Pharmacology , a biomedical science , deals with the research , discovery , and characterization of chemicals which show biological effects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to these chemicals . In contrast , pharmacy , a health services profession , is concerned with the application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings ; whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role . In either field , the primary contrast between the two is their distinctions between direct-patient care , pharmacy practice , and the science-oriented research field , driven by pharmacology .",

The nature of the role varies in importance depending on the nature of the collegiate university . At loosely federated universities such as the University of London , each college is self-governing and the head of a college acts much like a vice-chancellor .
