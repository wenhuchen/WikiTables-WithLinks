  "/wiki/Public_Policy": "Public policy is the process by which governments translate their political vision into programmes and actions to deliver outcomes - desired changes in the real world . The real world is constantly changing and this has resulted in the movement towards greater use of evidence in policy design , making and implementation . Rational choice theory , or now more frequently known as evidence-based policy , argues that focusing on scientific evidence , instead of history and culture , should guide our public policy making .",
  "/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize": "The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Swedish industrialist , inventor , and armaments manufacturer Alfred Nobel , along with the prizes in Chemistry , Physics , Physiology or Medicine , and Literature . Since March 1901 , it has been awarded annually ( with some exceptions ) to those who have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations , for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses . Per Alfred Nobel 's will , the recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee , a five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway . Since 1990 , the prize is awarded on 10 December in Oslo City Hall each year . The prize was formerly awarded in the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law ( 1947-1989 ) , the Norwegian Nobel Institute ( 1905-1946 ) , and the Parliament ( 1901-1904 ) . Due to its political nature , the Nobel Peace Prize has , for most of its history , been the subject of numerous controversies .",

  "/wiki/Sociology": "Sociology is a study of society , patterns of social relationships , social interaction and culture of everyday life . It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order , acceptance , and change or social evolution . Sociology is also defined as the general science of society . While some sociologists conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare , others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes . Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure . The different traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification , social class , social mobility , religion , secularization , law , sexuality , gender , and deviance . As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency , sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects , such as health , medical , economy , military and penal institutions , the Internet , education , social capital , and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge . The range of social scientific methods has also expanded . Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques . The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-20th century led to increasingly interpretative , hermeneutic , and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society . Conversely , the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically , mathematically , and computationally rigorous techniques , such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis . Social research informs politicians and policy makers , educators , planners , legislators , administrators , developers , business magnates , managers , social workers , non-governmental organizations , non-profit organizations , and people interested in resolving social issues in general .",

  "/wiki/Science_Policy": "Science policy is concerned with the allocation of resources for the conduct of science towards the goal of best serving the public interest . Topics include the funding of science , the careers of scientists , and the translation of scientific discoveries into technological innovation to promote commercial product development , competitiveness , economic growth and economic development . Science policy focuses on knowledge production and role of knowledge networks , collaborations and the complex distributions of expertise , equipment and know-how . Understanding the processes and organizational context of generating novel and innovative science and engineering ideas is a core concern of science policy . Science policy topics include weapons development , health care and environmental monitoring . Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve science . A large and complex web of factors influences the development of science and engineering that includes government science policy makers , private firms ( including both national and multi-national firms ) , social movements , media , non-governmental organizations , universities , and other research institutions . In addition , science policy is increasingly international as defined by the global operations of firms and research institutions as well as by the collaborative networks of non-governmental organizations and of the nature of scientific inquiry itself .",

  "/wiki/Philosophy": "Philosophy ( from Greek \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 , philosophia , literally love of wisdom ) is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence , knowledge , values , reason , mind , and language . Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved . The term was probably coined by Pythagoras ( c. 570 - 495 BCE ) . Philosophical methods include questioning , critical discussion , rational argument , and systematic presentation . Classic philosophical questions include : Is it possible to know anything and to prove it ? What is most real ? Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such as : Is there a best way to live ? Is it better to be just or unjust ( if one can get away with it ) ? Do humans have free will ? Historically , philosophy encompassed any body of knowledge . From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century , natural philosophy encompassed astronomy , medicine , and physics . For example , Newton 's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics .",
  "/wiki/Political_Science": "Political science , occasionally called politology , is a social science which deals with systems of governance , and the analysis of political activities , political thoughts , and political behavior . Political science comprises numerous subfields , including comparative politics , political economy , international relations , political theory , public administration , public policy , and political methodology . Furthermore , political science is related to , and draws upon , the fields of economics , law , sociology , history , philosophy , geography , psychology/psychiatry , anthropology and neurosciences . Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of constitutions , political actors , legislature and associated fields , all of them from an intrastate perspective . International relations deals with the interaction between nation-states as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations . Political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers . Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in psychology , social research and cognitive neuroscience . Approaches include positivism , interpretivism , rational choice theory , behavioralism , structuralism , post-structuralism , realism , institutionalism , and pluralism . Political science , as one of the social sciences , uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought : primary sources such as historical documents and official records , secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles , survey research , statistical analysis , case studies , experimental research , and model building .",
  "/wiki/Urban_and_Regional_Planning": "Urban planning is a technical and political process concerned with the development and design of land use and the built environment , including air , water , and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas , such as transportation , communications , and distribution networks . Urban planning deals with physical layout of human settlements . The primary concern is the public welfare , which includes considerations of efficiency , sanitation , protection and use of the environment , as well as effects on social and economic activities . Urban planning is considered an interdisciplinary field that includes social science , engineering and design sciences . It is closely related to the field of urban design and some urban planners provide designs for streets , parks , buildings and other urban areas . Urban planning is also referred to as urban and regional planning , regional planning , town planning , city planning , rural planning , urban development or some combination in various areas worldwide . Urban planning guides orderly development in urban , suburban and rural areas . Although predominantly concerned with the planning of settlements and communities , urban planning is also responsible for the planning and development of water use and resources , rural and agricultural land , parks and conserving areas of natural environmental significance . Practitioners of urban planning are concerned with research and analysis , strategic thinking , architecture , urban design , public consultation , policy recommendations , implementation and management . Enforcement methodologies include governmental zoning , planning permissions , and building codes , as well as private easements and restrictive covenants . Urban planners work with the cognate fields of architecture , landscape architecture , civil engineering , and public administration to achieve strategic , policy and sustainability goals . Early urban planners were often members of these cognate fields .",
  "/wiki/Regional_planning": "Regional planning deals with the efficient placement of land-use activities , infrastructure , and settlement growth across a larger area of land than an individual city or town . Regional planning is related to urban planning as it relates land use practices on a broader scale . It also includes formulating laws that will guide the efficient planning and management of such said regions . Regional planning can be comprehensive by covering various subjects , but it more often specifies a particular subject , which requires region-wide consideration . Regions require various land uses ; protection of farmland , cities , industrial space , transportation hubs and infrastructure , military bases , and wilderness . Regional planning is the science of efficient placement of infrastructure and zoning for the sustainable growth of a region . Advocates for regional planning such as new urbanist Peter Calthorpe , promote the approach because it can address region-wide environmental , social , and economic issues which may necessarily require a regional focus . A region in planning terms can be administrative or at least partially functional , and is likely to include a network of settlements and character areas . In most European countries , regional and national plans are spatial directing certain levels of development to specific cities and towns in order to support and manage the region depending on specific needs , for example supporting or resisting polycentrism .",
