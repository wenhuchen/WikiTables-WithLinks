  "/wiki/Record_Label": "A record label , or record company , is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos . Sometimes , a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks , coordinates the production , manufacture , distribution , marketing , promotion , and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos , while also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists ( artists and repertoire or A & R ) , and maintaining contracts with recording artists and their managers . The term record label derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer 's name , along with other information . Within the mainstream music industry , recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base , market their albums , and be both promoted and heard on music streaming services , radio , and television .

Actor Michael Ironside reprised his role as Fisher , while Don Jordan returned from the original game to voice Third Echelon director Irving Lambert and Claudia Besso returned as hacker and analyst Anna Gr\u00edmsd\u00f3ttir having both been replaced by Dennis Haysbert and Adriana Anderson respectively in Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow .
