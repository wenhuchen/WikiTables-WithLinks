  "/wiki/Casing_(sausage)": "Sausage casing , also known as sausage skin or simply casing , is the material that encloses the filling of a sausage . Natural casings are made from animal intestines or skin ; artificial casings , introduced in the early 20th century , are made of collagen and cellulose . The material is then shaped via a continuous extrusion process -- producing a single sausage casing of indefinite length -- which is then cut into desired lengths , usually while the extrusion process continues .",
  "/wiki/Rostbr\u00e4tel": "A Rostbr\u00e4tel is a marinated cutlet of pork neck , that 's grilled over charcoal . It is , like Thuringian sausage ( Rostbratwurst ) , a Thuringian specialty . The label Rostbr\u00e4tel is common in West Thuringia and South Thuringia . For preparation , about an inch cut of pork neck cutlet ( with or without bone ) is pressed ( tenderized ) and marinated in salt , pepper , Thuringian spicy mustard , onions and beer for two to up to 24 hours . The beer should be a dark , strong , somewhat sweet kind , not a Pilsener , as this adds a bitter taste . In some recipes , garlic and Caraway Seed are added as further spices . Cooking is done on a charcoal grill . The grates are greased with pork fat , bacon , oil , butter or cooking spray in order to prevent sticking . While the meat is gently cooked over light to medium heat , it is basted after every turn with the marinade or with beer , sprayed directly from a gently shaken bottle . This serves to improve the taste and prevents a drying of the meat on the cooking surface . Moreover , the cooking temperature is regulated by gently spraying beer directly on the charcoal ; the rising steam helps to cook and flavour the meat . It is served with caramelized onions and a good German beer .",
  "/wiki/Onions": "The onion ( Allium cepa L. , from Latin cepa onion ) , also known as the bulb onion or common onion , is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium . Its close relatives include the garlic , shallot , leek , chive , and Chinese onion . This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food , such as the Japanese bunching onion ( Allium fistulosum ) , the tree onion ( A . \u00d7proliferum ) , and the Canada onion ( Allium canadense ) . The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species , but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation . Its ancestral wild original form is not known , although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions . The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant , but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season . The onion plant has a fan of hollow , bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached . The bulbs are composed of shortened , compressed , underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale ( leaves ) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem . In the autumn ( or in spring , in the case of overwintering onions ) , the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle . The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage . The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases , particularly the onion fly , the onion eelworm , and various fungi cause rotting .",
  "/wiki/Beer": "Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world . It is also the third most popular drink overall after water and tea . Beer is brewed from cereal grains - most commonly from malted barley , though wheat , maize ( corn ) , and rice are also used . During the brewing process , fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer . Most modern beer is brewed with hops , which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent . Other flavouring agents such as gruit , herbs , or fruits may be included or used instead of hops . In commercial brewing , the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation . Some of humanity 's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer : the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours , and The Hymn to Ninkasi , a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer , served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people . Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught , particularly in pubs and bars . The brewing industry is a global business , consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries . The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume ( ABV ) , although it may vary between 0.5% and 20% , with some breweries creating examples of 40% ABV and above . Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals , as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games .",
  "/wiki/Mustard_(condiment)": "Mustard is a condiment made from the seeds of a mustard plant ( white/yellow mustard , Sinapis alba ; brown mustard , Brassica juncea ; or black mustard , Brassica nigra ) . The whole , ground , cracked , or bruised mustard seeds are mixed with water , vinegar , lemon juice , wine , or other liquids , salt , and often other flavorings and spices , to create a paste or sauce ranging in color from bright yellow to dark brown . The taste of mustard ranges from sweet to spicy . Commonly paired with meats and cheeses , mustard is also added to sandwiches , hamburgers , corn dogs , and hot dogs . It is also used as an ingredient in many dressings , glazes , sauces , soups , and marinades . As a cream or as individual seeds , mustard is used as a condiment in the cuisine of India and Bangladesh , the Mediterranean , northern and southeastern Europe , Asia , the Americas , and Africa , making it one of the most popular and widely used spices and condiments in the world .",

Beef or veal is typically used , though some food scholars tend to believe that the original version was probably venison or pork , and pork is still popular in some areas . The beef rouladen as we know them today have become popular over the last century . The cut is usually topside beef or silverside since this is the cheaper cut . The more expensive version would be the round steak , also known as rump steak . The meat is cut into large , thin slices .

Trimmings , on the other hand , are usually mixed with meat from older , leaner ( therefore tougher ) cattle , are ground , minced or used in sausages . The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage . Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal , such as the oxtail , liver , tongue , tripe from the reticulum or rumen , glands ( particularly the pancreas and thymus , referred to as sweetbread ) , the heart , the brain ( although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy , BSE , commonly referred to as mad cow disease ) , the kidneys , and the tender testicles of the bull ( known in the United States as calf fries , prairie oysters , or Rocky Mountain oysters ) .

  "/wiki/Quark_(cheese)": "Quark or quarg is a type of fresh dairy product made by warming soured milk until the desired amount of curdling is met , and then straining it . It can be classified as fresh acid-set cheese . Traditional quark can be made without rennet , but in modern dairies small quantities of rennet are typically added . It is soft , white and unaged , and usually has no salt added . It is traditional in the cuisines of German-speaking , Slavic and Scandinavian countries . Dictionaries sometimes translate it as curd cheese , cottage cheese , farmer cheese or junket . In Germany , quark and cottage cheese are considered to be different types of fresh cheese , while in Eastern Europe cottage cheese is usually viewed as a type of quark ( e.g . Russian for cottage cheese is \u0437\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0451\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 zernyony tvorog , literally grainy quark ) . Quark is similar to French fromage blanc , Indian paneer , and the queso fresco/queijo fresco made in the Iberian Peninsula and in some Latin American countries . It is distinct from Italian ricotta because ricotta ( Italian recooked ) is made from scalded whey . Quark is somewhat similar to yogurt cheeses such as the South Asian chak ( k ) a , the Arabic labneh , and the Central Asian suzma or kashk , but while these products are obtained by straining yogurt ( milk fermented with thermophile bacteria ) , quark is made from soured milk fermented with mesophile bacteria .",
  "/wiki/Shortcrust_pastry": "Shortcrust pastry is a type of pastry often used for the base of a tart , quiche or pie . Shortcrust pastry can be used to make both sweet and savoury pies such as apple pie , quiche , lemon meringue or chicken pie . Shortcrust pastry recipes usually call for twice as much flour as fat by weight . Fat ( lard , shortening , butter or full-fat margarine ) is rubbed into plain flour to create a loose mixture that is then bound using a small amount of ice water , rolled out , then shaped and placed to create the top or bottom of a flan or meat pie . Often , equal amounts of butter and lard are used to make the pastry , ensuring that the ratio of the two fat products is half that of the flour . The butter is employed to give the pastry a rich flavor , while the lard ensures optimum texture .",
  "/wiki/Altenburg": "Altenburg ( listen ( help\u00b7info ) ) is a city in Thuringia , Germany , located 40 kilometres ( 25 miles ) south of Leipzig , 90 kilometres ( 56 miles ) west of Dresden and 100 kilometres ( 62 miles ) east of Erfurt . It is the capital of the Altenburger Land district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between Gera , Zwickau and Chemnitz with more than 1 million inhabitants , while the city itself has a population of 33,000 . Today , the city and its rural county is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region . Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area , east of the Saale river ( as part of the medieval Ostsiedlung movement ) . The emperor Frederick Barbarossa visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188 , hence the town is named a Barbarossa town today . Since the 17th century , Altenburg was the residence of different Ernestine duchies , of whom the Saxe-Altenburg persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918 . Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the Great Depression around 1930 . Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in East Germany and continued after German reunification in 1990 , evidenced by a decline in population , high unemployment and house vacancy rates . The main sights of Altenburg are the castle , the Lindenau-Museum , the historic city center ( most buildings are from early-modern origin ) and the Gr\u00fcnderzeit architecture around the center . The popular German card game Skat was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die , Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus , lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817 . Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of Osterland on the Plei\u00dfe river in the very east of Thuringia , next to the neighboring federal state of Saxony .",

  "/wiki/Weimar": "Weimar ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8va\u026ama\u0250\u032f ] ; Latin : Vimaria or Vinaria ) is a city in the federal state of Thuringia , Germany . It is located in Central Germany between Erfurt in the west and Jena in the east , approximately 80 kilometres ( 50 miles ) southwest of Leipzig , 170 kilometres ( 106 miles ) north of Nuremberg and 170 kilometres ( 106 miles ) west of Dresden . Together with the neighbour-cities Erfurt and Jena it forms the central metropolitan area of Thuringia with approximately 500,000 inhabitants , whereas the city itself counts a population of 65,000 . Weimar is well known because of its large cultural heritage and its importance in German history . The city was a focal point of the German Enlightenment and home of the leading personalities of the literary genre of Weimar Classicism , the writers Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller . In the 19th century , famous composers like Franz Liszt made Weimar a music centre and later , artists and architects like Henry van de Velde , Wassily Kandinsky , Paul Klee , Lyonel Feininger and Walter Gropius came to the city and founded the Bauhaus movement , the most important German design school of the interwar period . However , the political history of 20th-century Weimar was inconsistent : it was the place where Germany 's first democratic constitution was signed after the First World War , giving its name to the Weimar Republic period in German politics ( 1918-33 ) , as well as one of the cities mythologized by the National Socialist propaganda . Until 1948 , Weimar was the capital of Thuringia . Today , many places in the city centre have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites ( either as part of the Weimar Classicism complex or as part of the Bauhaus complex ) and tourism is one of the leading economic sectors of Weimar . Relevant institutions in Weimar are the Bauhaus University , the Liszt School of Music , the Duchess Anna Amalia Library and two leading courts of Thuringia ( the Supreme Administrative Court and Constitutional Court ) . In 1999 , Weimar was the European Capital of Culture ."
