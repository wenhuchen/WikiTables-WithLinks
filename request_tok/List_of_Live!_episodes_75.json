  "/wiki/Public": "In public relations and communication science , publics are groups of individual people , and the public ( a.k.a . the general public ) is the totality of such groupings . This is a different concept to the sociological concept of the \u00d6ffentlichkeit or public sphere . The concept of a public has also been defined in political science , psychology , marketing , and advertising . In public relations and communication science , it is one of the more ambiguous concepts in the field . Although it has definitions in the theory of the field that have been formulated from the early 20th century onwards , it has suffered in more recent years from being blurred , as a result of conflation of the idea of a public with the notions of audience , market segment , community , constituency , and stakeholder . The name public originates with the Latin publicus ( also poplicus ) , from populus , to the English word 'populace ' , and in general denotes some mass population ( the people ) in association with some matter of common interest . So in political science and history , a public is a population of individuals in association with civic affairs , or affairs of office or state . In social psychology , marketing , and public relations , a public has a more situational definition . John Dewey defined ( Dewey 1927 ) public as a group of people who , in facing a similar problem , recognize it and organize themselves to address it . Dewey 's definition of a public is thus situational : people organized about a situation . Built upon this situational definition of a public is the situational theory of publics by James E. Grunig ( Grunig 1983 ) , which talks of nonpublics ( who have no problem ) , latent publics ( who have a problem ) , aware publics ( who recognize that they have a problem ) , and active publics ( who do something about their problem ) .",

Located in the inner-city area of Saint-Michel , it was founded in Baie-Saint-Paul on 16 June 1984 by former street performers Guy Lalibert\u00e9 and Gilles Ste-Croix . Originating as a performing troupe called Les \u00c9chassiers ( [ lez\u203fe.\u0283a.sje ] , The Waders ) , they toured Quebec in various forms between 1979 and 1983 . Their initial financial hardship was relieved in 1983 by a government grant from the Canada Council for the Arts to perform as part of the 450th anniversary celebrations of Jacques Cartier 's voyage to Canada . Their first official production Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success in 1984 , and after securing a second year of funding , Lalibert\u00e9 hired Guy Caron from the National Circus School to recreate it as a proper circus . Its theatrical , character-driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus ( nouveau cirque ) that it remains today . After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s , Nouvelle Exp\u00e9rience was created - with the direction of Franco Dragone - which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990 , but allowed it to create new shows . Cirque du Soleil expanded rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s , growing from one show to 19 shows in over 300 cities on every continent except Antarctica . The company employs 4,900 people from 50 countries and generates an annual revenue of approximately US $ 1 billion . The multiple permanent Las Vegas shows alone play to more than 9,000 people a night , 5% of the city 's visitors , adding to the over 100 million people who have seen Cirque du Soleil productions worldwide . In 2000 , Lalibert\u00e9 bought out Daniel Gauthier , and with 95% ownership continued to expand the brand . In 2008 , Lalibert\u00e9 split 20% of his share equally between the investment groups Istithmar World and Nakheel of Dubai in order to further finance the company 's goals .",
