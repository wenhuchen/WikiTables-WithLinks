  "/wiki/Caseless_ammunition": "Caseless ammunition is a type of small arms ammunition that eliminates the cartridge case that typically holds the primer , propellant , and projectile together as a unit . Caseless ammunition is an attempt to reduce the weight and cost of ammunition by dispensing with the case , which is typically precision made of brass or steel , as well as to simplify the operation of repeating firearms by eliminating the need to extract and eject the empty case after firing . Its acceptance has been hampered by problems with production expenses , heat sensitivity , sealing , and fragility . Its use to date has been mainly limited to prototypes and low-powered firearms , with some exceptions .",
  "/wiki/Cloaking_device": "A cloaking device is a hypothetical or fictional stealth technology that can cause objects , such as spaceships or individuals , to be partially or wholly invisible to parts of the electromagnetic ( EM ) spectrum . However , over the entire spectrum , a cloaked object scatters more than an uncloaked object . Fictional cloaking devices have been used as plot devices in various media for many years . Developments in scientific research show that real-world cloaking devices can obscure objects from at least one wavelength of EM emissions . Scientists already use artificial materials called metamaterials to bend light around an object .",

  "/wiki/Electrolaser": "An electrolaser is a type of electroshock weapon that is also a directed-energy weapon . It uses lasers to form an electrically conductive laser-induced plasma channel ( LIPC ) . A fraction of a second later , a powerful electric current is sent down this plasma channel and delivered to the target , thus functioning overall as a large-scale , high energy , long-distance version of the Taser electroshock gun . Alternating current is sent through a series of step-up transformers , increasing the voltage and decreasing the current . The final voltage may be between 108 and 109 volts . [ citation needed ] This current is fed into the plasma channel created by the laser beam .",

  "/wiki/Electrothermal-chemical_technology": "Electrothermal-chemical ( ETC ) technology is an attempt to increase accuracy and muzzle energy of future tank , artillery , and close-in weapon system guns by improving the predictability and rate of expansion of propellants inside the barrel . An electrothermal-chemical gun uses a plasma cartridge to ignite and control the ammunition 's propellant , using electrical energy to trigger the process . ETC increases the performance of conventional solid propellants , reduces the effect of temperature on propellant expansion and allows for more advanced , higher density propellants to be used . The technology has been under development since the mid-1980s and at present is actively being researched in the United States by the Army Research Laboratory , Sandia National Laboratories and defense industry contractors , including FMC Corporation , General Dynamics Land Systems , Olin Ordnance , and Soreq Nuclear Research Center . It is possible that electrothermal-chemical gun propulsion will be an integral part of US Army 's future combat system and those of other countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom . Electrothermal-chemical technology is part of a broad research and development program that encompasses all electric gun technology , such as railguns and coil guns .",
  "/wiki/Force_shield": "In speculative fiction , a force field , sometimes known as an energy shield , force shield , force bubble , defence shield or deflector shield , is a barrier made of energy , plasma , or particles . It protects a person , area , or object from attacks or intrusions . This fictional technology is created as a field of energy without mass that acts as a wall , so that objects affected by the particular force relating to the field are unable to pass through the field and reach the other side . This concept has become a staple of many science-fiction works , so much that authors frequently do not even bother to explain or justify them to their readers , treating them almost as established fact and attributing whatever capabilities the plot requires . There is ongoing scientific research into real force fields , primarily to protect against radiation . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Green_bullet": "Green bullet , green ammunition or green ammo are nicknames for a United States Department of Defense program to eliminate the use of hazardous materials from small arms ammunition and from small arms ammunition manufacturing . Initial objectives were elimination of ozone-depleting substances , volatile organic compounds , and heavy metals from primers and projectiles . These materials were perceived as causing difficulties through the entire life cycle of ammunition . The materials generated hazardous wastes and emissions at manufacturing facilities and use of ammunition caused contamination at shooting ranges . Potential health hazards made demilitarization and disposal of unused ammunition difficult and expensive . The Joint Working Group for Non-Toxic Ammunition was formed by the Small Caliber Ammunition Branch of the United States Army Armament Research , Development and Engineering Center in October 1995 . Members of the working group included the National Guard of the United States , the United States Coast Guard , the United States Army Infantry School , the Industrial Operations Command , the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant , the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the United States Department of Energy Kansas City Plant .",
  "/wiki/Laser_weapon": "A laser weapon is a directed-energy weapon based on lasers . After decades of R & D , as of January 2020 [ update ] directed-energy weapons including lasers are still at the experimental stage and it remains to be seen if or when they will be deployed as practical , high-performance military weapons . Atmospheric thermal blooming has been a major problem , still mostly unsolved and worsened if there is fog , smoke , dust , rain , snow , smog , foam or purposely dispersed obscurant chemicals in the air . Essentially , laser generates a beam of light which needs clear air to work or a vacuum to work without thermal blooming . Laser and other directed-energy weapons have been a staple in science fiction since their inception however . Many types of laser can potentially be used as incapacitating weapons , through their ability to produce temporary or permanent vision loss when aimed at the eyes . The degree , character , and duration of vision impairment caused by eye exposure to laser light varies with the power of the laser , the wavelength ( s ) , the collimation of the beam , the exact orientation of the beam , and the duration of exposure . Lasers of even a fraction of a watt in power can produce immediate , permanent vision loss under certain conditions , making such lasers potential non-lethal but incapacitating weapons . The extreme handicap that laser-induced blindness represents makes the use of lasers even as non-lethal weapons morally controversial , and weapons designed to cause permanent blindness have been banned by the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons . Weapons designed to cause temporary blindness , known as dazzlers , are used by military and sometimes law enforcement organizations . Incidents of pilots being exposed to lasers while flying have prompted aviation authorities to implement special procedures to deal with such hazards . See Lasers and aviation safety for more on this topic .",
  "/wiki/MAHEM": "The Magneto Hydrodynamic Explosive Munition ( MAHEM ) is a weapon being developed by DARPA that would utilize molten metal to penetrate enemy armor . The molten metal would be propelled by electromagnetic fields from explosions . The munition would be delivered to a target as a warhead packaged into a missile , projectile or other platform . It would penetrate the armor of an enemy vehicle then explode when it gets inside , destroying the vehicle from the inside out . DARPA predicts the weapon will have greater efficiency , control , and precision than conventional explosively formed penetrators . It is driven by a compressed magnetic flux generator ( CMFG ) .",
  "/wiki/Particle_beam_weapon": "A particle-beam weapon uses a high-energy beam of atomic or subatomic particles to damage the target by disrupting its atomic and/or molecular structure . A particle-beam weapon is a type of directed-energy weapon , which directs energy in a particular and focused direction using particles with minuscule mass . Some particle-beam weapons have potential practical applications , e.g . as an antiballistic missile defense system for the United States and its cancelled Strategic Defense Initiative . They have been known by myriad names : phasers , disruptors , particle accelerator guns , ion cannons , proton beams , lightning rays , rayguns , etc . The concept of particle-beam weapons comes from sound scientific principles and experiments currently underway around the world . One effective process to cause damage to or destroy a target is to simply overheat it until it is no longer operational . However , after decades of R & D , particle-beam weapons are still very much at the research stage and it remains to be seen if or when they will be deployed as practical , high-performance military weapons . Particle accelerators are a well-developed technology used in scientific research for decades . They use electromagnetic fields to accelerate and direct charged particles along a predetermined path , and electrostatic lenses to focus these streams for collisions . The cathode ray tube in many twentieth-century televisions and computer monitors is a very simple type of particle accelerator . More powerful versions include synchrotrons and cyclotrons used in nuclear research .",
  "/wiki/Plasma_weapon": "Strange and exotic weapons are a recurring feature in science fiction . In some cases , weapons first introduced in science fiction have been made a reality ; other science fiction weapons remain purely fictional , and are often beyond the realms of known physical possibility . At its most prosaic , science fiction features an endless variety of sidearms - mostly variations on real weapons such as guns and swords . Among the best-known of these are the phaser - used in the Star Trek television series , films and novels - and the lightsaber and blaster - featured in Star Wars movies , comics , novels and TV shows . Besides adding action and entertainment value , weaponry in science fiction sometimes touch on deeper concerns and become a theme , often motivated by contemporary issues . One example is science fiction that deals with weapons of mass destruction .",
  "/wiki/Pure_fusion_weapon": "A pure fusion weapon is a hypothetical hydrogen bomb design that does not need a fission primary explosive to ignite the fusion of deuterium and tritium , two heavy isotopes of hydrogen used in fission-fusion thermonuclear weapons . Such a weapon would require no fissile material and would therefore be much easier to develop in secret than existing weapons . The necessity of separating weapons grade uranium ( U-235 ) or breeding plutonium ( Pu-239 ) requires a substantial and difficult-to-conceal industrial investment , and blocking the sale and transfer of the needed machinery has been the primary mechanism to control nuclear proliferation to date .

  "/wiki/Sonic_weapon": "Sonic and ultrasonic weapons ( USW ) are weapons of various types that use sound to injure , incapacitate , or kill an opponent . Some sonic weapons are currently in limited use or in research and development by military and police forces . Some of these weapons have been described as sonic bullets , sonic grenades , sonic mines , or sonic cannons . Some make a focused beam of sound or ultrasound ; some make an area field of sound .",
  "/wiki/Stealth_technology": "Stealth technology , also termed low observable technology ( LO technology ) , is a sub-discipline of military tactics and passive and active electronic countermeasures , which covers a range of methods used to make personnel , aircraft , ships , submarines , missiles , satellites , and ground vehicles less visible ( ideally invisible ) to radar , infrared , sonar and other detection methods . It corresponds to military camouflage for these parts of the electromagnetic spectrum ( i.e. , multi-spectral camouflage ) . Development of modern stealth technologies in the United States began in 1958 , where earlier attempts to prevent radar tracking of its U-2 spy planes during the Cold War by the Soviet Union had been unsuccessful . Designers turned to developing a specific shape for planes that tended to reduce detection by redirecting electromagnetic radiation waves from radars . Radiation-absorbent material was also tested and made to reduce or block radar signals that reflect off the surfaces of aircraft . Such changes to shape and surface composition comprise stealth technology as currently used on the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber . The concept of stealth is to operate or hide while giving enemy forces no indication as to the presence of friendly forces . This concept was first explored through camouflage to make an object 's appearance blend into the visual background . As the potency of detection and interception technologies ( radar , infrared searching and tracking , surface-to-air missiles , etc . ) have increased , so too has the extent to which the design and operation of military personnel and vehicles have been affected in response . Some military uniforms are treated with chemicals to reduce their infrared signature . A modern stealth vehicle is designed from the outset to have a chosen spectral signature .",
  "/wiki/Electronic_countermeasures": "An electronic countermeasure ( ECM ) is an electrical or electronic device designed to trick or deceive radar , sonar or other detection systems , like infrared ( IR ) or lasers . It may be used both offensively and defensively to deny targeting information to an enemy . The system may make many separate targets appear to the enemy , or make the real target appear to disappear or move about randomly . It is used effectively to protect aircraft from guided missiles . Most air forces use ECM to protect their aircraft from attack . It has also been deployed by military ships and recently on some advanced tanks to fool laser/IR guided missiles . It is frequently coupled with stealth advances so that the ECM systems have an easier job . Offensive ECM often takes the form of jamming . Self-protecting ( defensive ) ECM includes using blip enhancement and jamming of missile terminal homers .",
  "/wiki/Vortex_ring_gun": "The vortex ring gun is an experimental non-lethal weapon for crowd control that uses high-energy vortex rings of gas to knock down people or spray them with marking ink or other chemicals . The concept was explored by the US Army starting in 1998 , and by some commercial firms . Knockdown of distant individuals currently seems unlikely even if the rings are launched at theoretical maximum speed . As for the delivery of chemicals , leakage during flight is still a problem . [ citation needed ] Weapons based on similar principles but different designs and purposes have been described before , typically using acetylene-air or hydrogen-oxygen explosions to create and propel the vortices .",
  "/wiki/XREP_Taser": "An electroshock weapon is an incapacitating weapon . It delivers an electric shock aimed at temporarily disrupting muscle functions and/or inflicting pain without causing significant injury . Many types of these devices exist . Stun guns , batons ( or prods ) , and belts administer an electric shock by direct contact , whereas Tasers ( conducted electrical weapons ) fire projectiles that administer the shock through thin flexible wires . Long-range electroshock projectiles , which can be fired from ordinary shotguns and do not need the wires , have also been developed . Though the two terms are often used interchangeably , stun guns are actually direct contact weapons that work mainly through pain compliance by affecting the sensory nervous system . It can also cause some muscular disruption , but that generally requires 3-5 seconds of direct contact . In comparison , the Taser is a long range weapon that incapacitates the target by disrupting voluntary muscular control through the motor nervous system ."
