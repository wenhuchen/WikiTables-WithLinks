In D & RG service it became No . 425 , but was renumbered No . 315 when the D & RG became the Denver and Rio Grande Western in the reorganization of 1924 . It began its D & RG service at Alamosa , Colorado , was leased to the Rio Grande Southern for 1926-27 and then spent most of the next decade on the Gunnison Division , in Salida , Colorado , on the line to Montrose and on the branch to Ouray . As larger locomotives , notably the K-27 K-36 and K-37 Mikados came on line , smaller engines like 315 were used as switchers or scrapped . No . 315 spent several periods in the shops in the early 1940s , notably with a broken main rod and then later for flue work and to replace its pilot with a switch engine pilot .
