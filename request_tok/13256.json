  "/wiki/Sportswriter": "Sports journalism is a form of writing that reports on matters pertaining to sporting topics and competitions . Sports Journalism started in the early 1800s when it was targeted to the social elite and has transitioned into an integral part of the news business with newspapers having dedicated sports sections . The increased popularity of sports amongst the middle and lower class led to the more coverage of sports content in publications . The appetite for sports resulted in sports only publications like ESPN and Sports Illustrated . There are many different forms of sports journalism , ranging from play by play and game recaps to analysis and investigative journalism on important developments in the sport . Technology and the internet age has massively changed the sports journalism space as it is struggling with the same problems that the broader category of print journalism is struggling with , mainly not being able to cover costs due to falling subscriptions .

  "/wiki/James_Branch_Cabell": "James Branch Cabell ( /\u02c8k\u00e6b\u0259l/ ; April 14 , 1879 - May 5 , 1958 ) was an American author of fantasy fiction and belles-lettres . Cabell was well-regarded by his contemporaries , including H. L. Mencken , Edmund Wilson , and Sinclair Lewis . His works were considered escapist and fit well in the culture of the 1920s , when they were most popular . For Cabell , veracity was the one unpardonable sin , not merely against art , but against human welfare . Although escapist , Cabell 's works are ironic and satirical . H. L. Mencken disputed Cabell 's claim to romanticism and characterized him as really the most acidulous of all the anti-romantics . His gaudy heroes . chase dragons precisely as stockbrockers play golf . Cabell saw art as an escape from life , but once the artist creates his ideal world , he finds that it is made up of the same elements that make the real one . Interest in Cabell declined in the 1930s , a decline that has been attributed in part to his failure to move out of his fantasy niche despite the onset of World War II . Alfred Kazin said that Cabell and Hitler did not inhabit the same universe .",

He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining , turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise . His humorous story , The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , was published in 1865 , based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp , California , where he had spent some time as a miner .
