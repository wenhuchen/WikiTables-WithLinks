  "/wiki/Travel_Man": "Travel Man is a British television travel documentary series . It features presenter Richard Ayoade , travelling to a popular city each episode with a celebrity guest . It was produced around the same time Ayoade was presenting Gadget Man . The style of the show is very fast paced , with bracing editing and a very dry sense of humour , led by Ayoade 's fourth-wall-breaking voice over ( he may refer to the fact that the voice over does n't do the city justice , that there 's just no time to describe it properly or that the cutaway shots were rather generic etc ) . There 's often a use of comical library music . Unlike Top Gear which evolved from a consumer advice show on cars into pure entertainment , Travel Man entertains and remains useful to viewers planning a trip . Onscreen pop-ups highlight various activities or places to visit and their cost , and the overall price of staying 48 hours in that week 's city is always mentioned at the end of each episode . Ayoade 's presentation style and banter with that week 's guest often emphasises his social inadequacies . He frequently uses the word shiz in his commentary . Travel Man has been twice nominated in the best Features category at the BAFTAs and won Best Factual Programme three years running at the RTS Midlands awards . In Australia , the series is broadcast on SBS Viceland , and in New Zealand on TVNZ Duke . In July 2019 , Channel 4 announced that Ayoade would be leaving the show after the tenth series and would be replaced as host by comedian Joe Lycett .",
