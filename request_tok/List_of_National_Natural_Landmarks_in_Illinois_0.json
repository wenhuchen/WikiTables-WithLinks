  "/wiki/Mass_wasting": "Mass wasting , also known as slope movement or mass movement , is the geomorphic process by which soil , sand , regolith , and rock move downslope typically as a solid , continuous or discontinuous mass , largely under the force of gravity , frequently with characteristics of a flow as in debris flows and mudflows . Types of mass wasting include creep , slides , flows , topples , and falls , each with its own characteristic features , and taking place over timescales from seconds to hundreds of years . Mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes , and has been observed on Earth , Mars , Venus , and Jupiter 's moon Io . When the gravitational force acting on a slope exceeds its resisting force , slope failure ( mass wasting ) occurs . The slope material 's strength and cohesion and the amount of internal friction within the material help maintain the slope 's stability and are known collectively as the slope 's shear strength . The steepest angle that a cohesionless slope can maintain without losing its stability is known as its angle of repose . When a slope made of loose material possesses this angle , its shear strength counterbalances the force of gravity acting upon it . Mass wasting may occur at a very slow rate , particularly in areas that are very dry or those areas that receive sufficient rainfall such that vegetation has stabilized the surface . It may also occur at very high speed , such as in rockslides or landslides , with disastrous consequences , both immediate and delayed , e.g. , resulting from the formation of landslide dams . Factors that change the potential of mass wasting include : change in slope angle , weakening of material by weathering , increased water content ; changes in vegetation cover , and overloading . Volcano flanks can become over-steep resulting in instability and mass wasting . This is now a recognised part of the growth of all active volcanoes .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

The Pennsylvanian is named after the U.S. state of Pennsylvania , where the coal-productive beds of this age are widespread . The division between Pennsylvanian and Mississippian comes from North American stratigraphy . In North America , where the early Carboniferous beds are primarily marine limestones , the Pennsylvanian was in the past treated as a full-fledged geologic period between the Mississippian and the Permian . In Europe , the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are one more-or-less continuous sequence of lowland continental deposits and are grouped together as the Carboniferous Period .

  "/wiki/Sedimentation": "Sedimentation is the tendency for particles in suspension to settle out of the fluid in which they are entrained and come to rest against a barrier . This is due to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them : these forces can be due to gravity , centrifugal acceleration , or electromagnetism . In geology , sedimentation is often used as the opposite of erosion , i.e. , the terminal end of sediment transport . In that sense , it includes the termination of transport by saltation or true bedload transport . Settling is the falling of suspended particles through the liquid , whereas sedimentation is the termination of the settling process . In estuarine environments , settling can be influenced by the presence or absence of vegetation . Trees such as mangroves are crucial to the attenuation of waves or currents , promoting the settlement of suspended particles . Sedimentation may pertain to objects of various sizes , ranging from large rocks in flowing water to suspensions of dust and pollen particles to cellular suspensions to solutions of single molecules such as proteins and peptides . Even small molecules supply a sufficiently strong force to produce significant sedimentation . The term is typically used in geology to describe the deposition of sediment which results in the formation of sedimentary rock , but it is also used in various chemical and environmental fields to describe the motion of often-smaller particles and molecules . This process is also used in the biotech industry to separate cells from the culture media .",

  "/wiki/Little_Grand_Canyon": "The Little Grand Canyon is a box canyon located in Shawnee National Forest in Jackson County , Illinois south of Murphysboro . It is located on east bank of the Big Muddy River across from Turkey Bayou to the west , between Swallow Rock to the north and Chalk Bluff to the south . Access to the park is gained from Hickory Ridge Road to the east . The area was designated a National Natural Landmark in February 1980 . Erosion carved this deep box canyon from the sandstone of the Shawnee Hills , and it opens into the floodplain of the Mississippi River near Turkey Bayou . The canyon contains several seasonal and a few permanent waterfalls , some descending through dramatic cascades of sculpted sandstone . The 3.6-mile ( 5.8 km ) trail is marked by white diamond blazes and begins in the upland hardwood forest . The trail then descends through a steep and sometimes slippery sandstone side canyon to the lusher , damper habitat of the canyon floor . The ascent from the canyon requires a small amount of climbing at the Three Sisters Waterfall . Stone steps on parts of the trail were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps , not by Native Americans as some believe . There is about a 350-foot ( 110 m ) difference in elevation between the bottom of the canyon and the trailhead . The trailhead facilities include a picnic area and pit toilet , and no water is available .",

  "/wiki/Box_canyon": "A canyon ( Spanish : ca\u00f1\u00f3n ; archaic British English spelling : ca\u00f1on ) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from weathering and the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales . Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces , eventually wearing away rock layers as sediments are removed downstream . A river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation , which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains . The processes of weathering and erosion will form canyons when the river 's headwaters and estuary are at significantly different elevations , particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering . A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks , such as those in ranges including the Rocky Mountains , the Alps , the Himalayas or the Andes . Usually a river or stream carve out such splits between mountains . Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California 's Sierra Nevada . Canyons within mountains , or gorges that have an opening on only one side , are called box canyons . Slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls . Steep-sided valleys in the seabed of the continental slope are referred to as submarine canyons . Unlike canyons on land , submarine canyons are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslides .",
  "/wiki/Cache_River_(Illinois)": "The Cache River is a 92-mile-long ( 148 km ) waterway in southernmost Illinois , in a region sometimes called Little Egypt . The basin spans 737 square miles ( 1,910 km2 ) and six counties : Alexander , Johnson , Massac , Pope , Pulaski and Union . Located at the convergence of four major physiographic regions , the river is part of the largest complex of wetlands in Illinois . The Cache River Wetlands - America 's northernmost cypress/tupelo swamp - harbors 91 percent of the state 's high quality swamp and wetland communities . It provides habitat for more than 100 threatened and endangered species in Illinois . In 1996 , the Cache was designated a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention . A significant portion of the Cache River Wetlands are protected by the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources . Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge , established in 1990 , covers 15,000 acres ( 61 km2 ) of aquatic and riparian habitat , and is eventually planned to expand to 35,500 acres ( 144 km2 ) . The Illinois Department of Natural Resources ' Cache River State Natural Area protects another 14,489 acres ( 58.63 km2 ) . And local landowners , through Wetlands Reserve Program easements with Natural Resources Conservation Service , protect an additional 13,500 acres ( 55 km2 ) of restored wetlands .

  "/wiki/Prairie": "Prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands , savannas , and shrublands biome by ecologists , based on similar temperate climates , moderate rainfall , and a composition of grasses , herbs , and shrubs , rather than trees , as the dominant vegetation type . Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay , and the steppe of Ukraine , Russia and Kazakhstan . Lands typically referred to as prairie tend to be in North America . The term encompasses the area referred to as the Interior Lowlands of Canada , the United States , and Mexico , which includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter , hillier land to the east .

  "/wiki/Tallgrass_prairie": "The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America . Natural and anthropogenic fire , as well as grazing by large mammals ( primarily bison ) , were historically agents of periodic disturbance , which regulates tree encroachment , recycles nutrients to the soil , and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes . Prior to widespread use of the steel plow , which enabled large scale conversion to agricultural land use , tallgrass prairies extended throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada , from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests , west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils , to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma , to a transition into forest in Manitoba . They were characteristically found in the central forest-grasslands transition , the central tall grasslands , the upper Midwest forest-savanna transition , and the northern tall grasslands ecoregions . They flourished in areas with rich loess soils and moderate rainfall around 30-35 inches ( 700-900 mm ) per year . To the east were the fire-maintained eastern savannas . In the northeast , where fire was infrequent and periodic windthrow represented the main source of disturbance , beech-maple forests dominated . In contrast , shortgrass prairie was typical in the western Great Plains , where rainfall is less frequent and soils are less fertile . Due to expansive agricultural land use , very little tallgrass prairie remains .",

  "/wiki/Quaking_bog": "A bog or bogland is a wetland that accumulates peat , a deposit of dead plant material - often mosses , and in a majority of cases , sphagnum moss . It is one of the four main types of wetlands . Other names for bogs include mire , quagmire , and muskeg ; alkaline mires are called fens . They are frequently covered in ericaceous shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat . The gradual accumulation of decayed plant material in a bog functions as a carbon sink . Bogs occur where the water at the ground surface is acidic and low in nutrients . In some cases , the water is derived entirely from precipitation , in which case they are termed ombrotrophic ( cloud-fed ) . Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown colour , which comes from dissolved peat tannins . In general , the low fertility and cool climate result in relatively slow plant growth , but decay is even slower owing to the saturated soil . Hence , peat accumulates . Large areas of the landscape can be covered many meters deep in peat . Bogs have distinctive assemblages of animal , fungal and plant species , and are of high importance for biodiversity , particularly in landscapes that are otherwise settled and farmed .",

  "/wiki/Biotic_community": "A biocenosis ( UK English , biocoenosis , also biocenose , biocoenose , biotic community , biological community , ecological community , life assemblage , ) coined by Karl M\u00f6bius in 1877 , describes the interacting organisms living together in a habitat ( biotope ) . In the palaeontological literature , the term distinguishes life assemblages , which reflect the original living community , living together at one place and time . In other words , it is an assemblage of fossils or a community of specific time , which is different from death assemblages ( thanatocoenoses ) . No palaeontological assemblage will ever completely represent the original biological community ( i.e . the biocoenosis , in the sense used by an ecologist ) ; the term thus has somewhat different meanings in a palaeontological and an ecological context . Based on the concept of biocenosis , ecological communities can take in various forms"
