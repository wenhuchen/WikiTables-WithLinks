  "/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale": "The Richter scale - also called the Richter magnitude scale or Richter 's magnitude scale- for measuring the strength of earthquakes refers to the original magnitude scale ( as the author called it ) developed by Charles F. Richter and presented in his landmark 1935 paper . This was later revised [ how ? ] and renamed the local magnitude scale , denoted as ML or ML . Because of various shortcomings of the ML scale most seismological authorities now use other scales , such as the moment magnitude scale ( Mw ) , to report earthquake magnitudes , but much of the news media still refers to these as Richter magnitudes . All magnitude scales retain the logarithmic character of the original and are scaled to have roughly comparable numeric values ( typically in the middle of the scale ) .",

The Romans occupied the region until the end of Roman rule in Britain in 382 , after which Caernarfon became part of the Kingdom of Gwynedd . In the late 11th century , William the Conqueror ordered the construction of a motte-and-bailey castle at Caernarfon as part of the Norman invasion of Wales .
