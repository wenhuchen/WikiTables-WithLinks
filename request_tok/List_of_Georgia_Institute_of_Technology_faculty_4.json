  "/wiki/Multi-core_processor": "A multi-core processor is a computer processor integrated circuit with two or more separate processing units , called cores , each of which reads and executes program instructions , as if the computer had several processors . The instructions are ordinary CPU instructions ( such as add , move data , and branch ) but the single processor can run instructions on separate cores at the same time , increasing overall speed for programs that support multithreading or other parallel computing techniques . Manufacturers typically integrate the cores onto a single integrated circuit die ( known as a chip multiprocessor or CMP ) or onto multiple dies in a single chip package . The microprocessors currently used in almost all personal computers are multi-core . A multi-core processor implements multiprocessing in a single physical package . Designers may couple cores in a multi-core device tightly or loosely . For example , cores may or may not share caches , and they may implement message passing or shared-memory inter-core communication methods . Common network topologies to interconnect cores include bus , ring , two-dimensional mesh , and crossbar . Homogeneous multi-core systems include only identical cores ; heterogeneous multi-core systems have cores that are not identical ( e.g . big.LITTLE have heterogeneous cores that share the same instruction set , while AMD Accelerated Processing Units have cores that do n't even share the same instruction set ) . Just as with single-processor systems , cores in multi-core systems may implement architectures such as VLIW , superscalar , vector , or multithreading . Multi-core processors are widely used across many application domains , including general-purpose , embedded , network , digital signal processing ( DSP ) , and graphics ( GPU ) .",

Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are online communities operating under social networking services . Howard Rheingold discussed virtual communities in his book , The Virtual Community , published in 1993 . The book 's discussion ranges from Rheingold 's adventures on The WELL , computer-mediated communication and social groups and information science . Technologies cited include Usenet , MUDs ( Multi-User Dungeon ) and their derivatives MUSHes and MOOs , Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) , chat rooms and electronic mailing lists . Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being , as well as for society at large , of belonging to a virtual community . Virtual communities all encourage interaction , sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate . Some virtual communities do both . Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means : message boards , chat rooms , social networking World Wide Web sites , or virtual worlds .",
  "/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)": "Constructionist learning is when learners construct mental models to understand the world around them . Constructionism advocates student-centered , discovery learning where students use information they already know to acquire more knowledge . Students learn through participation in project-based learning where they make connections between different ideas and areas of knowledge facilitated by the teacher through coaching rather than using lectures or step-by-step guidance . Further , constructionism holds that learning can happen most effectively when people are active in making tangible objects in the real world . In this sense , constructionism is connected with experiential learning and builds on Jean Piaget 's epistemological theory of constructivism . Seymour Papert defined constructionism in a proposal to the National Science Foundation titled Constructionism : A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education as follows :",

  "/wiki/Robotics": "Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering , electronic engineering , information engineering , computer science , and others . Robotics deals with the design , construction , operation , and use of robots , as well as computer systems for their control , sensory feedback , and information processing . These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions . Robots can be used in many situations and for lots of purposes , but today many are used in dangerous environments ( including bomb detection and deactivation ) , manufacturing processes , or where humans can not survive ( e.g . in space , under water , in high heat , and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation ) . Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance . This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people . Such robots attempt to replicate walking , lifting , speech , cognition , or any other human activity . Many of today 's robots are inspired by nature , contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics . The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times , but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century . Throughout history , it has been frequently assumed by various scholars , inventors , engineers , and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion . Today , robotics is a rapidly growing field , as technological advances continue ; researching , designing , and building new robots serve various practical purposes , whether domestically , commercially , or militarily .",
  "/wiki/Computer_vision": "Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos . From the perspective of engineering , it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do . Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring , processing , analyzing and understanding digital images , and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information , e.g . in the forms of decisions . Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images ( the input of the retina ) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action . This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry , physics , statistics , and learning theory . The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images . The image data can take many forms , such as video sequences , views from multiple cameras , or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner . The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems . Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction , event detection , video tracking , object recognition , 3D pose estimation , learning , indexing , motion estimation , and image restoration .",

  "/wiki/Case-based_reasoning": "Case-based reasoning ( CBR ) , broadly construed , is the process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems . An auto mechanic who fixes an engine by recalling another car that exhibited similar symptoms is using case-based reasoning . A lawyer who advocates a particular outcome in a trial based on legal precedents or a judge who creates case law is using case-based reasoning . So , too , an engineer copying working elements of nature ( practicing biomimicry ) , is treating nature as a database of solutions to problems . Case-based reasoning is a prominent type of analogy solution making . It has been argued that case-based reasoning is not only a powerful method for computer reasoning , but also a pervasive behavior in everyday human problem solving ; or , more radically , that all reasoning is based on past cases personally experienced . This view is related to prototype theory , which is most deeply explored in cognitive science .",
