Promoted as the worlds longest art gallery , the canyon is known for its extensive rock art , most of it created by the Fremont culture and the Ute people . The rock art , shelters , and granaries left behind by the Fremont make Nine Mile Canyon a destination for archaeologists and tourists alike . The canyon became a main transport corridor in the region during the 1880s . Settlers established a number of ranches in Nine Mile , and even a short-lived town named Harper . No longer heavily traveled , the rugged canyon road was used mostly for recreation and tourism through the end of the 20th century . The discovery of rich deposits of natural gas deep beneath the Tavaputs Plateau has brought an influx of industrial truck traffic since 2002 . The large amounts of fugitive dust produced by the trucks ' passage may be damaging the rock art . Public debate is ongoing about how best to balance energy development in the canyon against the preservation of its cultural resources .",

  "/wiki/Maize": "Maize ( /me\u026az/ MAYZ ; Zea mays subsp . mays , from Spanish : ma\u00edz after Taino : mahiz ) , also known as corn , is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago . The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that yield kernels or seeds , which are fruits . Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world , with the total production of maize surpassing that of wheat or rice . However , little of this maize is consumed directly by humans : most is used for corn ethanol , animal feed and other maize products , such as corn starch and corn syrup . The six major types of maize are dent corn , flint corn , pod corn , popcorn , flour corn , and sweet corn . Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels , while field corn varieties are used for animal feed , various corn-based human food uses ( including grinding into cornmeal or masa , pressing into corn oil , and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey ) , and as chemical feedstocks . Maize is also used in making ethanol and other biofuels . Maize is widely cultivated throughout the world , and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain . In 2014 , total world production was 1.04 billion tonnes . Maize is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the Americas , with 361 million metric tons grown in the United States in 2014 . Approximately 40% of the crop - 130 million tons - is used for corn ethanol .",
