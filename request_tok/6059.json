  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
  "/wiki/Television_channel": "A television channel is a terrestrial frequency or virtual number over which a television station or television network is distributed . For example , in North America , channel 2 refers to the terrestrial or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz , with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video ( VSB ) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio ( FM ) , or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC ( 8VSB ) . Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider Depending on the multinational bandplan for a given regional n , analog television channels are typically 6 , 7 , or 8 MHz in bandwidth , and therefore television channel frequencies vary as well . Channel numbering is also different . Digital terrestrial television channels are the same as their analog predecessors for legacy reasons , however through multiplexing , each physical radio frequency ( RF ) channel can carry several digital subchannels . On satellites , each transponder normally carries one channel , however multiple small , independent channels can be on one transponder , with some loss of bandwidth due to the need for guard bands between unrelated transmissions . ISDB , used in Japan and Brazil , has a similar segmented mode . Preventing interference between terrestrial channels in the same area is accomplished by skipping at least one channel between two analog stations ' frequency allocations . Where channel numbers are sequential , frequencies are not contiguous , such as channel 6 to 7 skip from VHF low to high band , and channel 13 to 14 jump to UHF . On cable TV , it is possible to use adjacent channels only because they are all at the same power , something which could only be done terrestrially if the two stations were transmitted at the same power and height from the same location . For DTT , selectivity is inherently better , therefore channels adjacent ( either to analog or digital stations ) can be used even in the same area .",
  "/wiki/Digital_terrestrial_television": "Digital terrestrial television ( DTTV or DTT , or DTTB with broadcasting ) is a technology for terrestrial television in which land-based ( terrestrial ) television stations broadcast television content by radio waves to televisions in consumers ' residences in a digital format . DTTV is a major technological advance over the previous analog television , and has largely replaced analog which had been in common use since the middle of the 20th century . Test broadcasts began in 1998 with the changeover to DTTV ( aka Analog Switchoff ( ASO ) or Digital Switchover ( DSO ) ) beginning in 2006 and is now complete in many countries . The advantages of digital terrestrial television are similar to those obtained by digitising platforms such as cable TV , satellite , and telecommunications : more efficient use of limited radio spectrum bandwidth , provision of more television channels than analog , better quality images , and potentially lower operating costs for broadcasters ( after the initial upgrade costs ) . Different countries have adopted different digital broadcasting standards ; the major ones are :",
