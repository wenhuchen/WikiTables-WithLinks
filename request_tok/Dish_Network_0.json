  "/wiki/Ariane_4": "The Ariane 4 was an expendable launch system , designed by the Centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales ( CNES ) while being manufactured by ArianeGroup and marketed by Arianespace . Since its first flight on 15 June 1988 until the final flight , which was performed on 15 February 2003 , it attained 113 successful launches out of 116 launches to have been conducted . In 1982 , the Ariane 4 programme was approved by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) . Drawing heavily upon the preceding Ariane 3 , it was designed to provide a launcher capable of delivering heavier payloads and at a lower cost per kilogram than the earlier members of the Ariane family . The Ariane 4 was principally an evolution of the existing technologies used , as opposed to being revolutionary in its design ethos ; this approach quickly gained the backing of most ESA members , who funded and participated in its development and operation . Capable of being equipped with a wide variety of strap-on boosters , the Ariane 4 gained a reputation for being an extremely versatile launcher . [ not verified in body ] Once in service , the launcher soon became recognised for being ideal for launching communications and Earth observation satellites , as well as those used for scientific research . During its working life , the Ariane 4 managed to capture 50 per cent of the market in launching commercial satellites , soundly demonstrating Europe 's ability to compete in the commercial launch sector . In February 2003 , the final Ariane 4 was launched ; Arianespace had decided to retire the type in favour of the newer and larger Ariane 5 , which effectively replaced it in service .",

It is a member of Airbus Defence and Space 's Eurostar family . It utilises a chemical , bi-propellant propulsion system for orbit raising and on-station manoeuvres with an optional plasma propulsion system ( PPS ) . The PPS harnesses the Newtonian effect as a result of the ionisation of xenon gas employed by the use of Hall effect plasma thrusters . This system is most commonly used for North-South station-keeping . The E3000 was the first commercial satellite family to use lithium-ion batteries rather than the older nickel-based technologies for power supply during eclipses . The E3000 bus can be modified extensively to meet customer requirements , but most of the E3000 satellites have a launch mass of between 4,500 and 6,000 kilograms ( 9,900 and 13,200 lb ) , and solar arrays between 35 and 45 metres ( 115 and 148 ft ) providing between nine and sixteen kilowatts at end of life .
