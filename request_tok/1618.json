He was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned roles to the others : Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father , and all the gods rise in his presence . He was equated with many foreign weather gods , permitting Pausanias to observe That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men .
