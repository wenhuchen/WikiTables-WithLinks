In the townhall of Edam is a lifesize painting by an unknown artist portraying Keever in civilian clothes with a belt holding at her right a keyring and at her left a pincushion and a sheath with a knife , fork , and spoon . The caption with the painting suggests she was portrayed more beautiful than she really was and that she probably suffered from acromegaly .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

  "/wiki/Scoliosis": "Scoliosis is a medical condition in which a person 's spine has a sideways curve . The curve is usually S- or C-shaped over three dimensions . In some , the degree of curve is stable , while in others , it increases over time . Mild scoliosis does not typically cause problems , but severe cases can interfere with breathing . Typically , no pain is present . The cause of most cases is unknown , but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Risk factors include other affected family members . It can also occur due to another condition such as muscle spasms , cerebral palsy , Marfan syndrome , and tumors such as neurofibromatosis . Diagnosis is confirmed with X-rays . Scoliosis is typically classified as either structural in which the curve is fixed , or functional in which the underlying spine is normal . Treatment depends on the degree of curve , location , and cause . Minor curves may simply be watched periodically .",
