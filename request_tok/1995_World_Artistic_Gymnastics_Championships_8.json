She was the 1994 Asian Games All-Around Champion , a finalist on balance beam at the 1994 and 1995 World Gymnastics Championships , and competed at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta - where she placed 11th in the individual All-Around and 4th with the team during Team Finals . Despite a disappointing showing at the 1994 American Cup , Qiao began her international career on a high : beating her more widely known teammate , Mo Huilan , to the individual All-Around title at the 1994 Asian Games . At these championships Qiao also placed first with her team and finished with a bronze medal on balance beam . At the 1994 World Championships Qiao had moderate success - finishing 10th in the individual all-around and making the balance beam final . She qualified for the beam final in 4th place and was one of the favourites to challenge America 's Shannon Miller for the title but took a fall during the final on her tumbling run ( a back-handspring to two layout somersaults ) , and ultimately finished in 7th place . In 1995 Qiao competed at the 1995 World Championships - where the team took second place behind 1994 World Champions Romania . The Chinese team actually scored the highest in the Team Optionals portion of the competition but their disappointing scores during the Compulsories round ( where they were weak on vault and bars ) prevented them from taking first place . During the team competition she did not compete on all four events and so did not qualify for the individual All-Around final . She did however qualify for the beam final ( for the 2nd consecutive year ) but a balance break at the beginning of the routine ( a difficult round off to layout step-out mount onto the beam ) resulted in an 8th-place finish . Qiao also competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics . After their impressive showing at the 1995 Worlds many gymnastics fans and experts expected the Chinese to challenge the United States , Romania and Russia for the team title .",
