  "/wiki/Tackle_(American_football)": "Tackle is a playing position in gridiron football . Historically , in the one-platoon system prevalent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , a tackle played on both offense and defense . In the modern system of specialized units , offensive tackle and defensive tackle are separate positions , and the stand-alone term tackle refers to the offensive tackle position only . The offensive tackle ( OT , T ) is a position on the offensive line , left and right . Like other offensive linemen , their job is to block : to physically keep defenders away from the offensive player who has the football and enable him to advance the football and eventually score a touchdown . The term tackle is a vestige of an earlier era of football in which the same players played both offense and defense .",
  "/wiki/Cornell": "Cornell University ( /k\u0254\u02d0r\u02c8n\u025bl/ kor-NEL ) is a private and statutory Ivy League research university in Ithaca , New York . Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White , the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge - from the classics to the sciences , and from the theoretical to the applied . These ideals , unconventional for the time , are captured in Cornell 's founding principle , a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation : I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study . The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus , with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy . The university also administers two satellite medical campuses , one in New York City and one in Education City , Qatar , and Cornell Tech , a graduate program that incorporates technology , business , and creative thinking . The program moved from Google 's Chelsea Building in New York City to its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in September 2017 . Cornell is one of ten private land grant universities in the United States and the only one in New York . [ note 1 ] Of its seven undergraduate colleges , three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York ( SUNY ) system , including its agricultural and human ecology colleges as well as its industrial labor relations school . Of Cornell 's graduate schools , only the veterinary college is state-supported . As a land grant college , Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions . The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres , but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic Gardens ( more than 4,300 acres ) and the numerous university-owned lands in New York City are considered . As of October 2019 , 59 Nobel laureates , four Turing Award winners and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with Cornell University .",

  "/wiki/Halfback_(American_football)": "A halfback ( HB ) is an offensive position in American football , whose duties involve lining up in the backfield and carrying the ball on most rushing plays , i.e . a running back . When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the backfield , and especially when that player is placed behind another player ( usually a blocking back ) , as in the I formation , that player is instead referred to as a tailback ( see History below ) . The halfback position is one of the more glamorous positions on the field , and is commonly viewed as a requirement for a team 's success . Sometimes the halfback can catch the ball from the backfield on short passing plays as he is an eligible receiver . Occasionally , they line up as additional wide receivers . When not running or catching the ball , the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking , either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football .",

  "/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)": "A fullback ( FB ) is a position known as the best position in the game of football , in the offensive backfield in gridiron football , and is one of the two running back positions along with the halfback . Typically , fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running , pass catching , and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back . Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks . Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott , Daryl Johnston , and Lorenzo Neal .",
