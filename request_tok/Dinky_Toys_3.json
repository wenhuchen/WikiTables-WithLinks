  "/wiki/Thunderbirds_(TV_series)": "Thunderbirds is a British science-fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson , filmed by their production company AP Films ( APF ) and distributed by ITC Entertainment . It was produced between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry ( dubbed Supermarionation ) combined with scale-model special effects sequences . Two series were filmed , comprising a total of thirty-two 50-minute episodes ; production ceased following the completion of the second series ' sixth episode when Lew Grade , the Andersons ' financial backer , failed in his efforts to sell the programme to American network television . Set in the mid-2060s , Thunderbirds is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls , Supercar , Fireball XL5 and Stingray . It follows the exploits of International Rescue ( IR ) , a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically-advanced land , sea , air and space rescue craft ; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from IR 's secret base in the Pacific Ocean . The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy , the founder of IR , and his five adult sons , who pilot the Thunderbird machines . Thunderbirds began its first run in the United Kingdom on the ITV network in 1965 and has since been broadcast in at least 66 other countries . Periodically repeated , it was adapted for radio in the early 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media . As well as inspiring various merchandising campaigns , the series has been followed by two feature-length film sequels ( Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6 , released in 1966 and 1968 , respectively ) , a 2004 live-action film adaptation and a mimed stage show tribute . The second of two TV remakes , Thunderbirds Are Go , debuted in 2015 . Widely considered to be the Andersons ' most popular and commercially successful series , Thunderbirds has received particular praise for its effects ( directed by Derek Meddings ) and musical score ( composed by Barry Gray ) . It is also well remembered for its title sequence , which opens with an often-quoted countdown by actor Peter Dyneley ( who voiced the character of Jeff ) : 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 : Thunderbirds Are Go !",
  "/wiki/Thunderbirds_machines": "The Thunderbird machines were a series of speculative fiction machines imagined for the mid-1960s film and television Thunderbirds series , developed by Gerry Anderson . The released work began with the Supermarionation television series Thunderbirds and was followed by subsequent feature films Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6 in 1965-68 . The series featured a large variety of futuristic air , land and sea vehicles and machines , the majority of which were designed by special effects director Derek Meddings . In the context of the series , most of the advanced machines appearing in the series belonged to the International Rescue organisation and were used during their rescues . These were known as the Thunderbirds , of which there were five core machines and a variety of other rescue craft . It was after these that the series was named . In the series , all of the International Rescue vehicles were designed by the organisation 's resident technical genius known as Brains . The use of these models in Anderson 's Supermarionation productions beginning with Supercar was a significant advance in television production . This dirt and wear was applied as a way of adding realism and countering the miniature models ' toy-like appearance . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Joe_90": "Joe 90 is a British science-fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company , Century 21 , for ITC Entertainment . It follows the exploits of nine-year-old schoolboy Joe McClaine , who becomes a spy after his adoptive father invents a device capable of recording expert knowledge and experience and transferring it to another human brain . Armed with the skills of the world 's top academic and military minds , Joe is recruited by the World Intelligence Network ( WIN ) as its Most Special Agent . First broadcast on the ITV regional franchises between 1968 and 1969 , the 30-episode series was the sixth and last of the Andersons ' productions to be made primarily using a form of marionette puppetry dubbed Supermarionation . Their final puppet series , The Secret Service , would include extensive footage of live actors . As in the preceding series , Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons , the puppets of Joe 90 are of natural body proportions as opposed to the caricatured design used for Thunderbirds and earlier Supermarionation productions . Though not as successful as Century 21 's earlier efforts , Joe 90 has been praised for the characterisation of its main puppet cast and the quality of its scale model sets and special effects . Critics have interpreted the series ' spy-fi theme and use of a child protagonist as both a kids-play-Bond concept and an enshrinement of children 's imagination . Points of criticism include the violence of some episodes and the lack of female characters , which has been viewed by some commentators as being tantamount to sexism . As with its earlier productions , Century 21 produced tie-ins from comic strips to toy cars . The series was syndicated in the United States in 1969 , repeated in the UK in the 1990s and released on DVD in the 2000s . A live-action film adaptation has been proposed more than once but remains undeveloped .",

  "/wiki/Captain_Scarlet_and_the_Mysterons": "Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons , often shortened to Captain Scarlet , is a British science-fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company Century 21 Productions for distributor ITC Entertainment . Running to thirty-two 25-minute episodes , it was first broadcast on ITV regional franchises between 1967 and 1968 and has since been transmitted in more than 40 other countries , including the United States , Australia , New Zealand and Japan . It is one of several Anderson series that were filmed using a form of electronic marionette puppetry dubbed Supermarionation combined with scale model special effects sequences . Set in 2068 , Captain Scarlet follows the war of nerves between Earth and the Mysterons , a race of Martians who possess partial control over matter . When a misunderstanding causes human astronauts to attack their city on Mars , the Mysterons vow revenge and launch a series of reprisals against Earth . These are countered by Spectrum , a worldwide security organisation . In the first episode , Spectrum agent Captain Scarlet acquires the Mysterons ' self-healing power of retro-metabolism and is thus rendered indestructible , being able to recover from otherwise fatal injuries . In this way , Scarlet becomes Spectrum 's top asset in its fight against the Mysterons . Captain Scarlet , the Andersons ' eighth of ten puppet series , was preceded by Thunderbirds and followed by Joe 90 and The Secret Service . In terms of visual aesthetic , it represents a departure from Thunderbirds in its use of non-caricatured puppets sculpted to realistic body proportions . Repeated several times in the UK , it has generated tie-ins from toy cars and dolls to audio plays and original novels as well as comic strips in Century 21 's weekly comic TV Century 21 . Compared to Thunderbirds and earlier Anderson series , Captain Scarlet is generally considered darker in tone and less suited to child audiences due to its violent content and themes of alien aggression and interplanetary war .",

  "/wiki/Mini_Moke": "The Mini Moke is a small , front-drive utility and recreational convertible , manufactured and marketed originally by British Motor Corporation ( BMC ) , and subsequently marketed under the Austin , Morris and Leyland brands . Designed by Sir Alec Issigonis and John Sheppard , the Mini Moke is noted for its simple , straightforward , doorless design , and its adaptability . Originally prototyped as a lightweight military vehicle using the engine , transmission and suspension parts from the Mini van , the design 's small wheels and low ground clearance made it unsuitable as an off road military vehicle . The design was subsequently offered in civilian form as a low-cost , easily maintained vehicle , achieving global popularity as a lightweight , recreational and utility vehicle . The first Mokes were manufactured at BMC 's Longbridge , Birmingham plant , with 14,518 produced in the UK between 1964 and 1968 . 26,000 were manufactured in Australia between 1966 and 1981 , and 10,000 in Portugal between 1980 and 1993 when production ended . The name combines Mini with Moke , an archaic term for mule .",

The series was first broadcast in Canada beginning on 6 September 1967 , in the UK on 29 September 1967 , and in the US on 1 June 1968 . Although the show was sold as a thriller in the mould of the previous series starring McGoohan , Danger Man ( 1960-68 ; retitled as Secret Agent in the US ) , its combination of 1960s countercultural themes and surrealistic setting had a far-reaching influence on science fiction and fantasy TV programming , and on narrative popular culture in general . Since its initial screening , the series has developed a cult following . A six-part TV miniseries remake aired on the US cable channel AMC in November 2009 . In 2016 Big Finish Productions reinterpreted the series as an audio drama .",
  "/wiki/Mini": "The Mini is a small economy car produced by the English-based British Motor Corporation ( BMC ) and its successors from 1959 until 2000 . The original is considered an icon of 1960s British popular culture . Its space-saving transverse engine and front-wheel drive layout - allowing 80% of the area of the car 's floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage - influenced a generation of car makers . In 1999 , the Mini was voted the second-most influential car of the 20th century , behind the Ford Model T , and ahead of the Citro\u00ebn DS and Volkswagen Beetle . The front-wheel-drive , transverse-engine layout of the Mini was copied for other supermini designs including the Honda N360 ( 1967 ) , Nissan Cherry ( 1970 ) , and Fiat 127 ( 1971 ) . The layout was also adapted for larger subcompact designs . This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by Sir Alec Issigonis . It was manufactured at the Longbridge and Cowley plants in England , the Victoria Park/Zetland British Motor Corporation ( Australia ) factory in Sydney , Australia , and later also in Spain ( Authi ) , Belgium , Chile , Italy ( Innocenti ) , Malta , Portugal , South Africa , Uruguay , Venezuela , and Yugoslavia . The Mini Mark I had three major UK updates - the Mark II , the Clubman , and the Mark III . Within these was a series of variations , including an estate car , a pick-up truck , a van , and the Mini Moke , a jeep-like buggy . The performance versions , the Mini Cooper and Cooper S , were successful as both race and rally cars , winning the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964 , 1965 , and 1967 . In 1966 , the first-placed Mini ( along with nine other cars ) was disqualified after the finish , under a controversial decision that the car 's headlights were against the rules .",
  "/wiki/Ford_Model_T": "The Ford Model T ( colloquially known as the Tin Lizzie , Leaping Lena , jitney or flivver ) is an automobile produced by Ford Motor Company from October 1 , 1908 , to May 26 , 1927 . It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile , that made car travel available to middle-class Americans . The relatively low price was partly the result of Ford 's efficient fabrication , including assembly line production instead of individual hand crafting . The Ford Model T was named the most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 Car of the Century competition , ahead of the BMC Mini , Citro\u00ebn DS , and Volkswagen Type 1 . Ford 's Model T was successful not only because it provided inexpensive transportation on a massive scale , but also because the car signified innovation for the rising middle class and became a powerful symbol of the United States age of modernization . With 16.5 million sold , it stood eighth on the top ten list of most sold cars of all time , as of 2012 [ update ] . Although automobiles had been produced from the 1880s , until the Model T was introduced in 1908 , they were mostly scarce , expensive , and often unreliable . Positioned as reliable , easily maintained , mass-market transportation , it was a runaway success . In a matter of days after the release , 15,000 orders had been placed . The first production Model T was built on August 12 , 1908 and left the factory on September 27 , 1908 , at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit , Michigan . On May 26 , 1927 , Henry Ford watched the 15 millionth Model T Ford roll off the assembly line at his factory in Highland Park , Michigan . Henry Ford conceived a series of cars between the founding of the company in 1903 and the introduction of the Model T. Ford named his first car the Model A and proceeded through the alphabet up through the Model T , twenty models in all .",
  "/wiki/The_Secret_Service": "The Secret Service is a 1969 British science-fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company , Century 21 , for ITC Entertainment . It follows the exploits of Father Stanley Unwin , a puppet character voiced by ( and modelled on ) the comedian of the same name . Outwardly an eccentric Christian vicar , Unwin is secretly an agent of BISHOP , a division of British Intelligence countering criminal and terrorist threats . Assisted by fellow agent Matthew Harding , Unwin 's missions involve frequent use of the Minimiser , a device capable of shrinking people and objects to facilitate covert operations . In hostile situations , the Father spouts a form of gibberish ( based on the real Unwin 's nonsense Unwinese ) to distract the enemy . The Secret Service was the last Anderson series to be made using a form of electronic marionette puppetry called Supermarionation . This technique is combined with scale model effects sequences and - uniquely for an Anderson puppet series - extensive footage of live actors in long shot . The move towards non-puppet live action was influenced by Gerry Anderson , who wanted to increase the realism of Supermarionation . Filming began in August 1968 and ended with the completion of the 13th episode the following January after Century 21 's financial backer Lew Grade responded negatively to a test screening , believing that the inclusion of Unwinese had made it impossible to sell the series to the American market . Critical response has been mixed , with verdicts ranging from the Andersons ' forgotten gem to their one flop . Commentators have questioned the wisdom of hiring Unwin , suggesting that his gibberish had too little comic value to sustain viewer interest . However , the series has been praised for the writing of its supporting characters .",

A single series of 26 episodes ( including the pilot ) was filmed over the course of more than a year ; a five-month production break was caused by the closure of MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood , where the show was initially made . Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire . UFO was first broadcast in the UK and Canada in 1970 , and in US syndication over the next two years . The Andersons had previously made several successful children 's science fiction programmes using marionettes , including Supercar , Fireball XL5 , Stingray , Thunderbirds , Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and Joe 90 . An exception to this was the series The Secret Service , in which a combination of both marionettes and live actors was used . The Andersons ' live-action science fiction movie Doppelg\u00e4nger ( also known as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun ) is considered an immediate precursor to UFO , which was their first live-action TV series . The series featured actors , costumes , props , locations and music that had appeared in the film , and 11 cast members of the film appeared in at least one episode of UFO . Following syndication in the US and initial favourable ratings , a possible second series was planned ; initially entitled UFO 1999 , this eventually became Space : 1999 .",

Developed by screenwriter Gene L. Coon in 1967 for the original Star Trek ( TOS ) series , Klingons were swarthy humanoids characterized by prideful ruthlessness and brutality . Klingons practiced feudalism and authoritarianism , with a warrior caste relying on slave labor . With a greatly expanded budget for makeup and effects , the Klingons were completely redesigned for Star Trek : The Motion Picture ( 1979 ) , acquiring ridged foreheads . In subsequent television series and in later films , the militaristic traits of the Klingons were bolstered by an increased sense of honor and strict warrior code similar to those of bushido . Klingons are recurring antagonists in the 1960s television series Star Trek , and have appeared in all subsequent series , along with ten of the Star Trek feature films . Initially intended to be antagonists for the crew of the USS Enterprise , the Klingons became a close ally of humanity in Star Trek : The Next Generation . In the 1990s series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , humans and Klingons join with the Romulans to fight the Dominion . Among the elements created for the revised Klingons was a complete Klingon language , developed by Marc Okrand from gibberish suggested by actor James Doohan . Spoken Klingon has entered popular culture , even to the extent that the works of William Shakespeare and parts of the Bible have been translated into it . A dictionary , a book of sayings , and a cultural guide to the language have been published . According to the Guinness World Records , Klingon is the world 's most popular fictional language as measured by number of speakers .",

It is the main setting of the original Star Trek television series ( 1966-1969 ) and several Star Trek films , and it has been depicted in various spinoffs , films , books , products , and fan-created media . Under the command of Captain James T. Kirk , the Enterprise carries its crew on a mission to explore strange , new worlds ; to seek out new life and new civilizations ; to boldly go where no man has gone before . Matt Jefferies designed the Enterprise for television , and its core design components - a saucer-shaped primary hull , two outset engine nacelles , and a cylindrical secondary hull - have persisted across several television and film redesigns . After the Enterprise 's destruction in the third franchise film , that vessel 's filming model was redressed and depicted as its successor starship , the USS Enterprise , NCC-1701-A . Initially a vision of the potential for human spaceflight , the original Enterprise became a popular culture icon . The vessel 's original appearance influenced the design of subsequent franchise spacecraft . The model filmed for Star Trek has been on display for decades at the National Air and Space Museum .
