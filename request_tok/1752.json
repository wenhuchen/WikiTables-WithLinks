The portion of US 11 south of Watertown follows a mostly north-south alignment and is paralleled by Interstate 81 ( I-81 ) while the part of the route north of Watertown follows a more east-west routing , parallel to but not directly on the St. Lawrence River . The portion of US 11 in New York passes through the central district of four cities : Binghamton , Cortland , Syracuse , and Watertown . East of Watertown , the route traverses mostly rural terrain and serves only small villages , such as Potsdam , Malone , and Champlain . While the portion of US 11 between the Pennsylvania state line and Watertown is merely an alternate route to I-81 , the section east of Watertown is the primary long-distance route across the North Country of New York . US 11 was designated as part of the 1926 establishment of the U.S. Highway System . It was first signed in New York in 1927 , replacing New York State Route 2 ( NY 2 ) , a route assigned three years earlier as part of the creation of the modern New York state route system . The termini of US 11 have more or less remained the same since ; however , multiple realignments have occurred along the points in between .

Recently , some new markers have been added at junctions with some state highways . However , others were never added , so it may not be easy to find these routes . Also , several of these routes begin on the outskirts of small towns and villages , and there are no signs pointing the way for motorists to find these routes from main streets .
