  "/wiki/Opera_semiseria": "Opera semiseria ( 'semi-serious opera ' ) is an Italian genre of opera , popular in the early and middle 19th century . Related to the opera buffa , opera semiseria contains elements of comedy but also of pathos , sometimes with a pastoral setting . It can usually be distinguished from tragic operas or melodramas by the presence of a basso buffo . One of the better-known examples is Gaetano Donizetti 's Linda di Chamounix . Another example is Gioacchino Rossini 's La gazza ladra . Vincenzo Bellini 's La sonnambula has all the characteristics of the genre except the presence of the required basso buffo and is regarded as both opera seria and opera semiseria .",

Its continuously built-up metropolitan area ( that stretches beyond the boundaries of the Metropolitan City of Naples ) is the second or third largest metropolitan area in Italy and one of the most densely populated cities in Europe . First settled by Greeks in the second millennium BC , Naples is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world .

The city was an important part of Magna Graecia , played a major role in the merging of Greek and Roman society and a significant cultural centre under the Romans . It served as the capital of the Duchy of Naples ( 661-1139 ) , then of the Kingdom of Naples ( 1282-1816 ) and finally of the Two Sicilies until the unification of Italy in 1861 . Naples is also considered a capital of the Baroque since the arrival of Caravaggio in the 17th century , and due to the artistic revolution his arrival occasioned . Between 1925 and 1936 , Naples was expanded and upgraded by Benito Mussolini 's government but subsequently sustained severe damage from Allied bombing during World War II , which led to extensive post-1945 reconstruction work . Naples has experienced significant economic growth in recent decades , helped by the construction of the Centro Direzionale business district and an advanced transportation network , which includes the Alta Velocit\u00e0 high-speed rail link to Rome and Salerno and an expanded subway network . Naples is the third-largest urban economy in Italy , after Milan and Rome .

Also , Bellini 's recycling of his own music in this opera has been analyzed , as well as his utilizing a more self-consciously innovative compositional style and participating more in work on the libretto , as compared with prior efforts where he was more deferential to the librettists chosen by the Naples opera management and the corresponding texts .

After he and Giuditta Pasta ( for whom the opera was to be written ) had together seen the ballet based on the very different play , Tedaldi-Fores ' Beatrice Tenda , in Milan in October 1832 , she became enthusiastic about the subject and the composer set about persuading Romani that this was a good idea .

Although unsuccessful at its premiere in Venice in 1833 , Bellini felt that he had counteracted the horror of its story by means of the music , colouring it now tremendously and now sadly .

The music was set to a libretto by Count Carlo Pepoli , an Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 poet whom Bellini had met at a salon run by the exile Princess Belgiojoso , which became a meeting place for many Italian revolutionaries . The subject was T\u00eates Rondes et Cavalieres ( Roundheads and Cavaliers ) , a historical play written by Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Ancelot and Joseph Xavier Saintine , which some sources state was based on Walter Scott 's novel Old Mortality , while others state that there is no connection . When Bellini arrived in Paris in mid-August 1833 , he had intended to stay only about three weeks , the main aim being to continue the negotiations with the Paris Op\u00e9ra which had begun on his way to London a few months earlier . However , these negotiations came to nothing , but by October he had decided to spend the winter in that city , especially as both Il pirata and I Capuleti e i Montecchi were to be given by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien that season . The offer from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre came in January 1834 ; he accepted because the pay was richer than what I had received in Italy up to then , though only by a little ; then because of so magnificent a company ; and finally so as to remain in Paris at others ' expense . Taking from April until its premiere the following January , Bellini had time to ensure that the opera was as close to perfection as possible . After the premiere , Bellini reported to his friend Francesco Florimo in Naples that :",

  "/wiki/Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien": "Com\u00e9die-Italienne or Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien are French names which have been used to refer to Italian-language theatre and opera when performed in France . The earliest recorded visits by Italian players were commedia dell'arte companies employed by the French court under the Italian-born queens Catherine de Medici and Marie de Medici . These troupes also gave public performances in Paris at the theatre of the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne , probably the earliest public theatre to be built in France . The first official use of the name Com\u00e9die-Italienne was in 1680 , when it was given to the commedia dell'arte troupe at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne , to distinguish it from the French troupe , the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise , which was founded that year , and just as the name Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais was commonly applied to the latter , Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien was used for the Italians . Over time French phrases , songs , whole scenes , and eventually entire plays were incorporated into the Com\u00e9die-Italienne 's performances . By 1762 the company was merged with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique , but the names Com\u00e9die-Italienne and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien continued to be used , even though the repertory soon became almost exclusively French op\u00e9ra-comique . The names were dropped completely in 1801 , when the company was merged with the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Feydeau . From 1801 to 1878 , Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien was used for a succession of Parisian opera companies performing Italian opera in Italian . In 1980 the name La Com\u00e9die-Italienne was used for a theatre in the Montparnasse district of Paris , which presents Italian commedia dell'arte plays in French translation ."
