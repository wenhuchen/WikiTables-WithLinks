The Olympic record was broken in 17 returning events . In five events , including the inaugural women 's 3000 m steeplechase , the world record was broken . The athletics was , alongside the Olympic cycling events , one of the few large sports programmes in which the host nation fared comparatively poorly in terms of medals won . Despite a haul of 100 medals at the games as a whole , Chinese athletes took home two bronze medals from the athletics events . The country 's foremost athlete Liu Xiang , the 2004 Olympic champion in the 110 metres hurdles , had to withdraw after a false start due to injury .

  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people , usually wearing protective gloves , throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring . Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games - it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing , disqualification of an opponent , or resignation of an opponent . When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing , the judges ' scorecards determine the victor . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , professional bouts are considered a draw . In Olympic boxing , because a winner must be declared , judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria . While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history , the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC . The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece , where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules .",
