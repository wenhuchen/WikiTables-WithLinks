It is enough to say that in substance it restrained the Appellant Company ( the Railway Company ) from erecting , maintaining , or operating a live of telegraph upon their own land , for the purposes of the efficient working of their own railway , with the usual incidents which naturally follow from such an injunction",

        "This Appeal is from a Judgment of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland in an action brought on 2 November 1905 by the Anglo-American Telegraph Company against the Reid-Newfoundland Company , wherein the Defendants had pleaded the Statutes of Limitations ( 21 Jac . I , chapter 16 , and local statutes ) as to so much of the Plaintiffs claim as accrued prior to 2 November 1899 . The Plaintiffs had replied that the pleas disclosed no defence because the action was taken on a specialty contract under which the period of limitation was 20 years . The issue thus raised was heard on 1 February 1911 before the Full Court , which decided , by a majority of two out of three Judges ( Mr Justice Emerson dissenting ) , that the Plaintiffs replication was good",

Cut and carried away and disposed of to its own use . The case was heard in the first instance before Mr. Justice Johnston , who found in favour of the Pulp Co. For the sum of $ 6,040 in respect of timber which had admittedly been wrongfully cut and appropriate by the Development Co. , but he disallowed the claim in respect of certain other timber which he held that the Development Co. were entitled to cut and appropriate under a certain reservation clause of a sub-license which will be more particularly dealt with later on . On appeal to the full Court his Judgment upon the latter point was reversed and the damages were accordingly increased to $ 15,536.68 . it is against this variation of the Judgment of Mr. Justice Johnston that the present Appeal is brought . The figures at which the damages have been assessed are not in dispute . The sole question is as to the right to recover these damages at all",

        "Their Lordships have had an opportunity of considering this case . The only question in dispute is the construction of the letter of 10 June 1912 which , at all events , was intended to be in effect a charter party . It is a dubious document in itself , and it is rendered more so by the interpretation which the parties themselves have put upon it ; because they altered it by consent at the time of payment . The point in dispute really is whether the vessel in question was chartered month by month , or chartered for a definite period of three months . The Court below came to the conclusion that it was a monthly hiring . That decision ought not to be overruled unless their Lordships are clearly of opinion that it was wrong . The Appellants have not been able to convince them that it was wrong , and , under those circumstances , their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that the Appeal should be dismissed with costs",
