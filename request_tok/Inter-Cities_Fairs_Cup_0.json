  "/wiki/London_XI": "London XI was a football team created to take part in the 1955-58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup . The competition began in 1955 , and the first tournament took three years to complete . The entrants were the major football team of each city which held a Trade Fair . Like many cities taking part , London had several strong teams ; however , rules stated that there could only be a single team from each city . It was decided to create a team especially for the tournament , using the best players from each London-based club . Membership of the team varied considerably between matches , to the effect that as many as 54 players took part in the 8 matches of the campaign . The London XI , managed by Chelsea chairman Joe Mears , reached the final of the cup , after coming top of a group that included special XI teams from Basel and Frankfurt , and then beating Lausanne Sports . London lost 8-2 on aggregate over two legs to FC Barcelona . The London XI only competed in the 1955-58 tournament , all future Inter-Cities Fairs Cups involving a London team were contested by individual clubs from London instead . A unified London side competed in friendly matches even earlier : a London team represented the FA in the historic 1866 London v Sheffield match , there were several challenges against the Glasgow FA during the 1880s , and there is passing mention of London having been heavily defeated in a friendly match against Corinthian in a 1904 Times article . Two other matches have been referenced - an annual match versus Birmingham on 3 October 1910 and a match versus Paris on 18 December 1910 ."
