The Jin emerged from Taizu 's rebellion against the Liao dynasty ( 907-1125 ) , which held sway over northern China until the nascent Jin drove the Liao to the Western Regions , where they became known as the Western Liao . After vanquishing the Liao , the Jurchen Jin launched an over hundred-year struggles against the Chinese Song dynasty ( 960-1279 ) , which was based in southern China .

  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems .",

It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant . In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries , the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people . Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people .

It was the last prolonged period of multiple political division in Chinese imperial history . Traditionally , the era started with the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907 AD and reached its climax with the founding of the dominant Song dynasty in 960 . In the remaining 19 years Song gradually subdued all the remaining states . Many states had been de facto independent kingdoms long before 907 , as Tang dynasty 's ability to control its vassals gradually waned , but have now been recognized as such by foreign powers . After the Tang had collapsed , the kings who controlled the Central Plain crowned themselves as emperors . During the 70-year-long period , there was near constant warfare between all the emerged kingdoms and alliances they formed . All of them had the control of the Central Plain as their ultimate goal as that would have granted them the legitimacy over all their territories and rest of China as the legitimate successor to Tang .

The empire was founded by Yel\u00fc Abaoji ( Emperor Taizu of Liao ) , Khagan of the Khitans around the time of the collapse of the Tang dynasty and was the first state to control all of Manchuria . Being ruled by the Khitan Yel\u00fc clan , the Liao dynasty is considered by historians to be a conquest dynasty of China . Almost immediately after its founding , the Liao dynasty began a process of territorial expansion , with Abaoji leading a successful conquest of Balhae . Later emperors would gain the Sixteen Prefectures by fueling a proxy war that led to the collapse of the Later Tang ( 923-936 ) and would establish tributary relationships with Goryeo after losing the Goryeo-Khitan Wars . In 1004 , the Liao dynasty launched an imperial expedition against the Northern Song dynasty . After heavy fighting and large casualties between the two empires , both sides worked out the Chanyuan Treaty . Through the treaty , the Liao dynasty forced the Northern Song to recognize them as peers and heralded an era of peace and stability between the two powers that lasted approximately 120 years . Tension between traditional Khitan social and political practices and Chinese influence and customs was a defining feature of the dynasty . This tension led to a series of succession crises ; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture , while much of the rest of the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate . So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments . The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices , while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations , adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices .",

  "/wiki/Northern_and_Southern_dynasties": "The Northern and Southern dynasties ( Chinese : \u5357\u5317\u671d ; pinyin : N\u00e1n-B\u011bi Ch\u00e1o ) was a period in the history of China that lasted from 386 to 589 , following the tumultuous era of the Sixteen Kingdoms and the Wu Hu states . It is sometimes considered as the latter part of a longer period known as the Six Dynasties ( 220 to 589 ) . Though an age of civil war and political chaos , it was also a time of flourishing arts and culture , advancement in technology , and the spread of Mahayana Buddhism and Daoism . The period saw large-scale migration of Han Chinese to the lands south of the Yangtze . The period came to an end with the unification of all of China proper by Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty . During this period , the process of sinicization accelerated among the non-Chinese arrivals in the north and among the indigenous people in the south . This process was also accompanied by the increasing popularity of Buddhism ( introduced into China in the 1st century ) in both northern and southern China and Daoism gaining influence as well , with two essential Daoist canons written during this period . Notable technological advances occurred during this period . The invention of the stirrup during the earlier Jin dynasty ( 265-420 ) helped spur the development of heavy cavalry as a combat standard . Historians also note advances in medicine , astronomy , mathematics , and cartography . Intellectuals of the period include the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi ( 429-500 ) ."
