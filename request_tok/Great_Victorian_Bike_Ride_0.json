It is the administrative centre for the City of Greater Bendigo , which encompasses both the urban area and outlying towns spanning an area around 3,000 km2 ( 1,158 sq mi ) and over 111,000 people . The discovery of gold in the soils of Bendigo during the 1850s made it one of the most significant Victorian-era boomtowns in Australia . News of the finds intensified the Victorian gold rush , bringing an influx of migrants to the city from around the world within a year and transforming it from a sheep station to a major settlement in the newly proclaimed Colony of Victoria . Once the alluvial gold had been mined out , mining companies were formed to exploit the rich underground quartz reef gold . Since 1851 , about 780,000 kilograms ( 25 million troy ounces ) of gold have been extracted from Bendigo 's goldmines , making it the highest producing goldfield in Australia in the 19th century and the largest gold-mining economy in eastern Australia . It is also notable for its Victorian architectural heritage . The city took its name from the Bendigo Creek and its residents from the earliest days of the gold rush have been called Bendigonians . Although the town flourished in its beginnings as a result of the discovery of gold , it experienced a reversal of fortune in the early 20th century .

Unlike many other gold boom towns , the Ballarat fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades , which can be evidenced to this day in the city 's rich architecture . The city is famous for the 1854 tax-revolt known as the Eureka Rebellion . In response to this event the first male suffrage in Australia was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of democracy in Australia . The rebellion 's symbol , the Eureka Flag , has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat .

It became commonplace to call the area The Rosebud in reference to the ship , which was shortened to Rosebud as the last vestiges of the ship disappeared .
