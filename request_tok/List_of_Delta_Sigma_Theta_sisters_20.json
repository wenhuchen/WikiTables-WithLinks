At 592,800 square kilometres ( 228,900 sq mi ) Madagascar is the world 's 2nd largest island country . The nation comprises the island of Madagascar ( the fourth- largest island in the world ) and numerous smaller peripheral islands . Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana , Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago , allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation . Consequently , Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot ; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth . The island 's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats . The archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago . Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and 550 AD by Indianized Austronesian peoples , arriving on outrigger canoes from Indonesia . The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of Hinduism and Buddhism , along with native Indonesian culture . These were joined around the 9th century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa . Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time , each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life . The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more subgroups , of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands .",

  "/wiki/African-American": "African Americans ( also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans ) are an ethnic group of Americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of Africa . The phrase generally refers to descendants of enslaved black people who are from the United States . African Americans constitute the third largest ethnic group and the second largest racial group in the US , after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans . Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States . On average , African Americans are of West/Central African and European descent , and some also have Native American ancestry . According to U.S. Census Bureau data , African immigrants generally do not self-identify as African American . The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities ( \u224895% ) . Immigrants from some Caribbean , Central American , and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term . African-American history starts in the 16th century , with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America , and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America . After the founding of the United States , black people continued to be enslaved , and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865 . Due to notions of white supremacy , they were treated as second-class citizens . The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only , and only white men who owned property could vote .",
