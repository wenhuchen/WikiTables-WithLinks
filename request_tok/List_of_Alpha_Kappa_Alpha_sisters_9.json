  "/wiki/Bank": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit . Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets . Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries . Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities . In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity , banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords . Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world . In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties - notably , the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds - have played a central role over many centuries . The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank .",

( listen ( help\u00b7info ) ) ( /v\u0259\u02c8ra\u026az\u0259n/ v\u0259-RY-z\u0259n ) is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average . The company is based at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan , New York City , but is incorporated in Delaware . In 1984 , the United States Department of Justice mandated AT & T Corporation to break up the Bell System and split into seven companies , each a Regional Bell Operating Company ( RBOC ) , and commonly referred to as Baby Bells . One of the Baby Bells , Bell Atlantic , came into existence in 1984 , consisting of the separate operating companies New Jersey Bell , Bell of Pennsylvania , Diamond State Telephone , and C & P Telephone , with a trading area from New Jersey to Virginia . This company would later become Verizon . As part of a rebranding of the Baby Bells in the mid-1990s , all of Bell Atlantic 's operating companies assumed the holding company 's name . In 1997 , Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX . Although Bell Atlantic was the surviving company name , the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX 's old headquarters in New York City . In 2000 , Bell Atlantic acquired GTE , which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic 's footprint . Bell Atlantic , the surviving entity , changed its name to Verizon , a portmanteau of veritas ( Latin for truth ) and horizon . In 2015 , Verizon expanded into content ownership by acquiring AOL , and two years later it acquired Yahoo ! . AOL and Yahoo were amalgamated into a new division named Oath Inc. ( currently known as Verizon Media ) .",

As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States . Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city 's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek . Washington 's metropolitan area , the country 's sixth largest ( including parts of Maryland , Virginia and West Virginia ) , had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents .",
