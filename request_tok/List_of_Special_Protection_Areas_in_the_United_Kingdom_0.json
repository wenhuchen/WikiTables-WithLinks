  "/wiki/Abberton_Reservoir": "Abberton Reservoir is an artificial body of water located close to the coast of Essex in the east of England . It is 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) south-west of Colchester near the village of Layer de la Haye . The reservoir is the fourth largest reservoir in England with an area of 4.9 square kilometres ( 1,200 acres ) . It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest , and also a Ramsar site , designated an internationally important wetland . It is a Special Protection Area , and it is listed in the Nature Conservation Review . A small part of the site is managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust . It is a large , shallow , freshwater storage reservoir and is the largest freshwater body in Essex . The reservoir contains around 25,000 megalitres ( 5.5\u00d7109 imp gal ) . It is a pumped storage reservoir . This means water is pumped from the rivers Chelmer , Blackwater and Stour to fill it , rather than simply relying on rainfall in the limited catchment area . The reservoir was formed by damming a shallow river valley . Plans to increase the capacity of Abberton reservoir to 41,000 megalitres ( 9.0\u00d7109 imp gal ) by raising its bank height were completed in 2015 .",

It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary and comprises five metropolitan boroughs : Knowsley , St Helens , Sefton , Wirral , and the city of Liverpool . Merseyside , which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , takes its name from the River Mersey . Merseyside spans 249 square miles ( 645 km2 ) of land which border Lancashire ( to the north-east ) , Greater Manchester ( to the east ) , Cheshire ( to the south and south-east ) and the Irish Sea to the west . North Wales is across the Dee Estuary . There is a mix of high density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Merseyside , but overwhelmingly the land use is urban . It has a focused central business district , formed by Liverpool City Centre , but Merseyside is also a polycentric county with five metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . The Liverpool Urban Area is the fifth most populous conurbation in England , and dominates the geographic centre of the county , while the smaller Birkenhead Urban Area dominates the Wirral Peninsula in the south . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Merseyside County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) are now effectively unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and several county-wide services are co-ordinated by authorities and joint-boards , such as Merseytravel ( for public transport ) , Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the Merseyside Police ( for law-enforcement ) ; as a ceremonial county , Merseyside has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . As the Lancashire county palatine boundaries remain the same as the historic boundaries , the High Sheriff of Merseyside , along with those of Lancashire and Greater Manchester are appointed within the Duchy and County Palatine of Lancaster .",
  "/wiki/River_Arun": "The River Arun ( /\u02c8\u00e6r\u0259n/ ) is a river in the English county of West Sussex . At 37 miles ( 60 km ) long , it is the longest river entirely in Sussex and one of the longest starting in Sussex after the River Medway , River Wey and River Mole . From the series of small streams that form its source in the area of St Leonard 's Forest in the Weald , the Arun flows westwards through Horsham to Nowhurst where it is joined by the North River . Turning to the south , it is joined by its main tributary , the western River Rother , and continues through a gap in the South Downs to Arundel to join the English Channel at Littlehampton . It is one of the faster flowing rivers in England , and is tidal as far inland as Pallingham Quay , 25.5 miles ( 41.0 km ) upstream from the sea at Littlehampton . The Arun gives its name to the Arun local government district of West Sussex . The first major improvements to the river were made between the 1540s and the 1570s , when Arundel became a port , and navigation up to Pallingham was improved , but barges had difficulty negotiating the flash locks that were installed . The work was carried out by Henry FitzAlan , 19th Earl of Arundel , who made the upper section toll-free . Harbour commissioners managed the lower river from Arundel to the sea from 1732 , and major improvements to keep the estuary free from silt were sanctioned by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793 . With the coming of the railways and changes in coastal shipping , Littlehampton superseded Arundel as the port of the Arun , and the Littlehampton harbour commissioners are still responsible for the river up to Arundel , collecting tolls for its use . The river above Arundel was improved after 1785 . As the main channel was toll-free , the proprietors of the scheme built two major cuts .",

  "/wiki/Ashdown_Forest": "Ashdown Forest is an ancient area of open heathland occupying the highest sandy ridge-top of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . It is situated some 30 miles ( 48 km ) south of London in the county of Sussex , England . Rising to an elevation of 732 feet ( 223 m ) above sea level , its heights provide expansive vistas across the heavily wooded hills of the Weald to the chalk escarpments of the North Downs and South Downs on the horizon . Ashdown Forest 's origins lie as a medieval hunting forest created soon after the Norman conquest of England . By 1283 the forest was fenced in by a 23 miles ( 37 km ) pale enclosing an area of some 20 square miles ( 52 km2 ; 13,000 acres ; 5,200 ha ) . Thirty-four gates and hatches in the pale , still remembered in place names such as Chuck Hatch and Chelwood Gate , allowed local people to enter to graze their livestock , collect firewood , and cut heather and bracken for animal bedding . The forest continued to be used by the monarchy and nobility for hunting into Tudor times , including notably Henry VIII , who had a hunting lodge at Bolebroke Castle , Hartfield and who courted Anne Boleyn at nearby Hever Castle . Ashdown Forest has a rich archaeological heritage . It contains much evidence of prehistoric human activity , with the earliest evidence of human occupation dating back to 50,000 years ago . There are important Bronze Age , Iron Age , and Romano-British remains . The forest was the centre of a nationally important iron industry on two occasions , during the Roman occupation of Britain and in the Tudor period when , in 1496 , England 's first blast furnace was built at Newbridge , near Coleman 's Hatch , marking the beginning of Britain 's modern iron and steel industry . In 1693 , more than half the forest was taken into private hands , with the remainder set aside as common land .",

Covering an area of 2,653 square kilometres ( 1,024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north-west , Wiltshire to the north-east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south . After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county 's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points . The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics , and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing , Cornish pilot gig rowing , sea kayaking and powerboating .",

The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest .
