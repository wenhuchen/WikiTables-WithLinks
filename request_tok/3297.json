Referred to as the Queen of Pop since the 1980s , Madonna is known for pushing the boundaries of songwriting in mainstream popular music and for the imagery she uses onstage and in music videos . She has frequently reinvented her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the recording industry . Her works have been praised by music critics and have sparked controversy . Madonna is often cited as an influence by other artists . Born and raised in Michigan , Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance . After performing as a drummer , guitarist , and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy , Madonna signed with Sire Records in 1982 and released her eponymous debut album the next year . She followed it with a series of successful albums , including global bestsellers Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) and True Blue ( 1986 ) as well as Grammy Award winners Ray of Light ( 1998 ) and Confessions on a Dance Floor ( 2005 ) . Many of her songs have reached the top of record charts worldwide , including Like a Virgin , La Isla Bonita , Like a Prayer , Vogue , Take a Bow , Frozen , Music , Hung Up , and 4 Minutes . Madonna 's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan ( 1985 ) , Dick Tracy ( 1990 ) , A League of Their Own ( 1992 ) , and Evita ( 1996 ) . While Evita earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress , many of her other films received poor reviews .

  "/wiki/Hung_Up": "Hung Up is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor ( 2005 ) . It was written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with Stuart Price , and released as the lead single from the album . Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials , the song was released as the album 's lead single on October 17 , 2005 . It has also made an appearance on her 2009 greatest hits album , Celebration . Hung Up prominently features a sample from the instrumental introduction to ABBA 's hit single Gim me ! Gim me ! Gim me ! ( A Man After Midnight ) , for which Madonna personally sought permission from ABBA 's songwriters Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus . Musically the song is influenced by pop from the 1980s , with a chugging groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time . Lyrically the song is written as a traditional dance number about a strong , independent woman who has relationship troubles . Hung Up received critical praise from reviewers , who believed that the track would restore the singer 's popularity , which had diminished following the release of her 2003 album American Life . Critics suggested it was her best dance track to date and have compared it favorably to other Madonna tracks in the same genre ."
