  "/wiki/Atari": "Atari ( /\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0ri/ ) is a brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972 , currently by Atari Interactive , a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari , SA . The original Atari , Inc. , founded in Sunnyvale , California in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney , was a pioneer in arcade games , home video game consoles , and home computers . The company 's products , such as Pong and the Atari 2600 , helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s . In 1984 , as a result of the video game crash of 1983 , the original Atari Inc. was split , and the arcade division was turned into Atari Games Inc. Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and brand name with appended text Games on arcade games , as well as rights to the original 1972-1984 arcade hardware properties . The Atari Consumer Electronics Division properties were in turn sold to Jack Tramiel 's Tramel Technology Ltd. , which then renamed itself to Atari Corporation . In 1996 , Atari Corporation reverse-merged with disk-drive manufacturer JT Storage ( JTS ) , becoming a division within the company . In 1998 , Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS , creating a new subsidiary , Atari Interactive . Infogrames Entertainment ( IESA ) bought Hasbro Interactive in 2001 and renamed it Infogrames Interactive , which intermittently published Atari branded titles . In 2003 , it renamed the division Atari Interactive . Another IESA division , Infogrames Inc. ( formerly GT Interactive ) , changed its name to Atari Inc. the same year , licensing the Atari name and logo from its fellow subsidiary . In 2008 , IESA completed its acquisition of Atari , Inc. 's outstanding stock , making it a wholly owned subsidiary . IESA renamed itself Atari , SA in 2009 .",
  "/wiki/Atari_2600": "The Atari 2600 , originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System or Atari VCS for short until November 1982 , is a home video game console from Atari , Inc . Released on September 11 , 1977 , it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges ( a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976 ) instead of dedicated hardware with games physically built into the unit . The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers , a conjoined pair of paddle controllers , and a game cartridge : initially Combat , and later Pac-Man . The Atari VCS launched with nine simple , low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges . The system found its killer app with its version of Taito 's Space Invaders in 1980 and became widely successful , leading to the creation of Activision and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco . By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983-84 , games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for , such as Pitfall ! and its scrolling sequel Pitfall II : Lost Caverns . Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600 , Pac-Man and E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , that became commercial failures and contributed to the video game crash of 1983 which ended the market relevance of the 2600 . Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel . In 1986 , the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backwards-compatible Atari 7800 , but these were not enough to turn things around , and ultimately it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry . Atari finally ended production of the Atari 2600 on January 1 , 1992 .",

  "/wiki/Atari_ST": "The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family . The initial ST model , the 520ST , saw limited release in April-June 1985 and was widely available in July . The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bitmapped color GUI , using a version of Digital Research 's GEM released in February 1985 . The 1040ST , released in 1986 , is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US $ 1 . The Atari ST is part of a mid-1980s generation of home computers that have 16 or 32-bit processors , 256 KB or more of RAM , and mouse-controlled graphical user interfaces . This generation includes the Macintosh , Commodore Amiga , Apple IIGS , and , the most advanced true 32bit Acorn Archimedes . ST officially stands for Sixteen/Thirty-two , which refers to the Motorola 68000 's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals . The ST was sold with either Atari 's color monitor or the less expensive monochrome monitor . The system 's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest-resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor . In some markets , particularly Germany , the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and desktop publishing work . Thanks to its built-in MIDI ports , the ST enjoyed success for running music sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among amateurs and well-known musicians alike . The ST was superseded by the Atari STE , Atari TT , Atari MEGA STE , and Falcon computers .",

The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",

It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom , France , Spain , and the German-speaking parts of Europe . The series spawned a total of six distinct models : The CPC464 , CPC664 , and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market . The later 464plus and 6128plus , intended to prolong the system 's lifecycle with hardware updates , were considerably less successful , as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000 . The CPC models ' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU , complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM . Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device , either a compact cassette deck or 3 inch floppy disk drive . The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour , green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit 's power supply . Additionally , a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives , printers , and memory extensions , was available . The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software . The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor , its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users , which was reflected by a wide selection of application software . During its lifetime , the CPC series sold approximately three million units .",
  "/wiki/Atari_8-bit": "The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari , Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992 . All of the machines in the family are technically similar and differ primarily in packaging . They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz , [ a ] and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips . This architecture enabled graphics and sound capabilities more advanced than most contemporary machines , and gaming on the platform was a major draw . The first-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform 's killer app . The systems launched with a series of plug and play peripherals that used the Atari SIO serial bus system , an early analog of USB . [ b ] To meet stringent FCC requirements , much of the circuitry of the original machines is enclosed in a cast aluminum block , which made them physically robust but expensive to produce . The 400 and 800 were replaced by the XL series in 1983 , then-after the company was sold and reestablished as Atari Corporation-the XE models in 1985 . The XL and XE are lighter in construction and less expensive to build , while also having Atari BASIC built-in and reducing the number of joystick ports from 4 to 2 . The 130XE , released in 1985 , increased the memory to 128K of bank-switched RAM . The Atari 8-bit computer line sold two million units during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985 .

It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",

The Spectrum was released as eight different models , ranging from the entry level with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128 KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987 ; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide ( not counting clones ) . The Spectrum was among the first mainstream-audience home computers in the UK , similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the US . The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine , the effects of which are still seen . Some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry . Licensing deals and clones followed , and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for services to British industry . The Commodore 64 , Dragon 32 , Oric-1 , Oric Atmos , BBC Micro and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s .

  "/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_video_games": "Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 American animated musical romantic fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures . The 30th Disney animated feature film and the third released during the Disney Renaissance period , it is based on the French fairy tale of the same name by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont ( who was only credited in the French dub ) , and ideas from the 1946 French film of the same name directed by Jean Cocteau . Beauty and the Beast focuses on the relationship between the Beast ( voice of Robby Benson ) , a prince who is magically transformed into a monster and his servants into household objects as punishment for his arrogance , and Belle ( voice of Paige O'Hara ) , a young woman whom he imprisons in his castle to become a prince again . To break the curse , Beast must learn to love Belle and earn her love in return before the last petal falls from an enchanted rose or else the Beast will remain a monster forever . The film also features the voices of Richard White , Jerry Orbach , David Ogden Stiers , and Angela Lansbury . Walt Disney first attempted to adapt Beauty and the Beast into an animated film during the 1930s and 1950s , but was unsuccessful . Following the success of The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) , Walt Disney Pictures decided to adapt the fairy tale , which Richard Purdum originally conceived as a non-musical . Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg eventually dismissed Purdum 's idea and ordered that the film be a musical similar to The Little Mermaid instead . The film was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise , with a screenplay by Linda Woolverton story first credited to Roger Allers . Lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken wrote the film 's songs . Ashman , who additionally served as the film 's executive producer , died of AIDS-related complications six months before the film 's release , and the film is thus dedicated to his memory . Beauty and the Beast premiered as an unfinished film at the New York Film Festival on September 29 , 1991 , followed by its theatrical release as a completed film at the El Capitan Theatre on November 13 .",
