Handheld clustered Suzu , similar to jingle bells , are used musically at Shinto ceremonies . There are ceremonies , for instance , where female performers dance with suzu bells such as those with some sort of short blade at its center . The bell 's cool tinkles are also considered psychological air-conditioning for the summer since their clear ringing is considered cool and refreshing .

Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably , n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen . Traditionally , a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between ; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today . Optionally , an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation . Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story . Noh integrates masks , costumes and various props in a dance-based performance , requiring highly trained actors and musicians . Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts , women , children , and the elderly . Written in late middle Japanese , the text vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries .

In this way , it has been known only to the nobility , although after World War II , the dance was opened to the public and has even toured around the world in 1959 . The dance is marked by its slow , precise and regal movements . The dancers wear intricate traditional Buddhist costumes , which usually include equally beautiful masks . The music and dance pattern is often repeated several times . It is performed on a square platform , usually 6 yards by 6 yards . Gerald Jonas , in his 2008 book Dancing : The pleasure power and art of movement explains that some bugaku dances depict legendary battles , others enact encounters with divine personages or mythical beasts like the phoenix ; one famous set-piece shows two dragons frolicking ( p. 102 ) . He also discusses the ancient instruction manual that describes precisely the refined movements and postures that gagaku and bugaku performers must attain . Its descriptions often use natural metaphors to describe how their movement should be . For example , the dancers might be encouraged to be like a tree swaying in a cool breeze . Amaterasu , the sun goddess had hidden herself in a cave because she was hurt by her brother Susano-o 's unacceptable behaviour .

  "/wiki/Kagura": "The epics Kojiki and Nihon Shoki describe a folktale origin for the dances . In these texts , there is a famous legendary tale about the sun goddess Amaterasu , who retreated into a cave , bringing darkness and cold to the world . Ame-no-Uzume , goddess of the dawn and of revelry , led the other gods in a wild dance , and persuaded Amaterasu to emerge to see what the ruckus was all about . Kagura is one of a number of rituals and arts said to derive from this event . Originally called kamukura or kamikura ( \u795e\u5ea7 ) , kagura began as sacred dances performed at the Imperial court by shrine maidens ( miko ) who were supposedly descendants of Ame-no-Uzume . Over time , however , these Mikagura ( \u5fa1\u795e\u697d ) performed within the sacred and private precincts of the Imperial courts , inspired popular ritual dances , called satokagura ( \u91cc\u795e\u697d ) , which , being popular forms , practiced in villages all around the country , were adapted into various other folk traditions and developed into a number of different forms . Among these are miko kagura , shishi kagura , and Ise-style and Izumo-style kagura dances . Many more variations have developed over the centuries , including some which are fairly new , and most of which have become highly secularized folk traditions . Kagura , in particular those forms that involve storytelling or reenactment of fables , is also one of the primary influences on the Noh theatre .",
