  "/wiki/Atomic_number": "The atomic number or proton number ( symbol Z ) of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element . The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element . It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus . In an uncharged atom , the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons . The sum of the atomic number Z and the number of neutrons N gives the mass number A of an atom . Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass ( and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes ) and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass , the atomic mass of any atom , when expressed in unified atomic mass units ( making a quantity called the relative isotopic mass ) , is within 1% of the whole number A . Atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers , and hence different mass numbers , are known as isotopes . A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes ( see monoisotopic elements ) , and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element ( called the relative atomic mass ) in a defined environment on Earth , determines the element 's standard atomic weight . Historically , it was these atomic weights of elements ( in comparison to hydrogen ) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century . The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl meaning number , which , before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics , merely denoted an element 's numerical place in the periodic table , whose order is approximately , but not completely , consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights . Only after 1915 , with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms , did the word Atomzahl ( and its English equivalent atomic number ) come into common use in this context .",
  "/wiki/Half-life": "Half-life ( symbol t1\u20442 ) is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half of its initial value . The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo , or how long stable atoms survive , radioactive decay . The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential or non-exponential decay . For example , the medical sciences refer to the biological half-life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body . The converse of half-life is doubling time . The original term , half-life period , dating to Ernest Rutherford 's discovery of the principle in 1907 , was shortened to half-life in the early 1950s . Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element 's half-life to studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206 . Half-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity , and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation . The accompanying table shows the reduction of a quantity as a function of the number of half-lives elapsed .",
  "/wiki/Lawrencium": "Lawrencium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Lr ( formerly Lw ) and atomic number 103 . It is named in honor of Ernest Lawrence , inventor of the cyclotron , a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements . A radioactive metal , lawrencium is the eleventh transuranic element and is also the final member of the actinide series . Like all elements with atomic number over 100 , lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles . Thirteen isotopes of lawrencium are currently known ; the most stable is 266Lr with a half-life of 11 hours , but the shorter-lived 260Lr ( half-life 2.7 minutes ) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale . Chemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table , and is a trivalent element . It thus could also be classified as the first of the 7th-period transition metals : however , its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the periodic table , having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium . This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead . In the 1950s , 1960s , and 1970s , many claims of the synthesis of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the Soviet Union and the United States . The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists , and while the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) initially established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the American team credit for the discovery , this was reevaluated in 1997 , giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but not changing the element 's name .",
  "/wiki/Hour": "An hour ( symbol : h ; also abbreviated hr . ) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as \u200b1\u204424 of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599-3,601 seconds , depending on conditions . The hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of \u200b1\u204412 of the night or daytime . Such seasonal , temporal , or unequal hours varied by season and latitude . Medieval astronomers such as al-Biruni and Sacrobosco , subsequently divided the hour into 60 minutes , each of 60 seconds . ( This derives from Babylonian astronomy , where the corresponding terms denoted the time required for the Sun 's apparent motion through the ecliptic to describe one minute or second of arc , respectively . In present terms , the Babylonian degree of time was thus four minutes long , the minute of time was thus four seconds long and the second 1/15 of a second . ) Equal or equinoctial hours were taken as \u200b1\u204424 of the day as measured from noon to noon ; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it \u200b1\u204424 of the mean solar day . Since this unit was not constant due to long term variations in the Earth 's rotation , the hour was finally separated from the Earth 's rotation and defined in terms of the atomic or physical second . In the modern metric system , hours are an accepted unit of time defined as 3,600 atomic seconds . However , on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative leap second , [ a ] making it last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds , in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1 , which is based on measurements of the mean solar day .",
  "/wiki/Astatine": "Astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol At and atomic number 85 . It is the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth 's crust , occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements . All of astatine 's isotopes are short-lived ; the most stable is astatine-210 , with a half-life of 8.1 hours . A sample of the pure element has never been assembled , because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity . The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty . Many of them have been estimated based on the element 's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine , and a member of the halogens ( the group of elements including fluorine , chlorine , bromine , and iodine ) . Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal ; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine . Chemically , several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine . It also shows some metallic behavior , including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution ( unlike the lighter halogens ) . The first synthesis of the element was in 1940 by Dale R. Corson , Kenneth Ross MacKenzie , and Emilio G. Segr\u00e8 at the University of California , Berkeley , who named it from the Greek astatos ( \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ) , meaning unstable . Four isotopes of astatine were subsequently found to be naturally occurring , although much less than one gram is present at any given time in the Earth 's crust . Neither the most stable isotope astatine-210 , nor the medically useful astatine-211 , occur naturally ; they can only be produced synthetically , usually by bombarding bismuth-209 with alpha particles .",

Chemistry experiments have confirmed that nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to ytterbium in the periodic table . The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known : they are mostly only known in aqueous solution . Before nobelium 's discovery , it was predicted that it would show a stable +2 oxidation state as well as the +3 state characteristic of the other actinides : these predictions were later confirmed , as the +2 state is much more stable than the +3 state in aqueous solution and it is difficult to keep nobelium in the +3 state .

It is the second-most electropositive element , behind only caesium , and is the second rarest naturally occurring element ( after astatine ) . The isotopes of francium decay quickly into astatine , radium , and radon . The electronic structure of a francium atom is [ Rn ] 7s1 , and so the element is classed as an alkali metal . Bulk francium has never been viewed . Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column , it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal , if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid . Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable , since the extreme heat of decay caused by its short half-life would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element . Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France ( from which the element takes its name ) in 1939 . It was the last element first discovered in nature , rather than by synthesis .

  "/wiki/Second": "The second ( symbol : s , abbreviation : sec ) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units ( SI ) , commonly understood and historically defined as \u200b1\u204486400 of a day - this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours , then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each . Analog clocks and watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces , representing seconds ( and minutes ) , and a second hand to mark the passage of time in seconds . Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter . The second is also part of several other units of measurement like meters per second for velocity , meters per second per second for acceleration , and cycles per second for frequency . Although the historical definition of the unit was based on this division of the Earth 's rotation cycle , the formal definition in the International System of Units ( SI ) is a much steadier timekeeper : it is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency \u2206\u03bdCs , the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom , to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz , which is equal to s\u22121 . Because the Earth 's rotation varies and is also slowing ever so slightly , a leap second is periodically added to clock time [ nb 1 ] to keep clocks in sync with Earth 's rotation . Multiples of seconds are usually counted in hours and minutes . Fractions of a second are usually counted in tenths or hundredths . In scientific work , small fractions of a second are counted in milliseconds ( thousandths ) , microseconds ( millionths ) , nanoseconds ( billionths ) , and sometimes smaller units of a second . An everyday experience with small fractions of a second is a 1-gigahertz microprocessor which has a cycle time of 1 nanosecond . Camera shutter speeds are often expressed in fractions of a second , such as \u200b1\u204430 second or \u200b1\u20441000 second .

Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements . The radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable , and since 2005 , only five ( possibly six ) atoms of the isotope 294Og have been detected . Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds , theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions , including some surprising ones . For example , although oganesson is a member of group 18 ( the noble gases ) - the first synthetic element to be so - it may be significantly reactive , unlike all the other elements of that group . It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects . On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element and the last one of period 7 .",
  "/wiki/Microsecond": "A microsecond is an SI unit of time equal to one millionth ( 0.000001 or 10\u22126 or \u200b1\u20441,000,000 ) of a second . Its symbol is \u03bcs , sometimes simplified to us when Unicode is not available . A microsecond is equal to 1000 nanoseconds or \u200b1\u20441,000 of a millisecond . Because the next SI prefix is 1000 times larger , measurements of 10\u22125 and 10\u22124 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of microseconds ."
