Naruse is known for imbuing his films with a bleak and pessimistic outlook . He made primarily shomin-geki ( working-class drama ) films with female protagonists , portrayed by actresses such as Hideko Takamine , Kinuyo Tanaka , and Setsuko Hara . Because of his focus on family drama and the intersection of traditional and modern Japanese culture , his films are frequently compared with the works of Yasujir\u014d Ozu . His reputation is just behind Akira Kurosawa , Kenji Mizoguchi , and Ozu in Japan and internationally ; his work remains less well known outside Japan than theirs . Among Naruse 's most revered films are Late Chrysanthemums ( 1954 ) , Floating Clouds ( 1955 ) , and When a Woman Ascends the Stairs ( 1960 ) . Akira Kurosawa referred to Naruse 's style of melodrama as like a great river with a calm surface and a raging current in its depths .",

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema . Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936 , following a brief stint as a painter . After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter , he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata ( a.k.a . Judo Saga ) . After the war , the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel ( 1948 ) , in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role , cemented the director 's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan . The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films . Rashomon , which premiered in Tokyo , became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival . The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry , which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers . Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , including a number of highly regarded ( and often adapted ) films , such as Ikiru ( 1952 ) , Seven Samurai ( 1954 ) and Yojimbo ( 1961 ) .

Chanbara is a sub-category of jidaigeki , which equates to period drama . Jidaigeki may refer to a story set in a historical period , though not necessarily dealing with a samurai character or depicting swordplay . While earlier samurai period pieces were more dramatic rather than action-based , samurai movies produced post World War II have become more action-based , with darker and more violent characters . Post war samurai epics tended to portray psychologically or physically scarred warriors . Akira Kurosawa stylized and exaggerated death and violence in samurai epics . His samurai , and many others portrayed in film , were solitary figures , more often concerned with concealing their martial abilities , rather than showing them off . Historically , the genre is usually set during the Tokugawa era ( 1600-1868 ) . The samurai film hence often focuses on the end of an entire way of life for the samurai : many of the films deal with masterless r\u014dnin , or samurai dealing with changes to their status resulting from a changing society . Samurai films were constantly made into the early 1970s , but by then , overexposure on television , the aging of the big stars of the genre , and the continued decline of the mainstream Japanese film industry put a halt to most of the production of this genre .",

The incident has since become legendary . The story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless after their daimy\u014d ( feudal lord ) Asano Naganori was compelled to perform seppuku ( ritual suicide ) for assaulting a court official named Kira Yoshinaka , whose title was K\u014dzuke no suke . After waiting and planning for a year , the r\u014dnin avenged their master 's honor by killing Kira . They were then themselves obliged to commit seppuku for the crime of murder . This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty , sacrifice , persistence , and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives . The popularity of the tale grew during the Meiji era , in which Japan underwent rapid modernization , and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity . Fictionalized accounts of the tale of the forty-seven r\u014dnin are known as Ch\u016bshingura . The story was popularized in numerous plays , including in the genres of bunraku and kabuki . Because of the censorship laws of the shogunate in the Genroku era , which forbade portrayal of current events , the names were changed . While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some , [ who ? ] the first Ch\u016bshingura was written some 50 years after the event , and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the Ch\u016bshingura survive .",
