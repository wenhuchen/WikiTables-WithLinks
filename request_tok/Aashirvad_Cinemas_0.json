Modern Hindi is the standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language , which itself is based primarily on the Khariboli dialect of Delhi and other nearby areas of Northern India . Hindi , written in the Devanagari script , is one of the two official languages of the Government of India , along with the English language . It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India . Hindi is the lingua franca of the Hindi belt and to a lesser extent other parts of India ( usually in a simplified or pidginised variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi ) . Outside India , several other languages are recognised officially as Hindi but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language described here and instead descend from other dialects , such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri . Such languages include Fiji Hindi , which is official in Fiji , and Caribbean Hindustani , which is spoken in Trinidad and Tobago , Guyana , and Suriname . Apart from the script and formal vocabulary , spoken Hindi is mutually intelligible with standard Urdu , another recognised register of Hindustani as both share a common colloquial base . As a linguistic variety , Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world , after Mandarin , Spanish and English . Hindi alongside Urdu as Hindustani is the third most-spoken language in the world , after Mandarin and English .",

Sinhala is also spoken as the first language by other ethnic groups in Sri Lanka , totalling about 4 million . Sinhala is written using the Sinhala script , which is one of the Brahmic scripts , a descendant of the ancient Indian Brahmi script closely related to the Kadamba script . Sinhala is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka . Sinhala , along with Pali , played a major role in the development of Theravada Buddhist literature . The oldest Sinhalese Prakrit inscriptions found are from the third to second century BCE following the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka , the oldest extant literary works date from the ninth century . The closest relative of Sinhala is the Maldivian language . Sinhala has two main varieties - written and spoken , and is a great example of the linguistic phenomenon known as diglossia .",
  "/wiki/Chinese_language": "Chinese ( simplified Chinese : \u6c49\u8bed ; traditional Chinese : \u6f22\u8a9e ; pinyin : H\u00e0ny\u01d4 ; literally : 'Han language ' ; or especially though not exclusively for written Chinese : \u4e2d\u6587 ; Zh\u014dngw\u00e9n ; 'Chinese writing ' ) is a group of languages that forms the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan languages . Chinese languages are spoken by the ethnic Chinese majority and many minority ethnic groups in China . About 1.2 billion people ( around 16% of the world 's population ) speak some form of Chinese as their first language . The varieties of Chinese are usually considered by native speakers to be regional variants of ethnic Chinese speech , without consideration of whether they are mutually intelligible . Due to their lack of mutual intelligibility , linguists generally describe them as distinct languages , perhaps hundreds , sometimes noting that they are more varied than the Romance languages . [ b ] Investigation of the historical relationships among the Sinitic languages is just getting started . Currently , most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups , based on often superficial phonetic developments , of which the most populous by far is Mandarin ( about 800 million speakers , e.g . Southwestern Mandarin ) , followed by Min ( 75 million , e.g . Southern Min ) , Wu ( 74 million , e.g . Shanghainese ) , Yue ( 68 million , e.g . Cantonese ) . These groups are unintelligible to each other , and generally many of their subgroups are mutually unintelligible as well ( e.g. , not only is Min Chinese a family of mutually unintelligible languages , but Southern Min itself is not a single language ) .",
