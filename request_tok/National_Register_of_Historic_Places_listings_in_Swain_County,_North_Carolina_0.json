  "/wiki/Cheoah_Dam": "The Cheoah Dam is a hydroelectric complex located in Graham and Swain counties , North Carolina , on the Little Tennessee River between river miles 51 and 52 . The Cheoah Development consists of a dam and powerhouse , the first of several constructed by the Tallassee Power Company , now Tapoco . The Cheoah project began in 1916 as a construction camp at the Narrows where the Little Tennessee River flowed through a narrow gorge , and was completed in 1919 . Cheoah Dam helps form the long , narrow Cheoah Reservoir , which covers the approximately 644 acres ( 261 ha ) of the normal full pool area and a drainage area of 1,608 square miles ( 4,160 km2 ) . The elevation of Cheoah Reservoir is 1,276.8 feet ( 389.2 m ) ( USGS ) . A scenic highway runs the length of the reservoir . The water inflow for Cheoah , like Calderwood and Chilhowee , is primarily dependent on releases from TVA 's Fontana Dam . Fontana Dam is the primary flow control facility for the lower Little Tennessee River . Tapoco built and operated the Cheoah Development until 2012 when it was sold to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners , forming Brookfield Smoky Mountain Hydropower . When completed , the 225-foot ( 69 m ) dam was the world 's highest overflow dam . The turbines were the largest in the world , and the 150,000-volt transmission line had the highest voltage and the longest span for a transmission line - 5,010 feet ( 1,530 m ) across the river below Cheoah Dam . The dam and associated structures were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 .",

The Smithsonian Institution developed the site number system in the 1930s and 1940s . ( Trinomials are now assigned by the individual states . ) The 48 states then in the union were assigned numbers in alphabetical order . Alaska was assigned number 49 and Hawaii was assigned number 50 after those states were admitted to the union . There are no Smithsonian trinomial numbers assigned for the District of Columbia or any United States territories . Most states use trinomials of the form nnAAnnnn , but some specify a space or dash between parts of the identifier , i.e. , nn AA nnnn or nn-AA-nnnn . Some states use variations of the trinomial system . Arizona , California , Connecticut , Maine , Rhode Island and Vermont use two-letter abbreviations of the state name instead of the Smithsonian number . Alaska uses three-letter abbreviations for USGS map quadrangles in place of the county code .
