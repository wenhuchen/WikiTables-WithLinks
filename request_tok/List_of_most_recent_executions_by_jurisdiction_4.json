  "/wiki/Aggravating_factor": "Aggravation , in law , is any circumstance attending the commission of a crime or tort which increases its guilt or enormity or adds to its injurious consequences , but which is above and beyond the essential constituents of the crime or tort itself . Aggravated assault , for example , is usually differentiated from simple assault by the offender 's intent ( e.g. , to murder or to rape ) , the extent of injury to the victim , or the use of a deadly weapon . An aggravating circumstance is a kind of attendant circumstance and the opposite of an extenuating or mitigating circumstance , which decreases guilt . In the UK , the Criminal Justice Act 2003 requires a court to consider ( a ) relevant previous convictions , ( b ) racial or religious aggravation , and ( c ) hostility towards the victim or to persons generally based on sexual orientation ( or presumed sexual orientation ) or disability ( or presumed disability ) when determining sentence for a conviction . The antonym of aggravation is mitigation .",
  "/wiki/Lethal_injection": "Lethal injection is the practice of injecting one or more drugs into a person ( typically a barbiturate , paralytic , and potassium solution ) for the express purpose of causing rapid death . The main application for this procedure is capital punishment , but the term may also be applied in a broader sense to include euthanasia and other forms of suicide . The drugs cause the person to become unconscious , stops their breathing , and causes a heart arrhythmia , in that order . First developed in the United States , it is now also a legal method of execution in China , Thailand , Guatemala , Taiwan , the Maldives , Nigeria and Vietnam , though Guatemala has not conducted an execution since 2000 and the Maldives has never carried out an execution since its independence . Although Taiwan permits lethal injection as an execution method , no executions have been carried out in this manner , most likely due to drug shortages ; the same is true for Nigeria . Lethal injection was also used in the Philippines until the country re-abolished the death penalty in 2006 .",

Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows , and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape . Widespread and systematic rape ( e.g. , war rape ) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict . These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes . Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a targeted ethnic group .

  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",
  "/wiki/Kansas": "Kansas /\u02c8k\u00e6nz\u0259s/ ( listen ) is a U.S. state in the Midwestern United States . Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita , with its most populated county and largest employment center being Johnson County . Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north ; Missouri on the east ; Oklahoma on the south ; and Colorado on the west . Kansas is named after the Kansas River , which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks . The tribe 's name ( natively kk\u0105 : ze ) is often said to mean people of the ( south ) wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning . For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",

There are also many species of tree frogs , and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish .

Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state , including four that are federally recognized , ten that are state recognized , and four that have not received recognition ."
