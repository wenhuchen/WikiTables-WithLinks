Born in Edo , he was the second son of a daimy\u014d of the Akizuki clan , who controlled part of Hy\u016bga Province . His mother was a granddaughter of the fourth head of Yonezawa . His childhood names were Matsusabur\u014d ( \u677e\u4e09\u90ce ) and Naomatsu ( \u76f4\u677e ) . At age 16 he was adopted by Uesugi Shigesada , then daimy\u014d of Yonezawa , and in 1767 he succeeded Shigesada . After retirement , he adopted the g\u014d , or pen name , Y\u014dzan ( \u9df9\u5c71 ) . Today , he is best remembered for his financial reforms , and he is often cited as an example of a good governor of a domain . Yonezawa had been in debt for roughly a hundred years when Harunori took over ; Shigesada even considered returning the domain to the shogunate as a last resort . However , he was convinced by his father-in-law , the daimy\u014d of Owari Province , to instead resign as daimy\u014d . It was under these conditions that Harunori came to be daimy\u014d of Yonezawa . He introduced strict disciplinary measures , and ordered the execution of several kar\u014d ( advisors ) who opposed his plans . As a result of various measures he took , Yonezawa became fairly prosperous , and did not suffer much from the famine which swept Japan in the Tenmei era ( 1781-1789 ) .",
