While Custer was not born in Monroe , he lived much of his early childhood there with relatives and attended the schools in Monroe . During his youth , he met his future wife Elizabeth Bacon , whom he returned to marry in 1864 . Custer left Monroe to attend the United States Military Academy and fight in the Civil War . Because of his hard work and success during the war - as well as the Union 's need for officers - he was promoted to the rank of Major General and became a very well-known military figure . After the Civil War , he fought in the Indian Wars in the West . His previous accomplishments in the Civil War , however , were overshadowed by his catastrophic defeat and death at the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25 , 1876 . To honor him , a $ 24,000 , 14-foot ( 4.27 m ) bronze equestrian statue , sculpted by Edward Clark Potter , was unveiled in Monroe in June 1910 by President William Howard Taft and the widowed Elizabeth Bacon Custer .

It is the southernmost , shallowest , and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time . At its deepest point Lake Erie is 210 feet ( 64 metres ) deep . Situated on the International Boundary between Canada and the United States , Lake Erie 's northern shore is the Canadian province of Ontario , specifically the Ontario Peninsula , with the U.S. states of Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York on its western , southern , and eastern shores . These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries . The lake was named by the Erie people , a Native American people who lived along its southern shore . The tribal name erie is a shortened form of the Iroquoian word erielhonan , meaning long tail . Situated below Lake Huron , Erie 's primary inlet is the Detroit River . The main natural outflow from the lake is via the Niagara River , which provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U.S. as it spins huge turbines near Niagara Falls at Lewiston , New York and Queenston , Ontario . Some outflow occurs via the Welland Canal , part of the St. Lawrence Seaway , which diverts water for ship passages from Port Colborne , Ontario on Lake Erie , to St. Catharines on Lake Ontario , an elevation difference of 326 ft ( 99 m ) . Lake Erie 's environmental health has been an ongoing concern for decades , with issues such as overfishing , pollution , algae blooms , and eutrophication generating headlines .",
