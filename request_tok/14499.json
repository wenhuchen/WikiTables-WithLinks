  "/wiki/Vermont_Supreme_Court": "The Vermont Supreme Court is the highest judicial authority of the U.S. state of Vermont . Unlike most other states , the Vermont Supreme Court hears appeals directly from the trial courts , as Vermont has no intermediate appeals court . The Court consists of a chief justice and four associate justices ; the Court mostly hears appeals of cases that have been decided by other courts . The Supreme Court justices are appointed by the Governor of Vermont with confirmation by the Vermont Senate . When a judicial vacancy occurs , the judicial nominating board submits to the governor the names of as many persons as it deems qualified for appointment . All Supreme Court justices come up for retention at the same time every six years . The next retention date is March 31 , 2023 . The Joint Committee on Judicial Retention reviews a justice 's performance during the previous term and recommends to the Vermont General Assembly whether the justice should be retained . The committee consists of four House members appointed by the Speaker of the House and four Senate members appointed by the Committee on Committees . After open debate and discussion , the General Assembly votes by secret ballot , with a majority having to vote against reappointment for a justice to be denied another term . In addition to the retention process , any Vermont judge may be removed at any time in one of two ways : ( 1 ) Judges may be impeached by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly and convicted by a two-thirds vote of the Senate , and ( 2 ) a Judicial Conduct Board investigates complaints of judicial misconduct or disability and recommends any necessary action to the Supreme Court . The current chief justice is Paul L. Reiber .",

Cir . 2001 ) , was a noted American antitrust law case in which the U.S. government accused Microsoft of illegally maintaining its monopoly position in the PC market primarily through the legal and technical restrictions it put on the abilities of PC manufacturers ( OEMs ) and users to uninstall Internet Explorer and use other programs such as Netscape and Java . At trial , the district court ruled that Microsoft 's actions constituted unlawful monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 , and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit affirmed most of the district court 's judgments . The plaintiffs alleged that Microsoft had abused monopoly power on Intel-based personal computers in its handling of operating system and web browser integration . The issue central to the case was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship Internet Explorer ( IE ) web browser software with its Windows operating system . Bundling them is alleged to have been responsible for Microsoft 's victory in the browser wars as every Windows user had a copy of IE . It was further alleged that this restricted the market for competing web browsers ( such as Netscape Navigator or Opera ) , since it typically took a while to download or purchase such software at a store . Underlying these disputes were questions over whether Microsoft had manipulated its application programming interfaces to favor IE over third-party web browsers , Microsoft 's conduct in forming restrictive licensing agreements with original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) , and Microsoft 's intent in its course of conduct . Microsoft stated that the merging of Windows and IE was the result of innovation and competition , that the two were now the same product and inextricably linked , and that consumers were receiving the benefits of IE free . Opponents countered that IE was still a separate product which did not need to be tied to Windows , since a separate version of IE was available for Mac OS . They also asserted that IE was not really free because its development and marketing costs may have inflated the price of Windows .",
