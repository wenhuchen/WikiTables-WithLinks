In 1989 , the name changed to BBC Acorn User , reflecting the fact that the commercial arm of the BBC , BBC Enterprises , took control of Redwood to expand its publishing activities . The magazine lost the BBC branding when it was sold to Europress , publisher of rival title The Micro User , coinciding with its January 1994 issue . The magazine later incorporated Acorn Computing and Archimedes World magazines .
