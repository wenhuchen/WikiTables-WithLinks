Set in the American South against the backdrop of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era , the film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara , the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner . It follows her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes , who is married to his cousin , Melanie Hamilton , and her subsequent marriage to Rhett Butler . The leading roles are played by Vivien Leigh ( Scarlett ) , Clark Gable ( Rhett ) , Leslie Howard ( Ashley ) , and Olivia de Havilland ( Melanie ) . Production was difficult from the start . Filming was delayed for two years because of Selznick 's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett Butler , and the search for Scarlett led to 1,400 women being interviewed for the part . The original screenplay was written by Sidney Howard and underwent many revisions by several writers in an attempt to get it down to a suitable length . The original director , George Cukor , was fired shortly after filming began and was replaced by Fleming , who in turn was briefly replaced by Sam Wood while Fleming took some time off due to exhaustion . The film received positive reviews upon its release in December 1939 , although some reviewers found it overlong . The casting was widely praised , and many reviewers found Leigh especially suited to her role as Scarlett . At the 12th Academy Awards , it received ten Academy Awards ( eight competitive , two honorary ) from thirteen nominations , including wins for Best Picture , Best Director ( Fleming ) , Best Adapted Screenplay ( posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard ) , Best Actress ( Leigh ) , and Best Supporting Actress ( Hattie McDaniel , becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award ) .",

With their heavy , guitar-driven sound , they are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal , although their style drew from a variety of influences , including blues and folk music . After changing their name from the New Yardbirds , Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom . Although the group were initially unpopular with critics , they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums released over ten years , from Led Zeppelin ( 1969 ) to In Through the Out Door ( 1979 ) . Their untitled fourth studio album , commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV ( 1971 ) , and featuring the song Stairway to Heaven , is among the most popular and influential works in rock music , and helped to secure the group 's popularity . Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin 's music , particularly early in their career , while Plant generally supplied the lyrics . Jones 's keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group 's catalogue , which featured increasing experimentation . The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery . Although they remained commercially and critically successful , their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s , and the group disbanded following Bonham 's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980 . In the decades that followed , the former members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions .

The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence , with frontman Roger McGuinn ( known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967 ) remaining the sole consistent member . Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like the Beatles , the Beach Boys , and the Rolling Stones for a short period in the mid-1960s , the Byrds are today considered by critics to be nearly as influential as those bands . Their signature blend of clear harmony singing and McGuinn 's jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar was absorbed into the vocabulary of rock and has continued to be influential . Initially , the band pioneered the musical genre of folk rock as a popular format in 1965 , by melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music on their debut album and the hit singles Mr. Tambourine Man and Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! . As the 1960s progressed , the band was influential in originating psychedelic rock and raga rock , with their song Eight Miles High and the albums Fifth Dimension ( 1966 ) , Younger Than Yesterday ( 1967 ) and The Notorious Byrd Brothers ( 1968 ) . They also played a pioneering role in the development of country rock , with the 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo representing their fullest immersion into the genre . The original five-piece lineup of the Byrds consisted of Jim McGuinn ( lead guitar , vocals ) , Gene Clark ( tambourine , vocals ) , David Crosby ( rhythm guitar , vocals ) , Chris Hillman ( bass guitar , vocals ) , and Michael Clarke ( drums ) . This version of the band was relatively short-lived ; by early 1966 , Clark had left due to problems associated with anxiety and his increasing isolation within the group .

  "/wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock ( also called alternative music , alt-rock , alt-pop or simply alternative ) is a term used to categorize rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1980s . In this instance , the word alternative refers to the genre 's distinction from mainstream , or commercial rock or pop music . The term 's original meaning was broader , referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent , DIY ethos of punk rock , which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music . In September of 1988 , Billboard magazine introduced Alternative Songs into their charting system rather than continue incorporating these artists into the existing rock and pop charts . By then alternative had become a catch-all description for both successful artists ( e.g . U2 and R.E.M . ) , as well as music from underground , independent , or non-commercial rock artists that received some level of mainstream recognition . Although the genre evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s , music anticipating the sound of the genre can be found as early as the 1960s , with bands such as the Velvet Underground and artists such as Syd Barrett . Since the early 1990s the term has often been misused to market an artist 's image or music toward consumers seeking to distinguish their tastes from mainstream pop or rock music . Traditionally , alternative rock broadly consisted of music that differed greatly in terms of its sound , social context and regional roots . Throughout the 1980s , magazines and zines , college radio airplay , and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock , helping to define a number of distinct styles ( and music scenes ) such as noise pop , indie rock , grunge , and shoegaze . Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands , such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and R.E.M. , were signed to major labels .",

Screamo is strongly influenced by hardcore punk and characterized by the use of screamed vocals . Lyrical themes usually include emotional pain , death , romance , and human rights . In the 2000s , the term screamo has often mistakenly been used as an umbrella term for any music that features screamed vocals .",
  "/wiki/Pop_punk": "Pop punk ( also known as punk-pop , pop punk rock or pop-punk ) is a genre of rock music that combines influences of pop music with punk rock . Fast tempos , prominent electric guitars with distortion , and power chord changes are typically played under pop-influenced melodies and vocal styles with lighthearted lyrical themes including boredom , rebellion and teenage romance . Early punk rock bands such as Ramones , Buzzcocks , the Dickies , Stiff Little Fingers , Generation X , the Adicts , and the Undertones all had strong sense of melody , taking some cues from pop rock and power pop . In the early-mid 1980s , punk rock bands such as the Descendents combined punk rock and hardcore punk with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes involving humor , girls , and teenage confusion . 1980s punk bands like Husker Du and Bad Religion influenced later pop punk music . Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s , especially in California where independent record labels ( most notably Lookout ! Records ) adopted a do it yourself ( DIY ) approach to releasing music . Lookout ! Records signed punk rock and pop punk bands like Green Day , Screeching Weasel , The Queers , Rancid , and The Mr. T Experience . In the mid-1990s , punk rock broke into the mainstream with the success of Green Day , Rancid , and the Offspring . During this time , these bands sold millions of records and received extensive radio and television airplay . In the late 1990s , bands such as Lit , Eve 6 , and Blink-182 became mainstream , with the latter considered a key group in its development , providing a massive influential appeal to countless bands for years to come .",

When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976 , acts such as Television , Patti Smith , and the Ramones in New York City ; the Sex Pistols , the Clash , and the Damned in London ; and the Saints in Brisbane formed its vanguard .
