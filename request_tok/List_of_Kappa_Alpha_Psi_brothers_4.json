  "/wiki/Coca-Cola": "Coca-Cola , or Coke , is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company . Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine , it was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler , whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century . The drink 's name refers to two of its original ingredients : coca leaves , and kola nuts ( a source of caffeine ) . The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret , although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published . The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate , which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world . The bottlers , who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company , produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate , in combination with filtered water and sweeteners . A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce ( 350 ml ) can contains 38 grams ( 1.3 oz ) of sugar ( usually in the form of high fructose corn syrup ) . The bottlers then sell , distribute , and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores , restaurants , and vending machines throughout the world . The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors . The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name . The most common of these is Diet Coke , along with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola , Diet Coke Caffeine-Free , Coca-Cola Zero Sugar , Coca-Cola Cherry , Coca-Cola Vanilla , and special versions with lemon , lime , and coffee . Based on Interbrand 's best global brand study of 2015 , Coca-Cola was the world 's third most valuable brand , after Apple and Google ."
