  "/wiki/Genre": "Genre ( Pronounced / ( d ) \u0292\u0251n.\u0279\u0259/ ) ( from French genre , meaning 'kind , sort ' ) is any form or type of communication in any mode ( written , spoken , digital , artistic , etc . ) with socially-agreed-upon conventions developed over time . Genre is most popularly known as a category of literature , music , or other forms of art or entertainment , whether written or spoken , audio or visual , based on some set of stylistic criteria , yet genres can be aesthetic , rhetorical , communicative , or functional . Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones . Often , works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions . Stand-alone texts , works , or pieces of communication may have individual styles , but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions . Some genres may have rigid , strictly adhered-to guidelines , while others may show great flexibility . Genre began as an absolute classification system for ancient Greek literature , as set out in Aristotle 's Poetics . For Aristotle , poetry ( odes , epics , etc . ) , prose , and performance each had specific design features that supported appropriate content of each genre . Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy , for example , and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best .

  "/wiki/Romantic_comedy": "Romantic comedy ( portmanteaus : romedy , romcom , rom-com or lovecome ) is a subgenre of comedy and slice-of-life fiction , focusing on lighthearted , humorous plot lines centered on romantic ideas , such as how true love is able to surmount most obstacles . One dictionary definition is a funny movie , play , or television program about a love story that ends happily . Another definition suggests that its primary distinguishing feature is a love plot in which two sympathetic and well-matched lovers are united or reconciled . Romantic comedy films are a certain genre of comedy films as well as of romance films , and may also have elements of screwball comedies . However , a romantic comedy is classified as a film with two genres , not a single new genre . Some television series can also be classified as romantic comedies . In a typical romantic comedy the two lovers tend to be young , likeable , and seemingly meant for each other , yet they are kept apart by some complicating circumstance ( e.g. , class differences , parental interference , a previous girlfriend or boyfriend ) until , surmounting all obstacles , they are finally reunited . A fairy-tale-style happy ending is a typical feature .",
  "/wiki/Comedy-drama": "Comedy-drama or dramedy ( a portmanteau of drama and comedy ) , is a genre of dramatic works ( including film , television , and theatre ) in which plot elements are a combination of comedy and drama .

  "/wiki/Sitcom": "A sitcom , clipping for situational comedy ( situation comedy in the U.S. ) , is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode . Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy , where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch , and stand-up comedy , where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience . Sitcoms originated in radio , but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms . A situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience , depending on the programme 's production format . The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track . During filming productions , the laugh track is usually pre-recorded . Critics disagree over the utility of the term sitcom in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century . Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track , thus often resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the traditional sitcom . Other topics of debate have included whether or not cartoons , such as The Simpsons or Family Guy , can be classified as sitcoms .",

  "/wiki/Romance_film": "Romance films or romance movies are romantic love stories recorded in visual media for broadcast in theaters and on TV that focus on passion , emotion , and the affectionate romantic involvement of the main characters and the journey that their love takes them through dating , courtship or marriage . Romance films make the romantic love story or the search for strong and pure love and romance the main plot focus . Occasionally , romance lovers face obstacles such as finances , physical illness , various forms of discrimination , psychological restraints or family that threaten to break their union of love . As in all quite strong , deep , and close romantic relationships , tensions of day-to-day life , temptations ( of infidelity ) , and differences in compatibility enter into the plots of romantic films . Romantic films often explore the essential themes of love at first sight , young with older love , unrequited romantic love , obsessive love , sentimental love , spiritual love , forbidden love/romance , platonic love , sexual and passionate love , sacrificial love , explosive and destructive love , and tragic love . Romantic films serve as great escapes and fantasies for viewers , especially if the two people finally overcome their difficulties , declare their love , and experience life happily ever after , implied by a reunion and final kiss . In romantic television series , the development of such romantic relationships may play out over many episodes , and different characters may become intertwined in different romantic arcs .",
  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",
  "/wiki/Comedy_film": "A comedy film is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor . These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect . Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending ( black comedy being an exception ) . One of the oldest genres in film - and derived from the classical comedy in theatre - , some of the very first silent movies were comedies , as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions , without requiring sound . When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s , comedy films took another swing , as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue . Comedy , compared with other film genres , puts much more focus on individual stars , with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity . While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse , others contain political or social commentary ( such as The King of Comedy and Wag the Dog ) .",

  "/wiki/Starved": "Starved is an American television sitcom that aired for one season on FX for seven episodes in 2005 .

Its characters included those with bulimia , anorexia , and binge eating disorder . Eric Schaeffer created the show as well as writing , starring in and directing it , based upon his own struggle with eating disorders . In addition to his own life experiences , Schaeffer also drew upon the experiences of the other members of the principal cast , each of whom coincidentally had struggled with food issues of their own . Starved was the lead-in of FX 's hour-long Other Side of Comedy block with It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia . FX executives wanted to use the two series to begin building comedy programming and broaden the network 's demographic . The series debuted on August 4 , 2005 to poor critical reviews and was cancelled in October 2005 , when FX picked Sunny over Starved for renewal .",
  "/wiki/Reality_television": "Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents purportedly unscripted real-life situations , often starring unknown individuals rather than professional actors . Reality television came to prominence in the late 1990s and the early 2000s with the global successes of the series Survivor , Idols , and Big Brother , all of which became global franchises . Reality television shows tend to be interspersed with confessionals , short interview segments in which cast members reflect on or provide context for the events being depicted on-screen . Competition-based reality shows typically feature gradual elimination of participants , either by a panel of judges or by the viewership of the show . Documentaries , television news , sports television , talk shows , and traditional game shows are generally not classified as reality television . Some genres of television programming that predate the reality television boom have been retroactively classified as reality television , including hidden camera shows , talent-search shows , documentary series about ordinary people , high-concept game shows , home improvement shows , and court shows featuring real-life cases . Reality television has faced significant criticism since its rise in popularity . Critics argue that reality television shows do not accurately reflect reality , in ways both implicit ( participants being placed in artificial situations ) , and deceptive ( misleading editing , participants being coached on behavior , storylines generated ahead of time , scenes being staged ) . Some shows have been accused of rigging the favorite or underdog to win . Other criticisms of reality television shows include that they are intended to humiliate or exploit participants ; that they make stars out of untalented people unworthy of fame , infamous figures , or both ; and that they glamorize vulgarity .",

  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance : a play , opera , mime , ballet , etc. , performed in a theatre , or on radio or television . Considered as a genre of poetry in general , the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle 's Poetics ( c. 335 BC ) - the earliest work of dramatic theory . The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 , drama ) , which is derived from I do ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 , drao ) . The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy . In English ( as was the analogous case in many other European languages ) , the word play or game ( translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus ) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare 's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre . The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era . Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example , Zola 's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin ( 1873 ) or Chekhov 's Ivanov ( 1887 ) . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media . The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance . May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . The enactment of drama in theatre , performed by actors on a stage before an audience , presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception . The structure of dramatic texts , unlike other forms of literature , is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception ."
