  "/wiki/2_ft_and_600_mm_gauge_railways": "Two foot and 600 mm gauge railways are narrow gauge railways with track gauges of 2 ft ( 610 mm ) and 600 mm ( 1 ft 11 5\u20448 in ) , respectively . Railways with similar , less common track gauges , such as 1 ft 11 3\u20444 in ( 603 mm ) and 1 ft 11 1\u20442 in ( 597 mm ) , are grouped with 2 ft and 600 mm gauge railways .",
  "/wiki/Narrow_gauge_railway": "A narrow-gauge railway ( narrow-gauge railroad in the US ) is a railway with a track gauge narrower than standard 1,435 mm ( 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ) . Most narrow-gauge railways are between 600 mm ( 1 ft 11 5\u20448 in ) and 1,067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) . Since narrow-gauge railways are usually built with tighter curves , smaller structure gauges , and lighter rails , they can be less costly to build , equip , and operate than standard- or broad-gauge railways ( particularly in mountainous or difficult terrain ) . Lower-cost narrow-gauge railways are often built to serve industries and communities where the traffic potential would not justify the cost of a standard- or broad-gauge line . Narrow-gauge railways have specialized use in mines and other environments where a small structure gauge necessitates a small loading gauge . They also have more general applications . Non-industrial , narrow-gauge mountain railways are ( or were ) common in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and the Pacific Cordillera of Canada , Mexico , Switzerland , the former Yugoslavia , Greece , and Costa Rica . In some countries , narrow gauge is the standard ; Japan , Indonesia , Taiwan , New Zealand , South Africa , and the Australian states of Queensland , Western Australia and Tasmania have a 3 ft 6 in ( 1,067 mm ) gauge , and Malaysia and Thailand have metre-gauge railways . Narrow-gauge trams , particularly metre-gauge , are common in Europe .",

  "/wiki/River_rafting": "Rafting and white water rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water . This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water . Dealing with risk and the need for teamwork is often a part of the experience . This activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s , if not earlier , evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet ( 3.0 m ) to 14 feet ( 4.3 m ) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern , or by the use of oars . Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal , while other sections are not so extreme or difficult . Rafting is also a competitive sport practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting championship event between the participating nations . The International Rafting Federation , often referred to as the IRF , is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport .",

This gauge is also popular in model railroading ( particularly in G scale ) , and model prototypes of these railways have been made by several model train brands around the world , such as Accucraft Trains ( US ) , Aristo-Craft Trains ( US ) , Bachmann Industries ( Hong Kong ) , Delton Locomotive Works ( US ) , LGB ( Germany ) , and PIKO ( Germany ) .",
  "/wiki/D&RGW": "The Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad ( reporting mark DRGW ) , often shortened to Rio Grande , D & RG or D & RGW , formerly the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad , was an American Class I railroad company . The railroad started as a 3 ft ( 914 mm ) narrow-gauge line running south from Denver , Colorado in 1870 . It served mainly as a transcontinental bridge line between Denver , and Salt Lake City , Utah . The Rio Grande was also a major origin of coal and mineral traffic . The Rio Grande was the epitome of mountain railroading , with a motto of Through the Rockies , not around them and later Main line through the Rockies , both referring to the Rocky Mountains . The D & RGW operated the highest mainline rail line in the United States , over the 10,240 feet ( 3,120 m ) Tennessee Pass in Colorado , and the famed routes through the Moffat Tunnel and the Royal Gorge . At its height in the mid-1880s , the D & RG had the largest narrow-gauge railroad network in North America with 2,783 miles ( 4,479 km ) of track interconnecting the states of Colorado , New Mexico , and Utah . Known for its independence , the D & RGW operated the Rio Grande Zephyr until its discontinuation in 1983 . This was the last private intercity passenger train in the United States until Brightline ( now Virgin Trains USA ) began service in Florida in 2018 . In 1988 , the Rio Grande 's parent corporation , Rio Grande Industries , purchased Southern Pacific Transportation Company , and as the result of a merger , the larger Southern Pacific Railroad name was chosen for identity . The Rio Grande operated as a separate division of the Southern Pacific , until that company was acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad . Today , most former D & RGW main lines are owned and operated by the Union Pacific while several branch lines are now operated as heritage railways by various companies .",

The train ran from February 11 , 1937 until January 31 , 1951 as train numbers 115 and 116 , though towards the end of the passenger service it took on the number 215 and 216 . The railroad line was closed by the D & RGW in 1968 and much of the narrow gauge trackage has since been abandoned . A surviving portion of the narrow gauge track in the route is the 64 miles ( 103 km ) long Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad between Antonito and Chama which calls its westbound train the Colorado Limited and its eastbound train the New Mexico Express . The line from Antonito to Alamosa is now standard gauge only and belongs to the San Luis and Rio Grande Railroad . Normally , from Alamosa to Chama , a D & RGW K-36 ( Or K-37 ) class locomotive , either 482 , 483 , 484 , 485 , 488 , or 489 would haul the 4 to 5 car consist . At Chama , the K-36 and their crew would be swapped out with a D & RGW K-28 and their crews would take over from Chama , to Durango . On the return journey it would be the other way around . However , there is photographic evidence of a K-36 locomotive hauling the train the entire length . Normally , the train would be 4 cars long , which consisted of a Railway Post Office Car , or RPO for short , a Baggage Car , a Passenger Car , and a Parlor Car . But there is photographic evidence of the train having as many as 8 cars . According to a 1941 timetable , The Westbound train would depart Alamosa at 7:00 A.M. , arrive at Antonito at 8:05 AM , Chama at 11:15 A.M. , and Arrive at Durango at 4:05 P.M .",

  "/wiki/Wooden_roller_coaster": "A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track . Occasionally , the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss , but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design . The type of wood typically used in the construction of wooden coasters is Southern Yellow Pine , usually grown in the US and the rest of North America . Because of the limits of wood , wooden roller coasters , in general , do not have inversions ( when the coaster goes upside down ) , steep drops , or extremely banked turns ( overbanked turns ) . However , there are exceptions , such as the original loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island ; a corkscrew and 90-degree banked turn at Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells , Wisconsin ; a steel structure at The Voyage at Holiday World ; and banked turns at Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City .",
