  "/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_(historical)": "The Conservative Party of Canada has gone by a variety of names over the years since Canadian Confederation . Initially known as the Liberal-Conservative Party , it dropped Liberal from its name in 1873 , although many of its candidates continued to use this name . As a result of World War I and the Conscription Crisis of 1917 , the party joined with pro-conscription Liberals to become the Unionist Party , led by Robert Borden from 1917 to 1920 , and then the National Liberal and Conservative Party until 1922 . It then reverted to Liberal-Conservative Party until 1938 , when it became simply the National Conservative Party .

  "/wiki/Papal_Army": "The Papal States ( Italian : Stato Pontificio ) , officially the State of the Church ( Italian : Stato della Chiesa , Italian pronunciation : [ \u02c8sta\u02d0to della \u02c8kj\u025b\u02d0za ; \u02c8kje\u02d0- ] ; Latin : Status Ecclesiasticus ; also Dicio Pontificia ) were a series of territories in the Italian Peninsula under the direct sovereign rule of the Pope , from the 8th century until 1870 . They were among the major states of Italy from roughly the 8th century until the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia successfully unified the Italian Peninsula by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870 . At their zenith , the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio ( which includes Rome ) , Marche , Umbria and Romagna , and portions of Emilia . These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the temporal power of the pope , as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy . By 1861 , much of the Papal States ' territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy . Only Lazio , including Rome , remained under the Pope 's temporal control . In 1870 , the Pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all , except the Basilica of St Peter and the papal residence and related buildings around the Vatican quarter of Rome , which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily . In 1929 the head of the Italian government , at the time the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini , ended the crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See by negotiating the Lateran Treaty , signed by the two parties . This recognized the sovereignty of the Holy See over a newly created international territorial entity , the Vatican City State , limited to a token territory .",

The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada 's history , holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result , it is sometimes referred to as Canada 's natural governing party . The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice .
