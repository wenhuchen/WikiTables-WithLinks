  "/wiki/Messianic_Bible_translations": "Messianic Bible translations are translations , or editions of translations , in English of the Christian Bible , some of which are widely used in the Messianic Judaism and Hebrew Roots communities . They are not the same as Jewish English Bible translations , although they are often translated by Jewish Christian scholars . They are often not standard straight English translations of the Christian Bible , but are translations which specifically incorporate Jewish elements for a Jewish audience . These elements include , but are not limited to , the use of the Hebrew names for all books , the Hebrew Bible ( Tanakh ) ordering for the books of the Old Testament , both testaments being named their Hebrew names ( Tanakh and Brit Chadasha ) . This approach also includes the New Testament being translated with the preference of spelling names ( people , concepts and place names ) in transliterated Hebrew rather than directly translated from Greek into English . Some Sacred Name Bibles such as the Hallelujah Scriptures , conform to these elements and are therefore may be considered Messianic Bibles as well .",

  "/wiki/Early_Christianity": "Early Christianity is a period in the history of Christianity , generally reckoned by church historians to begin with the ministry of Jesus ( c. 27-30 ) and end with the First Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) . It is typically divided into two periods : Christianity in the 1st century which is known as the Apostolic Age ( c. 30-100 ) and the Ante-Nicene Period ( c. 100-325 ) . Christians in the Roman Empire were persecuted until Emperor Constantine I 's toleration and promotion of Christianity . The earliest followers of Jesus were an apocalyptic , Second Temple Jewish sect of Jewish Christians in the Roman province of Judea . Throughout the 2nd and 3rd century , Christianity spread to various settlements in around the Mediterranean Basin , Southern Europe , North Africa , Anatolia , and in the east reached the Caspian Sea . A variety of strains developed in , for example , Alexandria , Antioch , Judea , and Rome . One strain , later known as Pauline Christianity , included Gentiles ( non-Jews ) and God-fearers ( non-Jews who partially adopted Hellenistic Judaism ) and departed from Jewish Christianity and Jewish customs ( a decision affirmed in the Council of Jerusalem c. 50 ) . This proto-orthodox Christianity gradually became an independent religion , evolving into the dominant strain of Christianity which condemned other early Christian sects and Jewish Christians as heretics . As proto-orthodox bishops across the Roman and Persian Empires assembled into an organized network , around 180 they began referring to the it as the Great Church . The First Council of Nicaea refined the doctrine of the Great Church , but splinter groups of Gentile Christianity such as Arian Christianity continued to exist as did Jewish Christian groups who continued to follow the Law of Moses . In 380 , the remaining mainstream of Nicene Christianity would become the official religion of the Roman Empire . Early Christians generally used and revered the Hebrew Bible ( the Old Testament ) as a religious text , mostly in the Greek ( Septuagint ) or Aramaic ( Targum ) translations .",

H\u0113 Kain\u1e15 Diath\u1e17k\u0113 ; Latin : Novum Testamentum ) is the second part of the Christian biblical canon , the first being the Old Testament . The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus , as well as events in first-century Christianity . Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture . The New Testament is a collection of Christian texts originally written in the Koine Greek language , at different times by various different authors . While the Old Testament canon varies somewhat between different Christian denominations , the 27-book canon of the New Testament has been almost universally recognized within Christianity since at least Late Antiquity . Thus , in almost all Christian traditions today , the New Testament consists of 27 books : the four canonical gospels ( Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John ) , the Acts of the Apostles , the fourteen epistles of Paul , the seven catholic epistles , and the Book of Revelation . The earliest known complete list of the 27 books of the New Testament is found in a letter written by Athanasius , a 4th-century bishop of Alexandria , dated to 367 AD . The 27-book New Testament was first formally canonized during the councils of Hippo ( 393 ) and Carthage ( 397 ) in North Africa . Pope Innocent I ratified the same canon in 405 , but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under Pope Damasus I gave the same list first . These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament , which included the apocryphal books . There is no scholarly consensus on the date of composition of the latest New Testament texts .",
  "/wiki/Masoretic_Text": "The Masoretic Text [ a ] ( MT or \ud835\udd78 ) is the authoritative Hebrew and Aramaic text of the 24 books of Tanakh for Rabbinic Judaism . It was primarily copied , edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era ( CE ) . The oldest extant manuscripts date from around the 9th century . [ b ] The Aleppo Codex ( once the oldest-known complete copy but since 1947 missing the Torah ) dates from the 10th century . The Masoretic Text defines the Jewish canon and its precise letter-text , with its vocalization and accentuation known as the Masorah . The ancient Hebrew word mesorah ( \u05de\u05e1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 , alt . \u05de\u05e1\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea ) broadly refers to the whole chain of Jewish tradition ( see Oral law ) , which is claimed ( by Orthodox Judaism ) to be unchanged and infallible . Referring to the Masoretic Text , mesorah specifically means the diacritic markings of the text of the Hebrew Scriptures and the concise marginal notes in manuscripts ( and later printings ) of the Tanakh which note textual details , usually about the precise spelling of words . Modern scholars seeking to understand the history of the Tanakhs text use a range of sources other than the Masoretic Text . These include early Greek ( Septuagint ) and Syriac ( Peshitta ) translations , the Samaritan Pentateuch , the Dead Sea Scrolls and quotations from rabbinic manuscripts . Most of these are older than the oldest surviving Masoretic text and often contradict it . Which of the three commonly known versions ( Septuagint , Masoretic Text , Samaritan Pentateuch ) is closest to the alleged ( but unsubstantiated ) Urtext is not determinable .",

  "/wiki/Old_Testament": "The Old Testament ( abbreviated OT ) is the first part of the Christian biblical canon , which is based primarily upon the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible ( or Tanakh ) , a collection of ancient religious Hebrew writings by the Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God . The second part of Christian Bibles is the New Testament , originally written in the Koine Greek language . The books that comprise the Old Testament canon , as well as their order and names , differ between Christian denominations . The Catholic canon comprises 46 books , the canons of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches comprise up to 49 books , and the most common Protestant canon comprises 39 books . The 39 books in common to all the Christian canons correspond to the 24 books of the Tanakh , with some differences of order , and there are some differences in text . The additional number reflects the splitting of several texts ( Kings , Samuel and Chronicles , Ezra-Nehemiah and the Twelve Minor Prophets ) into separate books in Christian bibles . The books that are part of the Christian Old Testament but that are not part of the Hebrew canon are sometimes described as deuterocanonical . In general , Protestant Bibles do not include the deuterocanonical books in their canon , but some versions of Anglican and Lutheran bibles place such books in a separate section called Apocrypha . These extra books are ultimately derived from the earlier Greek Septuagint collection of the Hebrew scriptures and are also Jewish in origin . Some are also contained in the Dead Sea Scrolls . The Old Testament consists of many distinct books by various authors produced over a period of centuries . Christians traditionally divide the Old Testament into four sections : ( 1 ) the first five books or Pentateuch ( Torah ) ; ( 2 ) the history books telling the history of the Israelites , from their conquest of Canaan to their defeat and exile in Babylon ; ( 3 ) the poetic and Wisdom books dealing , in various forms , with questions of good and evil in the world ; and ( 4 ) the books of the biblical prophets , warning of the consequences of turning away from God .",

  "/wiki/Septuagint": "The Greek Old Testament , or Septuagint ( from the Latin : septu\u0101gint\u0101 , lit . 'seventy ' ; often abbreviated 70 ; in Roman numerals , LXX ) , is the earliest extant Koine Greek translation of books from the Hebrew Bible , various biblical apocrypha , and deuterocanonical books . The first five books of the Hebrew Bible , known as the Torah or the Pentateuch , were translated in the mid-3rd century BCE ; they did not survive as original translation texts , however , except as rare fragments . The remaining books of the Greek Old Testament are presumably translations from 200 BCE to 50 CE .

'The Translation of the Seventy ' ) derives from the story recorded in the Letter of Aristeas that the Hebrew Torah was translated into Greek at the request of Ptolemy II Philadelphus ( 285-247 BCE ) by 70 Jewish scholars or , according to later tradition , 72 : six scholars from each of the Twelve Tribes of Israel , who independently produced identical translations . The miraculous character of the Aristeas legend might indicate the esteem and disdain in which the translation was held at the time ; Greek translations of Hebrew scriptures were in circulation among the Alexandrian Jews . Egyptian papyri from the period have led most scholars to view as probable Aristeas ' dating of the translation of the Pentateuch to the third century BCE . Whatever share the Ptolemaic court may have had in the translation , it satisfied a need felt by the Jewish community ( in whom the knowledge of Hebrew was waning among the demands of every-day life ) . Greek scriptures were in wide use by the time of Jesus and Paul of Tarsus ( early Christianity ) because most Christian proselytes , God-fearers , and other gentile sympathizers of Hellenistic Judaism could not read Hebrew . The text of the Greek Old Testament is quoted more often than the original Hebrew Bible text in the Greek New Testament ( particularly the Pauline epistles ) by the Apostolic Fathers , and later by the Greek Church Fathers .

It was discovered near Nag Hammadi , Egypt , in December 1945 among a group of books known as the Nag Hammadi library . Scholars speculate that the works were buried in response to a letter from Bishop Athanasius declaring a strict canon of Christian scripture . Scholars have proposed dates of composition as early as 60 AD and as late as 140 AD . The Coptic-language text , the second of seven contained in what modern-day scholars have designated as Codex II , is composed of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus . Almost half of these sayings resemble those found in the canonical gospels , while it is speculated that the other sayings were added from Gnostic tradition . Its place of origin may have been Syria , where Thomasine traditions were strong . The introduction states : These are the hidden words that the living Jesus spoke and Didymos Judas Thomas wrote them down . Didymus ( Greek ) and Thomas ( Aramaic ) both mean twin . The text 's authorship by Thomas the Apostle is rejected by modern scholars . It is possible that the document originated within a school of early Christians , possibly proto-Gnostics .

Jesus discusses marriage only in a heterosexual context when he cites the Book of Genesis during a discussion of marriage ( Matthew 19:4-6 and Mark 10:6-9 ) . The references to homosexuality itself in the New Testament hinge on the interpretation of three specific Greek words : arsenokoit\u0113s ( \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ) , malakos ( \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ) , and porneia ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 ) and its cognates .

It resulted in the development of non-denominational Christian churches , which stressed reliance on scripture and few essentials . :111 Campbell was influenced by similar efforts in Scotland , in particular , by James and Robert Haldane , who emphasized their interpretation of Christianity as found in the New Testament . In 1832 , the group of reformers led by the Campbells merged with a similar movement that began under the leadership of Barton W. Stone in Kentucky . :112 Their congregations identified as Disciples of Christ or Christian churches . Several church groups have some historical ties with Campbell 's efforts . The three main groups are the Churches of Christ , the Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) , and the independent Christian churches and churches of Christ .

  "/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library": "The Nag Hammadi library ( also known as the Chenoboskion Manuscripts and the Gnostic Gospels [ a ] ) is a collection of early Christian and Gnostic texts discovered near the Upper Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi in 1945 . Thirteen leather-bound papyrus codices buried in a sealed jar were found by a local farmer named Muhammed al-Samman . The writings in these codices comprise 52 mostly Gnostic treatises , but they also include three works belonging to the Corpus Hermeticum and a partial translation/alteration of Plato 's Republic . In his introduction to The Nag Hammadi Library in English , James Robinson suggests that these codices may have belonged to a nearby Pachomian monastery and were buried after Saint Athanasius condemned the use of non-canonical books in his Festal Letter of 367 A.D . The discovery of these texts significantly influenced modern scholarship 's pursuit and knowledge of early Christianity and Gnosticism . The contents of the codices were written in the Coptic language . The best-known of these works is probably the Gospel of Thomas , of which the Nag Hammadi codices contain the only complete text . After the discovery , scholars recognized that fragments of these sayings attributed to Jesus appeared in manuscripts discovered at Oxyrhynchus in 1898 ( P. Oxy . 1 ) , and matching quotations were recognized in other early Christian sources . The written text of the Gospel of Thomas is dated to the second century by most interpreters , but based on much earlier sources . The buried manuscripts date from the 3rd and 4th centuries . The Nag Hammadi codices are currently housed in the Coptic Museum in Cairo , Egypt .",

  "/wiki/Wescott-Hort": "The New Testament in the Original Greek is a Greek-language version of the New Testament published in 1881 . It is also known as the Westcott and Hort text , after its editors Brooke Foss Westcott ( 1825-1901 ) and Fenton John Anthony Hort ( 1828-1892 ) . ( Textual scholars use the abbreviation WH . ) It is a critical text , compiled from some of the oldest New Testament fragments and texts that had been discovered at the time . The two editors worked together for 28 years . Westcott and Hort state : [ It is ] our belief that even among the numerous unquestionably spurious readings of the New Testament there are no signs of deliberate falsification of the text for dogmatic purposes . They find that without orthographic differences , doubtful textual variants exist only in one sixtieth of the whole New Testament ( with most of them being comparatively trivial variations ) , with the substantial variations forming hardly more than one thousandth of the entire text . According to Hort , Knowledge of Documents should precede Final Judgments upon Readings . The two editors favoured two manuscripts : Vaticanus and Sinaiticus . They also believed that the combination of Codex Bezae with the Old Latin and the Old Syriac represents the original form of the New Testament text , especially when it is shorter than other forms of the text , such as the majority of the Byzantine text-type . In this they followed one of the primary principles of their fledgling textual criticism , lectio brevior , sometimes taken to an extreme , as in the theory of Western non-interpolations , which has since been rejected .",
