  "/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board": "The Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) is an American self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings to consumer video games . The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association ( ESA , formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association ( IDSA ) ) , in response to criticism of controversial video games with excessively violent or sexual content , particularly after the 1993 congressional hearings following the releases of Mortal Kombat and Night Trap for home consoles . The industry , pressured with potential government oversight of video game ratings from these hearings , established both the IDSA and the ESRB within it to create a voluntary ratings system based on the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system with additional considerations for video game interactivity . The board assigns ratings to games based on their content , using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries , using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game 's content and suitability , along with a system of content descriptors which detail specific types of content present in a particular game . More recently , the ratings also include descriptors for games with online interactivity or in-game monetization . The ratings are determined by a combination of material provided by the game 's publisher in both questionnaires and video footage of the game , and a review of this material by a panel of reviewers who assign it a rating . The ratings are designed towards parents so they can make informed decisions about purchasing games for their children . Once a game is rated , the ESRB maintains a code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games - ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences . The ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American video game and retail industries for physical releases ; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB 's highest age ratings , and do not stock games which have not been rated . Additionally , major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings , while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse to stock games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only . More recently , the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and mobile apps , which utilizes a survey answered by the product 's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff , allowing online storefronts to filter and restrict titles based on the ESRB . Through the International Age Rating Coalition ( IARC ) , this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories .",
