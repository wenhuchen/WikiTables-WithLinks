  "/wiki/Capital_(political)": "A capital or capital city is the municipality exercising primary status in a country , state , province , or other administrative region , usually as its seat of government . A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government 's offices and meeting places ; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution . In some jurisdictions , including several countries , the different branches of government are located in different settlements . In some cases , a distinction is made between the official ( constitutional ) capital and the seat of government , which is in another place . Capital cities that also serve as the prime economic , population , cultural , or intellectual centres of a nation or an empire are sometimes referred to as primate cities . Examples are Athens , Bangkok , Brussels , Copenhagen , Cairo , London , Mexico City , Paris , Lima , Seoul and Tokyo . News media often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there , as a form of metonymy . For example , relations between Washington and London refer to relations between the United States and the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Census": "A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population . This term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses ; other common censuses include traditional culture , business , supplies , agricultural , and traffic censuses . The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as individual enumeration , universality within a defined territory , simultaneity and defined periodicity , and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every ten years . United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected , official definitions , classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practices . The word is of Latin origin : during the Roman Republic , the census was a list that kept track of all adult males fit for military service . The modern census is essential to international comparisons of any kind of statistics , and censuses collect data on many attributes of a population , not just how many people there are . Censuses typically began as the only method of collecting national demographic data , and are now part of a larger system of different surveys . Although population estimates remain an important function of a census , including exactly the geographic distribution of the population , statistics can be produced about combinations of attributes e.g . education by age and sex in different regions . Current administrative data systems allow for other approaches to enumeration with the same level of detail but raise concerns about privacy and the possibility of biasing estimates . A census can be contrasted with sampling in which information is obtained only from a subset of a population ; typically main population estimates are updated by such intercensal estimates . Modern census data are commonly used for research , business marketing , and planning , and as a baseline for designing sample surveys by providing a sampling frame such as an address register .",

The archipelago , which is of volcanic origin , is 1,750 kilometres ( 1,090 mi ) east of northern Australia , 540 kilometres ( 340 mi ) northeast of New Caledonia , east of New Guinea , southeast of the Solomon Islands , and west of Fiji . Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people . The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s , who arrived on the largest island , Esp\u00edritu Santo , in 1606 . Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 ( following the vacancy of the Portuguese throne , which lasted for sixty years , until 1640 , when the Portuguese monarchy was restored ) , Queir\u00f3s claimed the archipelago for Spain , as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies , and named it La Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo . In the 1880s , France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago , and in 1906 , they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through an Anglo-French condominium . An independence movement arose in the 1970s , and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980 . Since independence , the country has become a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations , Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the Pacific Islands Forum ."
