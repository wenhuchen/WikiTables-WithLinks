In 1876 the Bairnsdale Shire , which went on to become one of the largest in Victoria in the 1880s , was led out of administrative chaos by former shire auditor and shipping agent Herman Bredt . He had also acted as a mine manager for the nearby Sons of Freedom mine . German born Bredt was the father of Bertha Bredt who married the famous Australia poet and writer Henry Lawson .

In terms of population Ballarat is the third largest inland city in Australia . Just months after Victoria was granted separation from the state of New South Wales , the Victorian gold rush transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement . Gold was discovered on 18 August 1851 , and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted . Unlike many other gold boom towns , the Ballarat fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades , which can be evidenced to this day in the city 's rich architecture . The city is famous for the 1854 tax-revolt known as the Eureka Rebellion . In response to this event the first male suffrage in Australia was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of democracy in Australia . The rebellion 's symbol , the Eureka Flag , has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat . Proclaimed a city in 1871 , its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century , after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and Geelong rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction . It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the 1956 Summer Olympics .
