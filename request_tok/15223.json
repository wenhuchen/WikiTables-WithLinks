  "/wiki/MG_08": "The Maschinengewehr 08 , or MG 08 , was the German Army 's standard machine gun in World War I and is an adaptation of Hiram S. Maxim 's original 1884 Maxim gun . It was produced in a number of variants during the war . The MG 08 served during World War II as a heavy machine gun in many German infantry divisions , although by the end of the war it had mostly been relegated to second-rate fortress units . The Maschinengewehr 08 ( or MG 08 ) - so-named after 1908 , its year of adoption - was a development of the license made Maschinengewehr 01 . The firing rate depends on the lock assembly used and averages 500 rounds per minute for the Schloss 08 and 600 rounds per minute for the Schloss 16 . The gun used 250-round fabric belts of 7.92\u00d757mm ammunition . It was water-cooled , using a jacket around the barrel that held approximately 3.7 litres ( 0.98 US gal ) of water . Using a separate attachment sight with range calculator for indirect fire , the MG 08 could be operated from cover . Additional telescopic sights were also developed and used in quantity during the war . The MG 08 , like the Maxim gun , operated on the basis of short barrel recoil and a toggle lock . Once cocked and fired the MG 08 would continue firing rounds until the trigger was released or until all available ammunition was expended . Its practical range was estimated at some 2,000 metres ( 2,200 yd ) up to an extreme range of 3,600 metres ( 3,900 yd ) .",
  "/wiki/Deutsche_Waffen_und_Munitionsfabriken": "Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken Aktiengesellschaft ( German Weapons and Munitions public limited company ) , known as DWM , was an arms company in Imperial Germany created in 1896 when Ludwig Loewe & Company united its weapons and ammunition production facilities within one company . In 1896 Loewe founded Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken with a munitions plant in Karlsruhe ( Baden ) , formerly Deutsche Metallpatronenfabrik Lorenz , and the weapons plant in Berlin . Shares that Loewe had in other gun- and ammunition plants were transferred to DWM . This included Waffenfabrik Mauser , Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre ( FN ) in Belgium and Waffen- und Munitionsfabrik A.G. in Budapest . The DWM was orchestrated by Isidor Loewe ( 1848-1910 ) , as his brother Ludwig had died in 1886 . Karl Maybach ( who was part of the Maybach company ) was employed by the Loewe company in 1901 .",

The 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser cartridge was adopted by the German Empire in 1903-1905 , and was the German service cartridge in both World Wars . In its day , the 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser cartridge was one of the world 's most popular military cartridges . In the 21st century it is still a popular sport and hunting cartridge that is factory-produced in Europe and the United States .",
  "/wiki/Wehrmacht": "The Wehrmacht ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8ve\u02d0\u0250\u032fmaxt ] ( listen ) , lit . defence force ) was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945 . It consisted of the Heer ( army ) , the Kriegsmarine ( navy ) and the Luftwaffe ( air force ) . The designation Wehrmacht replaced the previously used term Reichswehr , and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime 's efforts to rearm Germany to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted . After the Nazi rise to power in 1933 , one of Adolf Hitler 's most overt and audacious moves was to establish the Wehrmacht , a modern offensively-capable armed force , fulfilling the Nazi regime 's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours . This required the reinstatement of conscription , and massive investment and defense spending on the arms industry . The Wehrmacht formed the heart of Germany 's politico-military power . In the early part of the Second World War , the Wehrmacht employed combined arms tactics ( close cover air-support , tanks , and infantry ) to devastating effect in what became known as Blitzkrieg ( lightning war ) . Its campaigns in France ( 1940 ) , the Soviet Union ( 1941 ) , and North Africa ( 1941/42 ) are regarded as acts of boldness . At the same time , the far-flung advances strained the Wehrmacht 's capacity to the breaking point , culminating in the first major defeat in the Battle of Moscow ( 1941 ) ; by late 1942 , Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres . The operational art was no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition , making the Wehrmacht 's weaknesses in strategy , doctrine , and logistics readily apparent . Closely cooperating with the SS and the Einsatzgruppen , the German armed forces committed numerous war crimes , despite later denials and promotion of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht .",

  "/wiki/Luftwaffe": "The Luftwaffe [ N 2 ] ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8l\u028aftvaf\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) was the aerial warfare branch of the Wehrmacht during World War II . Germany 's military air arms during World War I , the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte of the Imperial Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of theImperial Navy had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force . During the interwar period , German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in Soviet Union . With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty , the Luftwaffe 's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935 , just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German re-armament and conscription would be announced on 16 March . The Condor Legion , a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War , provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft . Partially as a result of this combat experience , the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated , technologically advanced , and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in 1939 . By the summer of 1939 , the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader ( wings ) . The Luftwaffe also operated Fallschirmj\u00e4ger paratrooper units . The Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940 . During the Battle of Britain , however , despite inflicting severe damage to the RAF 's infrastructure and , during the subsequent Blitz , devastating many British cities , the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission . From 1942 , Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe 's fighter arm . From late 1942 , the Luftwaffe used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise Luftwaffe Field Divisions .",
  "/wiki/MG_30": "The Maschinengewehr 30 , or MG 30 was a German-designed machine gun that saw some service with various armed forces in the 1930s . It was also modified to become the standard German aircraft gun as the MG 15 and MG 17 . It is most notable as the design pattern that led to the MG 34 and MG 42 , and thus is one of the major ancestors of many of the weapons in service which would later find widespread use into the 21st century .",

  "/wiki/Waffen-SS": "The Waffen-SS ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8vafn\u0329\u0294\u025bs\u02cc\u0294\u025bs ] ) was the military branch of the Nazi Party 's SS organisation . Its formations included men from Nazi Germany , along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and unoccupied lands . The Waffen-SS grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II , and served alongside the Heer ( regular army ) , Ordnungspolizei ( uniformed police ) and other security units . Originally , it was under the control of the SS F\u00fchrungshauptamt ( SS operational command office ) beneath Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler . With the start of World War II , tactical control was exercised by the High Command of the Armed Forces ( OKW ) , with some units being subordinated to Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS ( Command Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS ) directly under Himmler 's control . Initially , in keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany , membership was open only to people of Germanic origin ( so-called Aryan ancestry ) . The rules were partially relaxed in 1940 , and later the formation of units composed largely or solely of foreign volunteers and conscripts was authorised . These SS units were made up of men mainly from among the nationals of Nazi-occupied Europe . Despite relaxation of the rules , the Waffen-SS was still based on the racist ideology of Nazism , and ethnic Poles ( who were viewed as subhumans ) were specifically barred from the formations . Members of the Waffen-SS were involved in numerous atrocities . At the post-war Nuremberg trials , the Waffen-SS was judged to be a criminal organisation due to its connection to the Nazi Party and direct involvement in numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity . Former Waffen-SS members , with the exception of conscripts , who comprised about one third of the membership , were denied many of the rights afforded to military veterans .",
  "/wiki/MG_34": "The Maschinengewehr 34 , or MG 34 , is a German recoil-operated air-cooled machine gun , first tested in 1929 , introduced in 1934 , and issued to units in 1936 . It introduced an entirely new concept in automatic firepower - the Einheitsmaschinengewehr ( Universal machine gun ) - and is generally considered the world 's first general-purpose machine gun ( GPMG ) . The versatile MG 34 was chambered for the full-power 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser rifle cartridge , and was arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time of its deployment . The MG 34 was envisaged and well developed to provide portable light and medium machine gun infantry cover , anti-aircraft coverage , and even sniping ability . Its combination of exceptional mobility - being light enough to be carried by one man - and high rate of fire ( of up to 900 rounds per minute ) was unmatched . It entered service in great numbers from 1939 . Nonetheless , the design proved to be rather complex for mass production , and was supplemented by the cheaper and simpler to mass produce MG 42 , though both remained in service and production until the end of the war .",
  "/wiki/Mauser": "Mauser , originally K\u00f6nigliche Waffen Schmieden , is a German arms manufacturer .

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Mauser designs were also exported and licensed to many countries which adopted them as military and civilian sporting firearms . The Mauser Model 98 in particular was widely adopted and copied , and is the foundation of many of today 's sporting bolt action rifles .",
  "/wiki/Kriegsmarine": "The Kriegsmarine ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8k\u0281i\u02d0ksma\u02cc\u0281i\u02d0n\u0259 ] , lit . War Navy ) was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945 . It superseded the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) and the inter-war Reichsmarine ( 1919-1935 ) of the Weimar Republic . The Kriegsmarine was one of three official branches , along with the Heer and the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht , the German armed forces from 1933 to 1945 . In violation of the Treaty of Versailles , the Kriegsmarine grew rapidly during German naval rearmament in the 1930s . The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of submarines . Kriegsmarine ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the Spanish Civil War ( 1936-1939 ) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention , but in reality supported the Nationalists against the Spanish Republicans . In January 1939 , Plan Z was ordered , calling for surface naval parity with the British Royal Navy by 1944 . When World War II broke out in September 1939 , Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building program for submarines ( U-boats ) instead of capital surface warships and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources . The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine ( as for all branches of armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power ) was Adolf Hitler , who exercised his authority through the Oberkommando der Marine . The Kriegsmarine 's most significant ships were the U-boats , most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II . Wolfpacks were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic but this tactic was largely abandoned by May 1943 when U-boat losses mounted .",
  "/wiki/MG_42": "The MG 42 ( shortened from German : Maschinengewehr 42 , or machine gun 42 ) is a 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser general-purpose machine gun designed in Nazi Germany and used extensively by the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS during the second half of World War II . It was intended to replace the earlier MG 34 , which was more expensive and took much longer to produce , but both weapons were produced until the end of World War II . Designed to be low-cost and easy to build , the MG 42 proved to be highly reliable and easy to operate . It is most notable for its very high cyclic rate for a gun using full power service cartridges , averaging about 1,200 rounds per minute compared to around 850 for the MG 34 , and perhaps 450 to 600 for other common machine guns like the M1919 Browning or Bren . This ability made it extremely effective in providing suppressive fire , and its unique sound led to it being nicknamed Hitler 's buzzsaw . The MG 42 was adopted by several armed organizations after the war , and was both copied and built under licence . The MG 42 's lineage continued past Nazi Germany 's defeat , forming the basis for the nearly identical MG1 ( MG 42/59 ) , chambered in 7.62\u00d751mm NATO , which subsequently evolved into the MG1A3 , and later the Bundeswehr 's MG 3 and Italian MG 42/59 . It also spawned the Yugoslav nearly identical Zastava M53 , Swiss MG 51 and SIG MG 710-3 , Austrian MG 74 , and the Spanish 5.56\u00d745mm NATO Ameli light machine gun , and lent many design elements to the American M60 and Belgian MAG .",

  "/wiki/MG_81": "The MG 81 was a German belt fed 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser machine gun which was used in flexible installations in World War II Luftwaffe aircraft , in which capacity it replaced the older drum magazine-fed MG 15 . The MG 81 was developed by Mauser as a derivative of their successful MG 34 general-purpose machine gun . Development focus was to reduce production cost and time and to optimize the machine gun for use in aircraft . Developed in 1938/1939 , it was in production from 1940 to 1945 . A special twin-mount MG 81Z ( the Z suffix stands for Zwilling , meaning twin ) was introduced in 1942 . It paired up two of the weapons on one mount to provide even more firepower with a maximum cyclic rate of fire of 3,200 rounds per minute without requiring much more space than a standard machine gun . Towards the end of the war many specimens were delivered to the army and equipped for use in ground battles with shoulder rest and bipod ."
