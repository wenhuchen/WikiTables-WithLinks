  "/wiki/Bulk_freighter": "A bulk carrier , bulker is a merchant ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo , such as grains , coal , ore , steel coils and cement , in its cargo holds . Since the first specialized bulk carrier was built in 1852 , economic forces have led to continued development of these ships , resulting in increased size and sophistication . Today 's bulk carriers are specially designed to maximize capacity , safety , efficiency , and durability . Today , bulk carriers make up 21% of the world 's merchant fleets and range in size from single-hold mini-bulk carriers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400,000 metric tons of deadweight ( DWT ) . A number of specialized designs exist : some can unload their own cargo , some depend on port facilities for unloading , and some even package the cargo as it is loaded . Over half of all bulk carriers have Greek , Japanese , or Chinese owners and more than a quarter are registered in Panama . South Korea is the largest single builder of bulk carriers , and 82% of these ships were built in Asia . On bulk carriers , crew are involved in operation management and maintenance of the vessel taking care of safety , navigation , maintenance and cargo care , in accordance with international maritime legislation . Cargo loading operations vary in complexity and loading and discharging of cargo can take several days . Bulk carriers can be gearless ( dependent upon terminal equipment ) or geared ( having cranes integral to the vessel ) . Crews can range in size from three people on the smallest ships to over 30 on the largest . Bulk cargo can be very dense , corrosive , or abrasive .",
  "/wiki/Consort_(nautical)": "Consort is a nautical term for unpowered Great Lakes vessels , usually a fully loaded schooner barge or steamer barge , towed by a larger steamer that would often tow more than one barge . The consort system was used in the Great Lakes from the 1860s to around 1920 . Mariner and historian Mark Thompson wrote that the unpowered barges were uninspected vessels not regulated by the marine safety laws . He reported that between 1870 and 1940 , the dangerous practice of towing unpowered vessels resulted in many of the most serious groundings when they broke loose or were cut loose during storms . Consort is also used as the term for any ship sailing alongside another , particularly as an escort or ship 's tender . Pirates who sailed in small fleets were often described as sailing in consort to one another , that is , one ship following or escorting another to whom it was allied ; for example ; Thomas Howard 's Prosperous and John Bowen 's Speedy Return :",
  "/wiki/Iron_ore": "Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted . The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey , bright yellow , or deep purple to rusty red . The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite ( Fe3O4 , 72.4% Fe ) , hematite ( Fe2O3 , 69.9% Fe ) , goethite ( FeO ( OH ) , 62.9% Fe ) , limonite ( FeO ( OH ) \u00b7n ( H2O ) , 55% Fe ) or siderite ( FeCO3 , 48.2% Fe ) . Ores containing very high quantities of hematite or magnetite ( greater than about 60% iron ) are known as natural ore or direct shipping ore , meaning they can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces . Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron , which is one of the main raw materials to make steel - 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel . Indeed , it has been argued that iron ore is more integral to the global economy than any other commodity , except perhaps oil .",

It is a northern town on the North Shore with a population of 1,351 at the 2010 census . It is also the county seat and sole municipality of Cook County . Prior to inhabitation by French Canadian settlers and prior to Minnesota 's statehood , Grand Marais was inhabited by the Anishinaabe indigenous people , the thriving woodland people also known as the Ojibwe . The Ojibwe name for the area is Gichi-biitoobiig , which means great duplicate water , parallel body of water or double body of water ( like a bayou ) , a reference to the two bays which form the large harbor of Lake Superior . The area was a bustling fur trading station since the 1700s , and the French Canadian Voyageurs termed the settled village Grand Marais which is French for Great Marsh , referring to a marsh that , in early fur-trading times , was 20 acres ( 8.1 ha ) or less in area , nearly at the level of Lake Superior , and situated at the head of the little bay and harbor that led to the settlement of the village there . Another small bay on the east , less protected from storms , is separated from the harbor by a slight projecting point and a short beach . Also , Grand Marais also may mean sheltered water area , as the harbor has natural breakwall rock outcroppings , providing for a natural safe harbor for early Lake Superior explorers . Located on the east side of Grand Marais is Chippewa City . Chippewa City thrived in the 1890s , with about 100 families living in the village . The historic Francis Xavier church still stands slightly north of town , just off Highway 61 . The church began as a Jesuit mission from Fort William , Ontario in 1855 to minister to the Ojibwe residents of the area .",

In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament .

A path where items are regularly carried between bodies of water is also called a portage . Early French explorers in New France and French Louisiana encountered many rapids and cascades . The Native Americans carried their canoes over land to avoid river obstacles . Over time , important portages were sometimes provided with canals with locks , and even portage railways . Primitive portaging generally involves carrying the vessel and its contents across the portage in multiple trips . Small canoes can be portaged by carrying them inverted over one 's shoulders and the center strut may be designed in the style of a yoke to facilitate this . Historically , voyageurs often employed tump lines on their heads to carry loads on their backs . Portages can be many kilometers in length , such as the 19-kilometre ( 12 mi ) Methye Portage and the 8.5-mile ( 13.7 km ) Grand Portage ( both in North America ) often covering hilly or difficult terrain . Some portages involve very little elevation change , such as the very short Mavis Grind in Shetland , which crosses an isthmus .",

Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States of various regions traded among themselves in the pre-Columbian Era . Europeans participated in the trade from the time of their arrival in the New World , extending the trade 's reach to Europe . The French started trading in the 16th century , the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada during the 17th century , while the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland . North American fur trade was at its peak of economic importance in the 19th century , and involved the development of elaborate trade networks . The fur trade became one of the main economic ventures in North America attracting competition among the French , British , Dutch , Spanish , and Russians . Indeed , in the early history of the United States , capitalizing on this trade , and removing the British stranglehold over it , was seen as a major economic objective . Many Native American societies across the continent came to depend on the fur trade as their primary source of income . By the mid-1800s changing fashions in Europe brought about a collapse in fur prices . The American Fur Company and some other companies failed .

The documented westward migration over time has been strongly associated with their roles as traders and hunters in the North American fur trade .",
  "/wiki/Schroeder_Lumber_Company_Bunkhouse": "The Schroeder Lumber Company Bunkhouse is the last remaining structure of a logging camp in Schroeder , Minnesota , United States , on the North Shore of Lake Superior . The Schroeder Lumber Company from Milwaukee , Wisconsin , established a camp there in 1895 , on the Cross River . The loggers had plenty of white pine , balsam fir , and spruce trees to cut . Loggers also dynamited the top 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) of the Cross River waterfall to widen the river and built a series of dams to hold water in reserve . This enabled the loggers to move the logs down the river and into Lake Superior , where they were collected into a holding boom that kept the logs from floating away . The camp operated until 1905 , when crews left to log the Apostle Islands . The camp had a reputation for good living conditions , fair wages , and good food . Lumberjacks ate a lot , and if the food was n't to their liking , they would leave and seek employment with a different company . The sleeping accommodations were spartan , with rows of wooden bunk beds topped with mattresses stuffed with straw , hay , or evergreen boughs , along with pillows stuffed with grain and straw . Author Cathy Wurzer speculates that the smell in the bunkhouse was rather ripe , given the smell of wet woolen clothes being hung up to dry and the housing of sweaty workers living in close quarters . For a time , the Schroeder Lumber Company was one of the largest lumber retailers in the United States . The company owned and operated every step in the lumber supply chain , from cutting down trees to shipping the logs to milling and manufacturing wood products .",

  "/wiki/Commercial_fishing": "Commercial fishing is the activity of catching fish and other seafood for commercial profit , mostly from wild fisheries . It provides a large quantity of food to many countries around the earth , but those who practice it as an industry must often pursue fish far into the ocean under adverse conditions . Large-scale commercial fishing is also known as industrial fishing . This profession has gained in popularity with the development of shows such as Deadliest Catch , Swords , and Wicked Tuna . The major fishing industries are not only owned by major corporations but by small families as well . The industry has had to adapt through the years in order to keep earning a profit . A study taken on some small family-owned commercial fishing companies showed that they adapted to continue to earn a living but not necessarily make a large profit . It is the adaptability of the fishermen and their methods that cause some concern for fishery managers and researchers ; they say that for those reasons , the sustainability of the marine ecosystems could be in danger of being ruined . Commercial fishermen harvest a wide variety of animals , ranging from tuna , cod , carp , and salmon to shrimp , krill , lobster , clams , squid , and crab , in various fisheries for these species . There are large and important fisheries worldwide for various species of fish , mollusks , crustaceans , and echinoderms . However , a very small number of species support the majority of the world 's fisheries of these species are herring , cod , anchovy , tuna , flounder , mullet , squid , shrimp , salmon , crab , lobster , oyster and scallops . All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a million tonnes in 1999 , with herring and sardines together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999 ."
