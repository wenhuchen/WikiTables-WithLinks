  "/wiki/Crystal_system": "In crystallography , the terms crystal system , crystal family , and lattice system each refer to one of several classes of space groups , lattices , point groups , or crystals . Informally , two crystals are in the same crystal system if they have similar symmetries , although there are many exceptions to this . Crystal systems , crystal families and lattice systems are similar but slightly different , and there is widespread confusion between them : in particular the trigonal crystal system is often confused with the rhombohedral lattice system , and the term crystal system is sometimes used to mean lattice system or crystal family . Space groups and crystals are divided into seven crystal systems according to their point groups , and into seven lattice systems according to their Bravais lattices . Five of the crystal systems are essentially the same as five of the lattice systems , but the hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems differ from the hexagonal and rhombohedral lattice systems . The six crystal families are formed by combining the hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems into one hexagonal family , in order to eliminate this confusion .",

  "/wiki/Birefringence": "Birefringence is the optical property of a material having a refractive index that depends on the polarization and propagation direction of light . These optically anisotropic materials are said to be birefringent ( or birefractive ) . The birefringence is often quantified as the maximum difference between refractive indices exhibited by the material . Crystals with non-cubic crystal structures are often birefringent , as are plastics under mechanical stress . Birefringence is responsible for the phenomenon of double refraction whereby a ray of light , when incident upon a birefringent material , is split by polarization into two rays taking slightly different paths . This effect was first described by the Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin in 1669 , who observed it in calcite , a crystal having one of the strongest birefringences . However it was not until the 19th century that Augustin-Jean Fresnel described the phenomenon in terms of polarization , understanding light as a wave with field components in transverse polarizations ( perpendicular to the direction of the wave vector ) .",

  "/wiki/Biotite": "Biotite is a common group of phyllosilicate minerals within the mica group , with the approximate chemical formula K ( Mg , Fe ) 3AlSi3O10 ( F , OH ) 2 . It is primarily a solid-solution series between the iron-endmember annite , and the magnesium-endmember phlogopite ; more aluminous end-members include siderophyllite and eastonite . Biotite was regarded as a mineral species by the International Mineralogical Association until 1998 , when its status was changed to a mineral group . The term biotite is still used to describe unanalysed dark micas in the field . Biotite was named by J.F.L . Hausmann in 1847 in honor of the French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot , who performed early research into the many optical properties of mica . Members of the biotite group are sheet silicates . Iron , magnesium , aluminium , silicon , oxygen , and hydrogen form sheets that are weakly bound together by potassium ions . It is sometimes called iron mica because it is more iron-rich than phlogopite . It is also sometimes called black mica as opposed to white mica ( muscovite ) - both form in the same rocks , and in some instances side-by-side .",

  "/wiki/Chlorite_group": "The chlorites are a group of phyllosilicate minerals . Chlorites can be described by the following four endmembers based on their chemistry via substitution of the following four elements in the silicate lattice ; Mg , Fe , Ni , and Mn . In addition , zinc , lithium , and calcium species are known . The great range in composition results in considerable variation in physical , optical , and X-ray properties . Similarly , the range of chemical composition allows chlorite group minerals to exist over a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions . For this reason chlorite minerals are ubiquitous minerals within low and medium temperature metamorphic rocks , some igneous rocks , hydrothermal rocks and deeply buried sediments . The name chlorite is from the Greek chloros ( \u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 ) , meaning green , in reference to its color . They do not contain the element chlorine , also named from the same Greek root .",

It is the most common source ore for refining elemental mercury , and is the historic source for the brilliant red or scarlet pigment termed vermilion and associated red mercury pigments . Cinnabar generally occurs as a vein-filling mineral associated with recent volcanic activity and alkaline hot springs . The mineral resembles quartz in symmetry and in its exhibiting birefringence . Cinnabar has a mean refractive index near 3.2 , a hardness between 2.0 and 2.5 , and a specific gravity of approximately 8.1 . The color and properties derive from a structure that is a hexagonal crystalline lattice belonging to the trigonal crystal system , crystals that sometimes exhibit twinning . Cinnabar has been used for its color since antiquity in the Near East , including as a rouge-type cosmetic , in the New World since the Olmec culture , and in China since as early as the Yangshao culture , where it was used in coloring stoneware . Associated modern precautions for use and handling of cinnabar arise from the toxicity of the mercury component , which was recognized as early as ancient Rome .",
  "/wiki/Corundum": "Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide ( Al2O3 ) typically containing traces of iron , titanium , vanadium and chromium . It is a rock-forming mineral . It is also a naturally transparent material , but can have different colors depending on the presence of transition metal impurities in its crystalline structure . Corundum has two primary gem varieties : ruby and sapphire . Rubies are red due to the presence of chromium , and sapphires exhibit a range of colors depending on what transition metal is present . A rare type of sapphire , padparadscha sapphire , is pink-orange . The name corundum is derived from the Tamil-Dravidian word kurundam ( ruby-sapphire ) ( appearing in Sanskrit as kuruvinda ) . Because of corundum 's hardness ( pure corundum is defined to have 9.0 on the Mohs scale ) , it can scratch almost every other mineral . It is commonly used as an abrasive on everything from sandpaper to large tools used in machining metals , plastics , and wood . Some emery is a mix of corundum and other substances , and the mix is less abrasive , with an average Mohs hardness of 8.0 . In addition to its hardness , corundum has a density of 4.02 g/cm3 ( 251 lb/cu ft ) , which is unusually high for a transparent mineral composed of the low-atomic mass elements aluminium and oxygen .",

It is used in dentistry as a component of alginate impression materials as well as for making models of teeth It has the same chemical formula as quartz , SiO2 , but a distinct crystal structure . Both quartz and cristobalite are polymorphs with all the members of the quartz group , which also include coesite , tridymite and stishovite . Cristobalite occurs as white octahedra or spherulites in acidic volcanic rocks and in converted diatomaceous deposits in the Monterey Formation of the US state of California and similar areas . Cristobalite is stable only above 1470 \u00b0C , but can crystallize and persist metastably at lower temperatures . It is named after Cerro San Crist\u00f3bal in Pachuca Municipality , Hidalgo , Mexico . The persistence of cristobalite outside its thermodynamic stability range occurs because the transition from cristobalite to quartz or tridymite is reconstructive , requiring the breaking up and reforming of the silica framework . These frameworks are composed of SiO4 tetrahedra in which every oxygen atom is shared with a neighbouring tetrahedron , so that the chemical formula of silica is SiO2 . The breaking of these bonds required to convert cristobalite to tridymite and quartz requires considerable activation energy and may not happen on a human time frame . Framework silicates are also known as tectosilicates . There is more than one form of the cristobalite framework . At high temperatures , the structure is cubic , Fd3m , No .",

The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is based on scratch hardness comparison , ranging from 1-10 , a value of 10 being the hardest of minerals . Talc is the defining value 1 and therefore the softest of minerals . Any mineral below a value of 2 on Mohs scale of mineral hardness can be scratched by a fingernail . When scraped on a streak plate it produces a white streak , though this indicator is of little importance because most silicate minerals produce a white streak . Talc is translucent to opaque with colors ranging from whitish grey to green with a vitreous and pearly luster . Talc is not soluble in water , but is slightly soluble in dilute mineral acids . Soapstone is a metamorphic rock composed predominantly of talc ."
