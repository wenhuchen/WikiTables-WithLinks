  "/wiki/Manhattan": "Manhattan ( /m\u00e6n\u02c8h\u00e6t\u0259n , m\u0259n-/ ) , often referred to by residents of the New York City area as the City , is the most densely populated of the five boroughs of New York City , and coextensive with the County of New York , one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York . Manhattan serves as the city 's economic and administrative center , cultural identifier , and historical birthplace . The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island , bounded by the Hudson , East , and Harlem rivers ; as well as several small adjacent islands . Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill , a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland , that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River . Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components , each aligned with the borough 's long axis : Lower , Midtown , and Upper Manhattan . Manhattan has been described as the cultural , financial , media , and entertainment capital of the world , and the borough hosts the United Nations Headquarters . Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan , New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world , and Manhattan is home to the world 's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization : the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ . Many multinational media conglomerates are based in Manhattan , and the borough has been the setting for numerous books , films , and television shows . Manhattan real estate has since become among the most expensive in the world , with the value of Manhattan Island , including real estate , estimated to exceed US $ 3 trillion in 2013 ; median residential property sale prices in Manhattan approximated US $ 1,600 per square foot ( $ 17,000/m2 ) as of 2018 , with Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commanding the highest retail rents in the world , at US $ 3,000 per square foot ( $ 32,000/m2 ) per year in 2017 . Manhattan traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan ; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626 . Manhattan is historically documented to have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626 for 60 guilders , which equals roughly $ 1059 in current terms . The territory and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother , the Duke of York .",
