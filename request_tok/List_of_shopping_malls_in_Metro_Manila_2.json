Construction of the interchange was precipitated by the large number of motor vehicles in Manila and the surrounding suburbs in the 1960s , which contributed to significant traffic congestion . On June 25 , 1966 , President Ferdinand Marcos ordered the Department of Public Works to undertake the construction of a number of road projects to be financed through World War II reparations , including the construction of interchanges on vital intersections along EDSA . This order would later lead to the construction of this interchange , replacing a previous roundabout between EDSA , Bonifacio Avenue and the Quirino Highway , and the Magallanes Interchange between EDSA and the South Luzon Expressway ( SLEx ) , which opened in 1975 . A shrine to Andres Bonifacio would later be constructed inside the interchange , which underwent a \u20b113 million renovation in 2009 . Flooding in the area around the Balintawak Interchange is a problem , with the interchange being named in 2014 as one of the twenty-two most flood-prone roadways in Metro Manila . In 2015 , the Manila North Tollways Corporation , the concessionaire of the NLEx , spent close to \u20b170 million to improve the interchange 's drainage systems in order to mitigate flooding .
