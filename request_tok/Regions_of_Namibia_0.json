  "/wiki/Omusati_Region": "Omusati region is one of the fourteen regions of Namibia , its capital is Outapi . The region 's name Omusati , comes from the Oshiwamo word 'omusati ' which means 'Mopane ' . Mopani tree is the dominant species in the region ; the Makalani palms decrease rapidly westwards from the border with Oshana region . The change in vegetation type reflects ecological conditions forming a natural boundary between the two regions . The northern part of this region is far more densely populated than the south , where the grazing is of poor quality and the water generally saline . This is predominantly an agricultural region in which mahangu is cultivated successfully . A canal carries water from the Ruacana river to Oshakati , passing through Outapi . Water from this canal has been used to irrigate a large , government-run farm at Etunda where crops from maize to watermelon to bananas are grown . The electrical network covers towns including Outapi , Ruacana , Tsandi , Oshikuku , and Okahao . The region is traversed by a high standard trunk road which provides a direct link to adjacent regions and the rest of the country . Although passenger and freight transport along this route is easy , the rest of this road network , in common with all the communal areas of northern Namibia , is of poor quality .

The Oshakati-Ongwediva-Ondangwa complex has experienced dramatic urban growth in recent years and forms an important commercial and potential industrial focus . As a whole , it forms the second largest population concentration in Namibia after Windhoek , but it still lacks basic infrastructure and most of the services and facilities normally found in urban areas of this size . The majority of businesses in northern Namibia are located here , providing a significant amount of employment . However , urbanisation is continuing within the region . Omahangu is the principal staple crop grown in Oshana , which is suitable for agriculture . However , the soil is exhausted over much of the central area and requires substantial fertilisation in order to maintain reasonable productivity . Cattle also do well here and herds are extensive . The southern portion of Oshana is an extensive savannah plain stretching as far as the Etosha Pan , but the generally high salinity of soil and water render it unsuitable for grazing or cultivation .
