  "/wiki/Instruction_set": "An instruction set architecture ( ISA ) is an abstract model of a computer . It is also referred to as architecture or computer architecture . A realization of an ISA , such as a central processing unit ( CPU ) , is called an implementation . In general , an ISA defines the supported data types , the registers , the hardware support for managing main memory fundamental features ( such as the memory consistency , addressing modes , virtual memory ) , and the input/output model of a family of implementations of the ISA . An ISA specifies the behavior of machine code running on implementations of that ISA in a fashion that does not depend on the characteristics of that implementation , providing binary compatibility between implementations . This enables multiple implementations of an ISA that differ in performance , physical size , and monetary cost ( among other things ) , but that are capable of running the same machine code , so that a lower-performance , lower-cost machine can be replaced with a higher-cost , higher-performance machine without having to replace software . It also enables the evolution of the microarchitectures of the implementations of that ISA , so that a newer , higher-performance implementation of an ISA can run software that runs on previous generations of implementations . If an operating system maintains a standard and compatible application binary interface ( ABI ) for a particular ISA , machine code for that ISA and operating system will run on future implementations of that ISA and newer versions of that operating system . However , if an ISA supports running multiple operating systems , it does not guarantee that machine code for one operating system will run on another operating system , unless the first operating system supports running machine code built for the other operating system . An ISA can be extended by adding instructions or other capabilities , or adding support for larger addresses and data values ; an implementation of the extended ISA will still be able to execute machine code for versions of the ISA without those extensions . Machine code using those extensions will only run on implementations that support those extensions . The binary compatibility that they provide make ISAs one of the most fundamental abstractions in computing .",
  "/wiki/Computing_platform": "A computing platform or digital platform is the environment in which a piece of software is executed . It may be the hardware or the operating system ( OS ) , even a web browser and associated application programming interfaces , or other underlying software , as long as the program code is executed with it . Computing platforms have different abstraction levels , including a computer architecture , an OS , or runtime libraries . A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run . A platform can be seen both as a constraint on the software development process , in that different platforms provide different functionality and restrictions ; and as an assistant to the development process , in that they provide low-level functionality ready-made . For example , an OS may be a platform that abstracts the underlying differences in hardware and provides a generic command for saving files or accessing the network .",
  "/wiki/IBM_Basic_assembly_language": "Basic Assembly Language ( BAL ) is the commonly used term for a low-level programming language used on IBM System/360 and successor mainframes . Originally , Basic Assembly Language applied only to an extremely restricted dialect designed to run under control of IBM Basic Programming Support ( BPS/360 ) on systems with only 8 KB of main memory , and only a card reader , a card punch , and a printer for input/output - thus the word Basic . However , the full name and the initialism BAL almost immediately attached themselves in popular use to all assembly-language dialects on the System/360 and its descendants . BAL for BPS/360 was introduced with the System/360 in 1964 . Assemblers on other System/360 operating systems through System/370 , System/390 , and System z , as well as the UNIVAC Series 90 mainframes made by Sperry Corporation , and the BS2000 Mainframes currently made by Fujitsu , inherited and extended its syntax .

  "/wiki/IBM_System/360": "The IBM System/360 ( S/360 ) is a family of mainframe computer systems that was announced by IBM on April 7 , 1964 , and delivered between 1965 and 1978 . It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications , from small to large , both commercial and scientific . The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation , allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices . All but the only partially compatible Model 44 and the most expensive systems use microcode to implement the instruction set , which features 8-bit byte addressing and binary , decimal and hexadecimal floating-point calculations . The launch of the System/360 family introduced IBM 's Solid Logic Technology ( SLT ) , a new technology that was the start of more powerful but smaller computers . The slowest System/360 model announced in 1964 , the Model 30 , could perform up to 34,500 instructions per second , with memory from 8 to 64 KB . High performance models came later . The 1967 IBM System/360 Model 91 could execute up to 16.6 million instructions per second . The larger 360 models could have up to 8 MB of main memory , though that much main memory was unusual - a large installation might have as little as 256 KB of main storage , but 512 KB , 768 KB or 1024 KB was more common . Up to 8 megabytes of slower ( 8 microsecond ) Large Capacity Storage ( LCS ) was also available for some models . The IBM 360 was extremely successful in the market , allowing customers to purchase a smaller system with the knowledge they would always be able to migrate upward if their needs grew , without reprogramming of application software or replacing peripheral devices . Many consider the design one of the most successful computers in history , influencing computer design for years to come .",
  "/wiki/IBM_Basic_Programming_Support": "IBM Basic Programming Support/360 ( BPS ) , originally called Special Support , was a set of standalone programs for System/360 mainframes with a minimum of 8 KiB of memory . BPS was developed by IBM 's General Products Division in Endicott , New York . The package included assemblers , IOCS , compilers , sorts , and utilities but no governing control program . BPS components were introduced in a series of product announcements between 1964 and 1965. : pp.319-321 BPS came in two versions - a strictly card system and a tape based system which , contrary to the stated goals , kept a small supervisor permanently resident . : p.14 Programming languages available were Assembler , RPG , and FORTRAN IV ( subset ) . Tape FORTRAN required 16 KiB of memory . : p.5 There were also two versions of the BPS assembler , with the tape version having enhanced capabilities . BPS also had a disk counterpart called BOS . It also required 8 KiB of memory and supported disks such as the IBM 2311 . The group responsible for BPS/BOS went on to develop DOS/360 and TOS/360 as a supposed interim solution when it became evident that OS/360 would be too large to run on 16 KiB systems . BOS and BOS could be used to run standalone applications on a minimal System/360 . One application was the System/360 Work Station for remote job entry to a larger system .",
