  "/wiki/Shoot_'em_up": "Shoot 'em up ( also known as shmup or STG ) is a subgenre of video games within the shooter subgenre in the action genre . There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up . Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement ; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives . The genre 's roots can be traced back to Spacewar ! , one of the earliest computer games , developed in 1962 . The shoot 'em up genre was later established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders , which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978 , and the genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in 1979 . Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s . In the mid-1990s , shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s , and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts , particularly in Japan . Bullet hell games are a subgenre that features overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles , often in visually impressive formations .",
  "/wiki/Arcade_game": "An arcade game or coin-op game is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants , bars and amusement arcades . Most arcade games are video games , pinball machines , electro-mechanical games , redemption games or merchandisers . While exact dates are debated , the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s . Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s , the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost . The Eastern Hemisphere retains a strong arcade industry .",
  "/wiki/Neo_Geo_(console)": "The Neo Geo ( Japanese : \u30cd\u30aa\u30b8\u30aa , Hepburn : Neojio ) , stylised as NEO\u30fbGEO , also written as NEOGEO , is a cartridge-based arcade system board and fourth-generation home video game console released on April 26 , 1990 , by Japanese game company SNK Corporation . It was the first system in SNK 's Neo Geo family . The Neo Geo was marketed as 24-bit ; its CPU is technically a 16/32-bit 68000-based system with an 8/16-bit Z80 coprocessor , while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus . The Neo Geo originally launched as the MVS ( Multi Video System ) coin-operated arcade machine . The MVS offers owners the ability to put up to six different cartridges into a single cabinet , a unique feature that was also a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace , as well as saving money long-term . With its games stored on self-contained cartridges , a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game 's ROM cartridge and cabinet artwork . A home console version was also made , called AES ( Advanced Entertainment System ) . It was originally launched as a rental console for video game stores in Japan ( called Neo Geo Rental System ) , with its high price causing SNK not to release it for home use - this was later reversed due to high demand and it came into the market as a luxury console . The AES had the same raw specs as the MVS and had full compatibility , thus managed to bring a true arcade experience to home users . The Neo Geo was revived along with the brand overall in December 2012 through the introduction of the Neo Geo X handheld and home system . The Neo Geo was a very powerful system when released , more powerful than any video game console at the time , and many arcade systems such as rival Capcom 's CPS , which did not surpass it until the CP System II in 1993 . The Neo Geo MVS was a success during the 1990s due to the cabinet 's low cost , six ROM slots , and compact size .",

  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos .

The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter .",
