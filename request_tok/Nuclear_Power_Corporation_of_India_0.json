  "/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor": "A boiling water reactor ( BWR ) is a type of light water nuclear reactor used for the generation of electrical power . It is the second most common type of electricity-generating nuclear reactor after the pressurized water reactor ( PWR ) , which is also a type of light water nuclear reactor . The main difference between a BWR and PWR is that in a BWR , the reactor core heats water , which turns to steam and then drives a steam turbine . In a PWR , the reactor core heats water , which does not boil . This hot water then exchanges heat with a lower pressure water system , which turns to steam and drives the turbine . The BWR was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory and General Electric ( GE ) in the mid-1950s . The main present manufacturer is GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy , which specializes in the design and construction of this type of reactor .",
  "/wiki/Pressurised_heavy_water_reactor": "A pressurized heavy-water reactor ( PHWR ) is a nuclear reactor that uses heavy water ( deuterium oxide D2O ) as its coolant and neutron moderator . PHWRs frequently use natural uranium as fuel , sometimes very low enriched uranium . The heavy water coolant is kept under pressure to avoid boiling , allowing it to reach higher temperature ( mostly ) without forming steam bubbles , exactly as for pressurized water reactor . While heavy water is very expensive to isolate from ordinary water ( often referred to as light water in contrast to heavy water ) , its low absorption of neutrons greatly increases the neutron economy of the reactor , avoiding the need for enriched fuel . The high cost of the heavy water is offset by the lowered cost of using natural uranium and/or alternative fuel cycles . As of the beginning of 2001 , 31 PHWRs were in operation , having a total capacity of 16.5 GW ( e ) , representing roughly 7.76% by number and 4.7% by generating capacity of all current operating reactors .",

  "/wiki/Madras_Atomic_Power_Station": "Madras Atomic Power Station ( MAPS ) located at Kalpakkam about 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) south of Chennai , India , is a comprehensive nuclear power production , fuel reprocessing , and waste treatment facility that includes plutonium fuel fabrication for fast breeder reactors ( FBRs ) . It is also India 's first fully indigenously constructed nuclear power station , with two units each generating 220 MW of electricity . The first and second units of the station went critical in 1983 and 1985 respectively . The station has reactors housed in a reactor building with double shell containment improving protection also in the case of a loss-of-coolant accident . An Interim Storage Facility ( ISF ) is also located in Kalpakkam .",
  "/wiki/Kalpakkam": "Kalpakkam is a beautiful small town in Tamil Nadu , India , situated on the Coromandel Coast 70 kilometres south of Chennai . A conglomerate of two villages ( Puduppattinam and Sadurangappatinam ) and a DAE township , it is about 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) from Thiruvanmiyur and 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) from Pondicherry . This costal town is rather humid , since it is very close to the sea.Summers here prevail from early March till late May.Temperatures in the Summer vary from 32 degree celsius and can go upto 41 degree celsius . There is no particular Monsoon season for Kalpakkam as rains are unpredictable here , although there is heavy rainfall in the months of October and November , Usually turning into a storm.Coolest months are December and January . A study by the Madras Atomic Power Station ( MAPS ) revealed that the pollution in Kalpakkam is very low , which when compared to the neighbouring city Chennai is 50 times less . Kalpakkam is famous for its nuclear plants and affiliated research installations . These include the Madras Atomic Power Station ( MAPS ) , one of India 's nuclear power plants , Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research ( IGCAR ) , an affiliate of the Department of Atomic Energy ( DAE ) and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre ( BARC ) . Eminent scientists from various different fields of science work here for research and development in nuclear science and engineering . Kalpakkam hosts the only nuclear plant in India with a Fast Breeder Test Reactor ( FBTR ) and a Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor ( PHWR ) . Due to increasing congestion in Kalpakkam arising from the need to accommodate more employees , a new township of Anupuram/Amaipakkam , 8 kilometres ( 5.0 mi ) from Kalpakkam , was inaugurated in 1998 . One of the most tragic events in the history of Kalpakkam took place on 26 December 2004 on a Sunday . Kalpakkam was held in a panic which led to chaos and a lot of people evacuating the town.The tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake generated widespread damage and resulted in 200 deaths in and around Kalpakkam .",

It consists of two 220 MW pressurised water reactor with heavy water as moderator ( PHWR ) . KAPS-1 went critical on 3 September 1992 and began commercial electricity production a few months later on 6 May 1993 . KAPS-2 went critical on 8 January 1995 and began commercial production on 1 September 1995 . In January 2003 , CANDU Owners Group ( COG ) declared KAPS as the best performing pressurised heavy water reactor . KAPS-2 was shut down after a coolant channel leak in July 2015 and a similar issue forced the shutdown of KAPS-1 in March 2016 .
