  "/wiki/Missile_defence": "Missile defense is a system , weapon , or technology involved in the detection , tracking , interception , and destruction of attacking missiles . Originally conceived as a defense against nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) , its application has broadened to include shorter-ranged non-nuclear tactical and theater missiles . The United States , Russia , China , India , Israel , France , and Taiwan have all developed such air defense systems . Italy , France and United Kingdom have PAAMS , the best anti-aircraft missile system in the world . In the United States , missile defense was originally the responsibility of the U.S. Army . The U.S. Missile Defense Agency has developed maritime systems and command and control that will eventually be transferred to the Navy and Air Force for operation and sustainment .",
  "/wiki/Air_defence_system": "Anti-aircraft warfare or counter-air defence is defined by NATO as all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action . They include surface based , subsurface ( submarine launched ) , and air-based weapon systems , associated sensor systems , command and control arrangements and passive measures ( e.g . barrage balloons ) . It may be used to protect naval , ground , and air forces in any location . However , for most countries the main effort has tended to be 'homeland defence ' . NATO refers to airborne air defence as counter-air and naval air defence as anti-aircraft warfare . Missile defence is an extension of air defence as are initiatives to adapt air defence to the task of intercepting any projectile in flight . In some countries , such as Britain and Germany during the Second World War , the Soviet Union , NATO , and the United States , ground-based air defence and air defence aircraft have been under integrated command and control . However , while overall air defence may be for homeland defence including military facilities , forces in the field , wherever they are , invariably deploy their own air defence capability if there is an air threat . A surface-based air defence capability can also be deployed offensively to deny the use of airspace to an opponent . Until the 1950s , guns firing ballistic munitions ranging from 7.62 mm to 152.4 mm [ citation needed ] were the standard weapons ; guided missiles then became dominant , except at the very shortest ranges ( as with close-in weapon systems , which typically use rotary autocannons or , in very modern systems , surface-to-air adaptations of short range air-to-air missiles , often combined in one system with rotary cannons ) .",

  "/wiki/Battle_rifle": "A battle rifle is a military service rifle that is fed ammunition via a detachable magazine and fires a full-powered rifle cartridge . The term battle rifle was created largely out of a need to better differentiate the intermediate-power assault rifles ( e.g . StG-44 , AK-47 , M16 , AUG ) from full-powered automatic rifles ( e.g . FG 42 , FN FAL , M14 , H & K G3 ) as both classes of firearms have a similar appearance and share many of the same features such as detachable magazines , pistol grips , etc . This term may also describe older military full-powered semi-automatic rifles such as the Fedorov Avtomat , M1 Garand , SVT-40 , Gewehr 43 , FN Model 1949 , and the MAS-49 . Before the 1980s and 1990s , the term was not well defined and was used as a general description for all types of military rifles .",
  "/wiki/Assault_rifle": "An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine . Assault rifles were first put into mass production and accepted into widespread service during World War II . Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept , by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world 's armies , replacing full-powered rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles . Examples include the StG 44 , AK-47 and the M16 rifle .",

  "/wiki/CH-47_Chinook": "The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is an American twin-engined , tandem rotor , heavy-lift helicopter developed by American rotorcraft company Vertol and manufactured by Boeing Vertol ( later known as Boeing Rotorcraft Systems ) . The CH-47 is among the heaviest lifting Western helicopters . Its name , Chinook , is from the Native American Chinook people of modern-day Washington state . The Chinook was originally designed by Vertol , which had begun work in 1957 on a new tandem-rotor helicopter , designated as the Vertol Model 107 or V-107 . Around the same time , the United States Department of the Army announced its intention to replace the piston engine-powered Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave with a new , gas turbine-powered helicopter . During June 1958 , the U.S. Army ordered a small number of V-107s from Vertol under the YHC-1A designation ; following testing , it came to be considered by some Army officials to be too heavy for the assault missions and too light for transport purposes . While the YHC-1A would be improved and adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps as the CH-46 Sea Knight , the Army sought a heavier transport helicopter , and ordered an enlarged derivative of the V-107 with the Vertol designation Model 114 . Initially designated as the YCH-1B , on 21 September 1961 , the preproduction rotorcraft performed its maiden flight . In 1962 , the HC-1B was redesignated CH-47A under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system . The Chinook possesses several means of loading various cargoes , including multiple doors across the fuselage , a wide loading ramp located at the rear of the fuselage and a total of three external ventral cargo hooks to carry underslung loads . Capable of a top speed of 170 knots ( 196 mph , 315 km/h ) , upon its introduction to service in 1962 , the helicopter was considerably faster than contemporary 1960s utility helicopters and attack helicopters , and is still one of the fastest helicopters in the US inventory . Improved and more powerful versions of the Chinook have also been developed since its introduction ; one of the most substantial variants to be produced was the CH-47D , which first entered service in 1982 ; improvements from the CH-47C standard included upgraded engines , composite rotor blades , a redesigned cockpit to reduce workload , improved and redundant electrical systems and avionics , and the adoption of an advanced flight control system .",

  "/wiki/Armored_vehicle": "Military vehicles are commonly armoured ( or armored ; see spelling differences ) to withstand the impact of shrapnel , bullets , missiles or shells , protecting the personnel inside from enemy fire . Such vehicles include armoured fighting vehicles like tanks , aircraft and ships . Civilian vehicles may also be armoured . These vehicles include cars used by officials ( e.g. , presidential limousines ) , reporters and others in conflict zones or where violent crime is common . Civilian armoured cars are also routinely used by security firms to carry money or valuables to reduce the risk of highway robbery or the hijacking of the cargo . Armour may also be used in vehicles to protect from threats other than a deliberate attack . Some spacecraft are equipped with specialised armour to protect them against impacts from micrometeoroids or fragments of space junk . Modern aircraft powered by jet engines usually have them fitted with a sort of armour in the form of an aramid composite kevlar bandage around the fan casing or debris containment walls built into the casing of their gas turbine engines to prevent injuries or airframe damage should the fan , compressor , or turbine blades break free . The design and purpose of the vehicle determines the amount of armour plating carried , as the plating is often very heavy and excessive amounts of armour restrict mobility . In order to decrease this problem , some new materials ( nanomaterials ) and material compositions are being researched which include buckypaper , and aluminium foam armour plates .",

The tank destroyer on the other hand is specifically designed to take on enemy tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles . Many are based on a tracked tank chassis , while others are wheeled . Since World War II , gun-armed tank destroyers have fallen out of favor as armies have favored multirole main battle tanks . However , lightly armored anti-tank guided missile ( ATGM ) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank work . The resurgence of expeditionary warfare in the first two decades of the 21st century has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles , sometimes called protected gun systems , which may bear a superficial resemblance to tank destroyers , but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low-intensity operations such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .",

  "/wiki/Zeppelin": "A Zeppelin is a type of rigid airship named after the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8t\u0361s\u025bp\u0259li\u02d0n ] ) who pioneered rigid airship development at the beginning of the 20th century . Zeppelin 's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893 . They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899 . After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design , the word zeppelin came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships . Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG ( DELAG ) , the world 's first airline in revenue service . By mid-1914 , DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights . During World War I , the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and scouts , killing over 500 people in bombing raids in Britain . The defeat of Germany in 1918 temporarily slowed down the airship business . Although DELAG established a scheduled daily service between Berlin , Munich , and Friedrichshafen in 1919 , the airships built for this service eventually had to be surrendered under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , which also prohibited Germany from building large airships . An exception was made allowing the construction of one airship for the US Navy , which saved the company from extinction . In 1926 the restrictions on airship construction were lifted , and with the aid of donations from the public , work was started on the construction of LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin . This revived the company 's fortunes , and during the 1930s , the airships Graf Zeppelin and the larger LZ 129 Hindenburg operated regular transatlantic flights from Germany to North America and Brazil .",

ATGMs range in size from shoulder-launched weapons , which can be transported by a single soldier , to larger tripod-mounted weapons , which require a squad or team to transport and fire , to vehicle and aircraft mounted missile systems . The introduction to the modern battlefield of smaller , man-portable ATGMs with larger warheads has given infantry the ability to defeat light and medium tanks at great ranges , though main battle tanks ( MBTs ) using composite and reactive armors have proven to be resistant to smaller ATGMs . Earlier infantry anti-tank weapons , such as anti-tank rifles , anti-tank rockets and magnetic anti-tank mines , had limited armor-penetration abilities or required a soldier to approach the target closely . As of 2016 , ATGMs were used by over 130 countries and many non-state actors around the world .",
  "/wiki/Demining": "Demining or mine clearance is the process of removing land mines from an area . In military operations , the object is to rapidly clear a path through a minefield , and this is often done with devices such as mine plows and blast waves . By contrast , the goal of humanitarian demining is to remove all of the landmines to a given depth and make the land safe for human use . Specially trained dogs are also used to narrow down the search and verify that an area is cleared . Mechanical devices such as flails and excavators are sometimes used to clear mines . A great variety of methods for detecting landmines have been studied . These include electromagnetic methods , one of which ( ground penetrating radar ) has been employed in tandem with metal detectors . Acoustic methods can sense the cavity created by mine casings . Sensors have been developed to detect vapor leaking from landmines . Animals such as rats and mongooses can safely move over a minefield and detect mines , and animals can also be used to screen air samples over potential minefields . Bees , plants and bacteria are also potentially useful . Explosives in landmines can also be detected directly using nuclear quadrupole resonance and neutron probes .",

Among animals , both insects such as the eyed hawk-moth , and vertebrates such as tree frogs possess camouflage that works in the infra-red as well as in the visible spectrum .",
  "/wiki/Cage_armor": "Slat armor ( or slat armour , see spelling differences ) , also known as bar armor , cage armor and standoff armor , is a type of vehicle armor designed to protect against anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade ( RPG ) attacks . It takes the form of a rigid slatted metal grid fitted around key sections of the vehicle , which disrupts the shaped charge of the warhead by either crushing it , preventing optimal detonation from occurring , or by damaging the fuzing mechanism , preventing detonation outright . Although slat armor is effective against incoming missiles , it does not offer complete protection - as many as 50% of missile impacts are unimpeded by the slat design . Slat armor is more likely to be effective if the cage spacing is less than the diameter of the incoming RPG round , which is commonly 85 mm in diameter ."
