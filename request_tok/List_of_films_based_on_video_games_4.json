  "/wiki/List_of_Front_Mission_media": "Front Mission ( \u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 , Furonto Misshon ) is a series of tactical role-playing video games published by Square , now Square Enix . The first game of the series was published in 1995 and was developed by G-Craft , a studio that was later absorbed by Square as Product Development Division-6 . G-Craft or Division-6 has produced every Front Mission game since , with the exceptions of Front Mission Series : Gun Hazard ( Omiya Soft ) , Front Mission Evolved ( Double Helix Games ) , and Front Mission 2089 : Border of Madness ( h.a.n.d. ) . Since the release of the original game , the series has gone on to encompass several media , including films , manga , novels , radio dramas , and toys . The video games in the series have also ventured into other genres besides tactical role-playing , such as side-scrolling shooter , real-time strategy , third-person shooter , and massively multiplayer online games . The main storyline of the series encompasses seven different games . In addition to these , five spin-off titles have been produced , set both in the same universe as the main games and in alternate worlds . The initial selling point of Front Mission was its storytelling approach . Taking place during the 21st and 22nd centuries , the series revolves around military conflicts and political tension between powerful supranational unions and their member states . Although the Front Mission video games use self-contained , standalone stories , these tie into a greater overarching storyline that encompasses the entire series . In combination with the stories from its other media , the series possesses a level of storytelling depth and continuity comparable to a serial drama .",
