During the war , the ship operated primarily in New Guinea waters . After war service , the corvette was placed in reserve , but she was recommissioned in 1951 as a training vessel , and was repeatedly moved into and out of reserve .

  "/wiki/Bathurst-class_corvette": "The Bathurst-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels produced in Australia during World War II . Originally classified as minesweepers , but widely referred to as corvettes , the Bathurst-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine , anti-mine , and convoy escort role . Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system . The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects . Two vessels are preserved as museum ships .",

In 1990 , the RAN purchased the vessels for conversion into auxiliary minesweepers under the Craft of Opportunity Program ( COOP ) . The vessels could be equipped with a sidescan sonar and various towed minesweeping arrays , and also functioned as berthing tugs .

  "/wiki/Tribal-class_destroyer_(1936)": "The Tribal class , or Afridi class , were a class of destroyers built for the Royal Navy , Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Australian Navy that saw service in World War II . Originally conceived during design studies for a light fleet cruiser , the Tribals evolved into fast , powerful destroyers , with greater emphasis on guns over torpedoes than previous destroyers , in response to new designs by Japan , Italy , and Germany . The Tribals were well admired by their crews and the public when they were in service due to their power , often becoming symbols of prestige while in service . As some of the Royal Navy 's most modern and powerful escort ships , the Tribal class served with distinction in nearly all theatres of World War II . Only a handful of Royal Navy Tribals survived the war , all of which were subsequently scrapped from hard use , while Commonwealth Tribals continued to serve into the Cold War , serving with distinction in the Korean War . Only one Tribal survives to this day : HMCS Haida , which is now a museum ship in Hamilton Harbour , Ontario , Canada .",

The class is somewhat unusual as it is an amalgam of various civilian tankers chartered for naval auxiliary use and as such there have been many different designs of ship in this particular class . Leaf names are traditional tanker names in the RFA , and are recycled when charters end and new vessels are acquired . Thus , there have been multiple uses of the same names , confusingly sometimes sharing a common pennant number . The role of support tanker generally involves the bulk transport of fuel oils between distribution centres , the replenishment of front-line fleet tankers such as the Wave and Fort Victoria classes and using their replenishment at sea ( RAS ) abilities to allow them to directly support naval warships .
