  "/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Medal_(U.S._Army)": "The Distinguished Service Medal ( DSM ) is a military award of the United States Army that is presented to any person who , while serving in any capacity with the United States military , has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility . The performance must be such as to merit recognition for service that is clearly exceptional . Exceptional performance of normal duty will not alone justify an award of this decoration . Separate Distinguished Service Medals exist for the different branches of the military as well as a fifth version of the medal which is a senior award of the United States Department of Defense . The army version of the Distinguished Service Medal is typically referred to simply as the Distinguished Service Medal , while the other branches of service use the service name as a prefix . For service not related to actual war , the term duty of a great responsibility applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war , and requires evidence of conspicuously significant achievement . However , justification of the award may accrue by virtue of exceptionally meritorious service in a succession of high positions of great importance . Awards may be made to persons other than members of the United States Armed Forces for wartime services only , and then only under exceptional circumstances , with the express approval of the president in each case .",
