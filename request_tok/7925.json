The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30 , 1836 , at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou ( a point now known as Allen 's Landing ) and incorporated as a city on June 5 , 1837 . The city is named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas ' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of Allen 's Landing . After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation .

  "/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education": "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) , was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional , even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality . Handed down on May 17 , 1954 , the Court 's unanimous ( 9-0 ) decision stated that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal , and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution . However , the decision 's 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools , and the Court 's second decision in Brown II ( 349 U.S. 294 ( 1955 ) ) only ordered states to desegregate with all deliberate speed . The case originated in 1951 , when the public school district in Topeka , Kansas , refused to enroll the daughter of local black resident Oliver Brown at the school closest to their home , instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black elementary school farther away . The Browns and twelve other local black families in similar situations then filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Topeka Board of Education , alleging that its segregation policy was unconstitutional . A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas rendered a verdict against the Browns , relying on the precedent of the Supreme Court 's 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson , in which the Court had ruled that racial segregation was not in itself a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause if the facilities in question were otherwise equal , a doctrine that had come to be known as separate but equal . The Browns , then represented by NAACP chief counsel Thurgood Marshall , appealed to the Supreme Court , which agreed to hear the case . The Court 's decision in Brown partially overruled Plessy v. Ferguson by declaring that the separate but equal notion was unconstitutional for American public schools and educational facilities . [ note 1 ] It paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement , and a model for many future impact litigation cases . In the American South , especially the Deep South , where racial segregation was deeply entrenched , the reaction to Brown among most white people was noisy and stubborn . Many Southern governmental and political leaders embraced a plan known as Massive Resistance , created by Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd , in order to frustrate attempts to force them to de-segregate their school systems . Four years later , in the case of Cooper v. Aaron , the Court reaffirmed its ruling in Brown , and explicitly stated that state officials and legislators had no power to nullify its ruling .",

  "/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution": "The First Amendment ( Amendment I ) to the United States Constitution prevents the government from making laws which regulate an establishment of religion , prohibit the free exercise of religion , or abridge the freedom of speech , the freedom of the press , the right to peaceably assemble , or the right to petition the government for redress of grievances . It was adopted on December 15 , 1791 , as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights . The Bill of Rights was originally proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification . Initially , the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the Congress , and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today . Beginning with Gitlow v. New York ( 1925 ) , the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states - a process known as incorporation - through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , the Court drew on Thomas Jefferson 's correspondence to call for a wall of separation between church and State , though the precise boundary of this separation remains in dispute . Speech rights were expanded significantly in a series of 20th and 21st century court decisions which protected various forms of political speech , anonymous speech , campaign financing , pornography , and school speech ; these rulings also defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections . The Supreme Court overturned English common law precedent to increase the burden of proof for defamation and libel suits , most notably in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) . Commercial speech , however , is less protected by the First Amendment than political speech , and is therefore subject to greater regulation . The Free Press Clause protects publication of information and opinions , and applies to a wide variety of media . In Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) and New York Times v. United States ( 1971 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraint - pre-publication censorship - in almost all cases . The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action .",
  "/wiki/New_York_Times_v._Sullivan": "New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 ( 1964 ) , was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the freedom of speech protections in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution restrict the ability of American public officials to sue for defamation . Specifically , it held that if a plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit is a public official or person running for public office , not only must he or she prove the normal elements of defamation - publication of a false defamatory statement to a third party - he or she must also prove that the statement was made with actual malice , meaning that the defendant either knew the statement was false or recklessly disregarded whether or not it was true . The case began in 1960 when The New York Times published a full-page advertisement by supporters of Martin Luther King Jr. that criticized the police in Montgomery , Alabama , for their mistreatment of civil rights protesters . However , the ad had several factual inaccuracies , such as the number of times King had been arrested during the protests , what song the protesters had sung , and whether or not students had been expelled for participating . In response , Montgomery police commissioner L. B. Sullivan sued the Times in the local county court for defamation . The judge ruled the advertisement 's inaccuracies were defamatory per se , and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Sullivan and awarded him $ 500,000 in damages . The Times appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court of Alabama , which affirmed it . It then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , which agreed to hear the case and ordered certiorari . In March 1964 , the Court issued a unanimous 9-0 decision holding that the Alabama court 's verdict violated the First Amendment . The decision defended free reporting of the civil rights campaigns in the southern United States . It is one of the key decisions supporting the freedom of the press . Before this decision , there were nearly $ 300 million in libel actions from the southern states outstanding against news organizations , as part of a focused effort by southern officials to use defamation lawsuits as a means of preventing critical coverage of civil rights issues in out-of-state publications .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War": "The secretary of war was a member of the United States president 's Cabinet , beginning with George Washington 's administration .

The secretary of war was the head of the War Department . At first , he was responsible for all military affairs , including naval affairs . In 1798 , the secretary of the Navy was created by statute , and the scope of responsibility for this office was reduced to the affairs of the United States Army . From 1886 onward , the secretary of war was in the line of succession to the presidency , after the vice president of the United States , the speaker of the House of Representatives , the president pro tem of the Senate and the secretary of state . In 1947 , with the passing of the National Security Act of 1947 , the secretary of war was replaced by the secretary of the Army and the secretary of the Air Force , which , along with the secretary of the Navy , have since 1949 been non-Cabinet subordinates under the secretary of defense . The secretary of the Army 's office is generally considered the direct successor to the secretary of war 's office although the secretary of defense took the secretary of war 's position in the Cabinet , and the line of succession to the presidency .",
