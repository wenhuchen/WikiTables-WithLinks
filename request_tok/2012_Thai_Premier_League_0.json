  "/wiki/Bangkok": "Bangkok [ a ] is the capital and most populous city of Thailand . It is known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon [ b ] or simply Krung Thep .

Over fourteen million people ( 22.2 percent ) lived within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census , making Bangkok the nation 's primate city , dwarfing Thailand 's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy . Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century , which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities : Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782 . Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam , later renamed Thailand , during the late-19th century , as the country faced pressures from the West . The city was at the centre of Thailand 's political struggles throughout the 20th century , as the country abolished absolute monarchy , adopted constitutional rule , and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings . The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand 's politics , economy , education , media and modern society . [ citation needed ] The Asian investment boom in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok . The city is now a regional force in finance and business . It is an international hub for transport and health care , and has emerged as a centre for the arts , fashion , and entertainment .
