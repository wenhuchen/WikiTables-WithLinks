It overlooks the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west , with land border with Algeria to the east and Western Sahara to the south ( status disputed ) . Morocco also claims the exclaves of Ceuta , Melilla and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera , all of them under Spanish jurisdiction , as well as several small Spanish-controlled islands of its coast . The capital is Rabat and the largest city is Casablanca . Morocco spans an area of 710,850 km2 ( 274,460 sq mi ) and has a population of over 36 million . Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves .",
  "/wiki/Arapahoe_Formation": "The Arapahoe Formation is a geological formation of latest Cretaceous ( Maastrichtian ) age that is present within the Denver Basin that underlies the Denver , Colorado , area . The formation includes fossil leaves and dinosaur remains , although none of the latter have yet been referred to a specific genus . It also includes aquifers that are important sources of water for the area . The Arapahoe Formation consists of alluvial fan and fluvial deposits that prograded eastward from the growing Rocky Mountain Front Ranges . It rests unconformably on the Laramie Formation , and is conformably overlain by the Denver Formation . It reaches a maximum thickness of about 300 ft ( 91 m ) . The base of the Arapahoe Formation is marked by a discontinuous conglomerate , or where the conglomerate is absent , by sandstone beds that commonly contain large ironstone concretions . The conglomerate is composed principally of chert pebbles , but pebbles of granite , gneiss and schist are also present . Medium grey to brown claystone makes up the majority of the formation , with lesser amounts of light grey to light brown quartzose sandstone . The formation top is marked by a change from sandstone and claystone to the tuffaceous sediments of the overlying Denver Formation . In 2002 the Arapahoe Formation was included as part of a larger unconformity-bounded unit named the D1 Sequence , in order to facilitate basin-wide studies and avoid confusion arising from the lateral and vertical facies changes that occur within the Denver Basin . The base of the D1 coincides with the base of the Arapahoe Formation and is marked by the abrupt change to conglomerate at the top of the Laramie Formation .",

European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

Many of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification . The economy is concentrated around subsistence , with some export agriculture in the more fertile south , and export of raw materials , especially uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its landlocked position , desert terrain , inefficient agriculture , high fertility rates without birth control , and the resulting overpopulation , the poor educational level and poverty of its people , lack of infrastructure , poor healthcare , and environmental degradation . Nigerien society reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state . Historically , what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large states . Since independence , Nigeriens have lived under five constitutions and three periods of military rule .",

By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin .

The Triassic is the first and shortest period of the Mesozoic Era . Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events . The Triassic period is subdivided into three epochs : Early Triassic , Middle Triassic and Late Triassic . Triassic began in the wake of the Permian-Triassic extinction event , which left the Earth 's biosphere impoverished ; it was well into the middle of the Triassic before life recovered its former diversity . Therapsids and archosaurs were the chief terrestrial vertebrates during this time . A specialized subgroup of archosaurs , called dinosaurs , first appeared in the Late Triassic but did not become dominant until the succeeding Jurassic Period . The first true mammals , themselves a specialized subgroup of therapsids , also evolved during this period , as well as the first flying vertebrates , the pterosaurs , who , like the dinosaurs , were a specialized subgroup of archosaurs . The vast supercontinent of Pangaea existed until the mid-Triassic , after which it began to gradually rift into two separate landmasses , Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south . The global climate during the Triassic was mostly hot and dry , with deserts spanning much of Pangaea 's interior . However , the climate shifted and became more humid as Pangaea began to drift apart . The end of the period was marked by yet another major mass extinction , the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event , that wiped out many groups and allowed dinosaurs to assume dominance in the Jurassic .",
