  "/wiki/0-4-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives , 0-4-0 represents one of the simplest possible types , that with two axles and four coupled wheels , all of which are driven . The wheels on the earliest four-coupled locomotives were connected by a single gear wheel , but from 1825 the wheels were usually connected with coupling rods to form a single driven set . The notation 0-4-0T indicates a tank locomotive of this wheel arrangement on which its water and fuel is carried on board the engine itself , rather than in an attached tender . In Britain , the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod-coupled driving wheels . Under the UIC classification used in Europe and , in more recent years , in simplified form in the United States , an 0-4-0 is classified as B ( German and Italian ) if the axles are connected by side rods or gearing and 020 ( French ) , independent of axle motoring . The UIC 's Bo classification for electric and diesel-electric locomotives indicates that the axles are independently motored , which would be 0-2-2-0 under the Whyte notation .",
  "/wiki/Tank_locomotive": "A tank locomotive or tank engine is a steam locomotive that carries its water in one or more on-board water tanks , instead of a more traditional tender . A tank engine may also have a bunker ( or oil tank ) to hold fuel . There are several different types of tank locomotive , distinguished by the position and style of the water tanks and fuel bunkers . The most common type has tanks mounted either side of the boiler . This type originated about 1840 and quickly became popular for industrial tasks , and later for shunting and shorter distance main line duties . Tank locomotives have advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional tender locomotives .",

Georg Christian Carl Henschel founded the factory in 1810 at Kassel . His son Carl Anton Henschel founded another factory in 1837 . In 1848 , the company began manufacturing locomotives . The factory became the largest locomotive manufacturer in Germany by the 20th century . Henschel built 10 articulated steam trucks , using Doble steam designs , for Deutsche Reichsbahn railways as delivery trucks . Several cars were built as well , one of which became Hermann G\u00f6ring 's staff car . In 1935 Henschel was able to upgrade its various steam locomotives to a high-speed Streamliner type with a maximum speeds of up to 140 km/h ( 87 mph ) by the addition of a removable shell over the old steam locomotive .

The sovereign state is separated from the Comoros , Mayotte and Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east . The capital and largest city of Mozambique is Maputo ( formerly known as Louren\u00e7o Marques from 1876 to 1976 ) . Between the first and fifth centuries AD , Bantu-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique from farther north and west . Northern Mozambique lies within the monsoon trade winds of the Indian Ocean . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , a series of Swahili port towns developed here , which contributed to the development of a distinct Swahili culture and language . In the late medieval period , these towns were frequented by traders from Somalia , Ethiopia , Egypt , Arabia , Persia , and India . The voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498 marked the arrival of the Portuguese , who began a gradual process of colonisation and settlement in 1505 . After over four centuries of Portuguese rule , Mozambique gained independence in 1975 , becoming the People 's Republic of Mozambique shortly thereafter . After only two years of independence , the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992 . In 1994 , Mozambique held its first multiparty elections , and has since remained a relatively stable presidential republic , although it still faces a low-intensity insurgency . Mozambique is endowed with rich and extensive natural resources .",

  "/wiki/Tender_(rail)": "A tender or coal-car is a special rail vehicle hauled by a steam locomotive containing its fuel ( wood , coal , or oil ) and water . Steam locomotives consume large quantities of water compared to the quantity of fuel , so their tenders are necessary to keep them running over long distances . A locomotive that pulls a tender is called a tender locomotive . Locomotives that do not have tenders and carry all their fuel and water on board the locomotive ( itself ) instead are called tank locomotives . A brake tender is a tender that is heavy and used ( primarily ) to provide greater braking efficiency .",

  "/wiki/Whyte_notation": "The Whyte notation for classifying steam and some internal combustion locomotives by wheel arrangement was devised by Frederick Methvan Whyte , and came into use in the early twentieth century following a December 1900 editorial in American Engineer and Railroad Journal . The notation counts the number of leading wheels , then the number of driving wheels , and finally the number of trailing wheels , numbers being separated by dashes . Other classification schemes , like UIC classification and the French , Turkish and Swiss systems for steam locomotives , count axles rather than wheels . In the notation a locomotive with two leading axles ( four wheels ) in front , then three driving axles ( six wheels ) and then one trailing axle ( two wheels ) is classified as 4-6-2 , and is commonly known as a Pacific .",
  "/wiki/Diesel_locomotive": "A diesel locomotive is a type of railway locomotive in which the prime mover is a diesel engine . Several types of diesel locomotive have been developed , differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the driving wheels . Early internal combustion locomotives and railcars used kerosene and gasoline as their fuel . Rudolf Diesel patented his first compression ignition engine in 1898 , and steady improvements to the design of diesel engines reduced their physical size and improved their power-to-weight ratios to a point where one could be mounted in a locomotive . Internal combustion engines only operate efficiently within a limited torque range , and while low power gasoline engines could be coupled to mechanical transmissions , the more powerful diesel engines required the development of new forms of transmission . This is because clutches would need to be very large at these power levels and would not fit in a standard 2.5 m ( 8 ft 2 in ) -wide locomotive frame , or wear too quickly to be useful . The first successful diesel engines used diesel-electric transmissions , and by 1925 a small number of diesel locomotives of 600 hp ( 450 kW ) were in service in the United States . In 1930 , Armstrong Whitworth of the United Kingdom delivered two 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) locomotives using Sulzer-designed engines to Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway of Argentina . In 1933 , diesel-electric technology developed by Maybach was used to propel the DRG Class SVT 877 , a high-speed intercity two-car set , and went into series production with other streamlined car sets in Germany starting in 1935 . In the United States , diesel-electric propulsion was brought to high-speed mainline passenger service in late 1934 , largely through the research and development efforts of General Motors dating back to the late 1920s and advances in lightweight car body design by the Budd Company . The economic recovery from World War II caused the widespread adoption of diesel locomotives in many countries . They offered greater flexibility and performance than steam locomotives , as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs .",

It is the second-largest city and metropolitan area in England and the United Kingdom , [ b ] with roughly 1.1 million inhabitants within the city area and 3.8 million inhabitants within the metropolitan area . Birmingham is commonly referred to as the second city of the United Kingdom . Located in the West Midlands county and region in England , approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Central London , Birmingham , as one of the United Kingdom 's major cities , is considered to be the social , cultural , financial , and commercial centre of both the East and West Midlands . Distinctively , Birmingham only has small rivers flowing through it , mainly the River Tame and its tributaries River Rea and River Cole - one of the closest main rivers is the Severn , approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of the city centre . Birmingham 's urban area is the second-largest in the United Kingdom , with its most recently estimated population in 2017 being 2,897,303 , and it also lies within the most populated English district . A market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew in the 18th-century Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham . The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which , under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain , was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz .",

  "/wiki/Narrow_gauge_railway": "A narrow-gauge railway ( narrow-gauge railroad in the US ) is a railway with a track gauge narrower than standard 1,435 mm ( 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ) . Most narrow-gauge railways are between 600 mm ( 1 ft 11 5\u20448 in ) and 1,067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) . Since narrow-gauge railways are usually built with tighter curves , smaller structure gauges , and lighter rails , they can be less costly to build , equip , and operate than standard- or broad-gauge railways ( particularly in mountainous or difficult terrain ) . Lower-cost narrow-gauge railways are often built to serve industries and communities where the traffic potential would not justify the cost of a standard- or broad-gauge line . Narrow-gauge railways have specialized use in mines and other environments where a small structure gauge necessitates a small loading gauge . They also have more general applications . Non-industrial , narrow-gauge mountain railways are ( or were ) common in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and the Pacific Cordillera of Canada , Mexico , Switzerland , the former Yugoslavia , Greece , and Costa Rica . In some countries , narrow gauge is the standard ; Japan , Indonesia , Taiwan , New Zealand , South Africa , and the Australian states of Queensland , Western Australia and Tasmania have a 3 ft 6 in ( 1,067 mm ) gauge , and Malaysia and Thailand have metre-gauge railways .
