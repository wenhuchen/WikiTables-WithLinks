  "/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)": "In the United States Army , United States Marine Corps , and United States Air Force , major general is a two-star general officer rank , with the pay grade of O-8 . Major general ranks above brigadier general and below lieutenant general . [ Note 1 ] A major general typically commands division-sized units of 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers . Major general is equivalent to the two-star rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard , and is the highest permanent peacetime rank in the uniformed services . Higher ranks are technically temporary and linked to specific positions , although virtually all officers promoted to those ranks are approved to retire at their highest earned rank .",
  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",

  "/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York": "The lieutenant governor of New York is a constitutional office in the executive branch of the Government of the State of New York . It is the second highest-ranking official in state government . The lieutenant governor is elected on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term . Official duties dictated to the lieutenant governor under the present New York Constitution are to serve as president of the state senate , serve as acting governor in the absence of the governor from the state or the disability of the governor , or to become governor in the event of the governor 's death , resignation or removal from office via impeachment . Additional statutory duties of the lieutenant governor are to serve on the New York Court for the Trial of Impeachments , the State Defense Council , and on the board of trustees of the College of Environmental Science and Forestry . The office is currently held by Kathy Hochul . Most lieutenant governors take on other duties as assigned to them by the governor . For example , Mary Donohue took on duties in the areas of small business , school violence , and land-use planning , along with serving as a surrogate speaker for the governor in upstate New York . Donohue 's predecessor , Betsy McCaughey Ross , worked on Medicare and education policy , prior to her falling out with Governor George Pataki . Democrat Stan Lundine , who served under Governor Mario Cuomo , was active on technology and housing issues during his two terms in office . While governor and lieutenant governor are elected by a single joint vote in the general election , they run separately in the primaries .

  "/wiki/Mexican\u2013American_War": "The Mexican-American War , [ a ] also known in the United States as the Mexican War and in Mexico as the Intervenci\u00f3n Estadounidense en M\u00e9xico ( American intervention in Mexico ) , [ b ] was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848 . It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas , which was not formally recognized by the Mexican government , who disputed the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican caudillo President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after the Texas Revolution a decade earlier . In 1845 , newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk , who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a further expansion of the United States , sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico . After Mexican forces attacked U.S. forces , the United States Congress declared war . U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of Alta California , and then moved south . Meanwhile , the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in the lower Baja California Territory . The U.S. Army , under Major General Winfield Scott , eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance , having marched west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast , where the U.S. staged its first ever major amphibious landing . The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , forced onto the remnant Mexican government , ended the war and enforced the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States . The U.S. agreed to pay $ 15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $ 3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens . Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the State of Texas and accepted the Rio Grande as its northern border with the United States . The victory and territorial expansion Polk envisioned inspired great patriotism in the United States , but the war and treaty drew some criticism in the U.S. for their casualties , monetary cost , and heavy-handedness , particularly early on . The question of how to treat the new acquisitions also intensified the debate over slavery .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_South_Mountain": "The Battle of South Mountain - known in several early Southern accounts as the Battle of Boonsboro Gap - was fought September 14 , 1862 , as part of the Maryland Campaign of the American Civil War . Three pitched battles were fought for possession of three South Mountain passes : Crampton 's , Turner 's , and Fox 's Gaps . Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , commanding the Union Army of the Potomac , needed to pass through these gaps in his pursuit of Confederate General Robert E. Lee 's precariously divided Army of Northern Virginia . Although the delay bought at South Mountain would allow him to reunite his army and forestall defeat in detail , Lee considered termination of the Maryland Campaign at nightfall .",
  "/wiki/Maryland_Campaign": "The Maryland campaign - or Antietam campaign - occurred September 4-20 , 1862 , during the American Civil War . Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's first invasion of the North was repulsed by the Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , who moved to intercept Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia and eventually attacked it near Sharpsburg , Maryland . The resulting Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest single-day battle in American history . Following his victory in the northern Virginia campaign , Lee moved north with 55,000 men through the Shenandoah Valley starting on September 4 , 1862 . His objective was to resupply his army outside of the war-torn Virginia theater and to damage Northern morale in anticipation of the November elections . He undertook the risky maneuver of splitting his army so that he could continue north into Maryland while simultaneously capturing the Federal garrison and arsenal at Harpers Ferry . McClellan accidentally found a copy of Lee 's orders to his subordinate commanders and planned to isolate and defeat the separated portions of Lee 's army . While Confederate Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson surrounded , bombarded , and captured Harpers Ferry ( September 12-15 ) , McClellan 's army of 102,000 men attempted to move quickly through the South Mountain passes that separated him from Lee . The Battle of South Mountain on September 14 delayed McClellan 's advance and allowed Lee sufficient time to concentrate most of his army at Sharpsburg . The Battle of Antietam ( or Sharpsburg ) on September 17 was the bloodiest day in American military history with over 22,000 casualties . Lee , outnumbered two to one , moved his defensive forces to parry each offensive blow , but McClellan never deployed all of the reserves of his army to capitalize on localized successes and destroy the Confederates . On September 18 , Lee ordered a withdrawal across the Potomac and on September 19-20 , fights by Lee 's rear guard at Shepherdstown ended the campaign .",

The battle was fought on July 21 , 1861 in Prince William County , Virginia , just north of the city of Manassas and about 25 miles west-southwest of Washington , D.C . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy . Yielding to political pressure , Brig . Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig . Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction . McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed ; nevertheless , the Confederates , who had been planning to attack the Union left flank , found themselves at an initial disadvantage . Confederate reinforcements under Brig . Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad , and the course of the battle quickly changed .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Chickamauga": "The Battle of Chickamauga , fought on September 18 - 20 , 1863 , between U.S. and Confederate forces in the American Civil War , marked the end of a Union offensive , the Chickamauga Campaign , in southeastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia . It was the first major battle of the war fought in Georgia , the most significant Union defeat in the Western Theater , and involved the second-highest number of casualties after the Battle of Gettysburg . The battle was fought between the Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans and the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg , and was named for Chickamauga Creek , which meanders near the battle area in northwest Georgia ( and ultimately flows into the Tennessee River about 3.5 miles ( 5.6 km ) northeast of downtown Chattanooga ) . After his successful Tullahoma Campaign , Rosecrans renewed the offensive , aiming to force the Confederates out of Chattanooga . In early September , Rosecrans consolidated his forces scattered in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg 's army out of Chattanooga , heading south . The Union troops followed it and brushed with it at Davis 's Cross Roads . Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided to meet a part of Rosecrans 's army , to defeat it , and then to move back into the city . On September 17 he headed north , intending to attack the isolated XXI Corps . As Bragg marched north on September 18 , his cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry , which were armed with Spencer repeating rifles . Fighting began in earnest on the morning of September 19 . Bragg 's men strongly assaulted but could not break the Union line . The next day , Bragg resumed his assault .",
  "/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Chattanooga": "The Chattanooga campaign was a series of maneuvers and battles in October and November 1863 , during the American Civil War . Following the defeat of Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans 's Union Army of the Cumberland at the Battle of Chickamauga in September , the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg besieged Rosecrans and his men by occupying key high terrain around Chattanooga , Tennessee . Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was given command of Union forces in the West , now consolidated under the Division of the Mississippi . Significant reinforcements also began to arrive with him in Chattanooga from Mississippi and the Eastern Theater . On October 18 , Grant removed Rosecrans from command of the Army of the Cumberland and replaced him with Major General George Henry Thomas . After the opening of a supply line ( the Cracker Line ) to feed the starving men and animals in Chattanooga , a force under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker fought off a Confederate counterattack at the Battle of Wauhatchie on October 28-29 , 1863 . On November 23 , the Army of the Cumberland advanced from the fortifications around Chattanooga to seize the strategic high ground at Orchard Knob while elements of the Union Army of the Tennessee under Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman maneuvered to launch a surprise attack against Bragg 's right flank on Missionary Ridge . On November 24 , Sherman 's men crossed the Tennessee River in the morning and then advanced to occupy high ground at the northern end of Missionary Ridge in the afternoon . The same day , a mixed force of almost three divisions under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker defeated the Confederates in the Battle of Lookout Mountain . The next day they began a movement toward Bragg 's left flank at Rossville . On November 25 , Sherman 's attack on Bragg 's right flank made little progress . Hoping to distract Bragg 's attention , Grant ordered Thomas 's army to advance in the center and take the Confederate positions at the base of Missionary Ridge .",

Stonewall Jackson surrounded , bombarded , and captured the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry , Virginia ( now West Virginia ) , a major victory at relatively minor cost . As Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia advanced down the Shenandoah Valley into Maryland , he planned to capture the garrison at Harpers Ferry to secure his line of supply back to Virginia . Although he was being pursued at a leisurely pace by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan 's Army of the Potomac , outnumbering him more than two to one , Lee chose the risky strategy of dividing his army and sent one portion to converge and attack Harpers Ferry from three directions . Col. Dixon S. Miles , Union commander at Harpers Ferry , insisted on keeping most of the troops near the town instead of taking up commanding positions on the surrounding heights . The slim defenses of the most important position , Maryland Heights , first encountered the approaching Confederates on September 12 , but only brief skirmishing ensued . Strong attacks by two Confederate brigades on September 13 drove the Union troops from the heights . During the fighting on Maryland Heights , the other Confederate columns arrived and were astonished to see that critical positions to the west and south of town were not defended . Jackson methodically positioned his artillery around Harpers Ferry and ordered Maj. Gen. A.P . Hill to move down the west bank of the Shenandoah River in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning . By the morning of September 15 , Jackson had positioned nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and at the base of Loudoun Heights .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Franklin_(1864)": "The Battle of Franklin was fought on November 30 , 1864 , in Franklin , Tennessee , as part of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of the American Civil War . It was one of the worst disasters of the war for the Confederate States Army . Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood 's Army of Tennessee conducted numerous frontal assaults against fortified positions occupied by the Union forces under Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield and was unable to prevent Schofield from executing a planned , orderly withdrawal to Nashville . The Confederate assault of six infantry divisions containing eighteen brigades with 100 regiments numbering almost 20,000 men , sometimes called the Pickett 's Charge of the West , resulted in devastating losses to the men and the leadership of the Army of Tennessee - fourteen Confederate generals ( six killed , seven wounded , and one captured ) and 55 regimental commanders were casualties . After its defeat against Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas in the subsequent Battle of Nashville , the Army of Tennessee retreated with barely half the men with which it had begun the short offensive , and was effectively destroyed as a fighting force for the remainder of the war . The 1864 Battle of Franklin was the second military action in the vicinity ; a battle in 1863 was a minor action associated with a reconnaissance in force by Confederate cavalry leader Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn on April 10 .",

The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population as of 2018 [ update ] is over 8.5 million . The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World . Virginia 's state nickname , the Old Dominion , is a reference to this status . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia .

Part of the Maryland Campaign , it was the first field army-level engagement in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War to take place on Union soil . It was the bloodiest day in United States military history , with a combined tally of 22,717 dead , wounded , or missing . After pursuing the Confederate general Robert E. Lee into Maryland , Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan of the Union Army launched attacks against Lee 's army , in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek . At dawn on September 17 , Maj. Gen.

The combat , between the Union Army of the Potomac commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee , was part of the Union Army 's futile frontal attacks on December 13 against entrenched Confederate defenders on the heights behind the city . It is remembered as one of the most one-sided battles of the war , with Union casualties more than twice as heavy as those suffered by the Confederates . A visitor to the battlefield described the battle to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as a butchery . Burnside 's plan was to cross the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg in mid-November and race to the Confederate capital of Richmond before Lee 's army could stop him . Bureaucratic delays prevented Burnside from receiving the necessary pontoon bridges in time and Lee moved his army to block the crossings . When the Union army was finally able to build its bridges and cross under fire , direct combat within the city resulted on December 11-12 . Union troops prepared to assault Confederate defensive positions south of the city and on a strongly fortified ridge just west of the city known as Marye 's Heights .

They are mostly blood descendants of the Seminole people , free blacks and of escaped slaves ( called maroons ) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida . Many have Seminole lineage , but due to the stigma of having dark skin , they all have been categorized as slaves or freedmen . Historically , the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole . Some were held as slaves , particularly of Seminole leaders , but the Black Seminole had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes , including the right to bear arms . Today , Black Seminole descendants live primarily in rural communities around the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma . Its two Freedmen 's bands , the Caesar Bruner Band and the Dosar Barkus Band , are represented on the General Council of the Nation . Other centers are in Florida , Texas , the Bahamas , and northern Mexico . Since the 1930s , the Seminole Freedmen have struggled with cycles of exclusion from the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma . In 1990 , the tribe received the majority of a $ 46 million judgement trust by the United States , for seizure of lands in Florida in 1823 , and the Freedmen have worked to gain a share of it . In 2004 the US Supreme Court ruled the Seminole Freedmen could not bring suit without the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma , which refused to join them on the claim issue .

  "/wiki/Oliver_O._Howard": "Oliver Otis Howard ( November 8 , 1830 - October 26 , 1909 ) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War . As a brigade commander in the Army of the Potomac , Howard lost his right arm while leading his men against Confederate forces at the Battle of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines in June 1862 , an action which later earned him the Medal of Honor . As a corps commander , he suffered two humiliating defeats at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg in May and July 1863 , but recovered from the setbacks as a successful corps and later army commander in the Western Theater . Known as the Christian general because he tried to base his policy decisions on his deep religious piety , he was given charge of the Freedmen 's Bureau in mid-1865 , with the mission of integrating the former slaves into Southern society and politics during the second phase of the Reconstruction Era . Howard took charge of labor policy , setting up a system that required freed people to work on former plantation land under pay scales fixed by the Bureau , on terms negotiated by the Bureau with white land owners . Howard 's Bureau was primarily responsible for the legal affairs of the freedmen . He attempted to protect freed blacks from hostile conditions , but lacked adequate power , and was repeatedly frustrated by President Andrew Johnson . Howard 's allies , the Radical Republicans , won control of Congress in the 1866 elections and imposed Radical Reconstruction , with the result that freedmen were given the vote . With the help and advice of the Bureau , freedmen joined Republican coalitions and won at the ballot boxes of most of the southern states . Howard was also a leader in promoting higher education for freedmen , most notably in founding Howard University in Washington and serving as its president 1867-73 . After 1874 , Howard commanded troops in the West , conducting a famous campaign against the Nez Perce tribe . Utley ( 1987 ) concludes that his leadership against the Apaches in 1872 , against the Nez Perce in 1877 , the Bannocks and Paiutes in 1878 , and against the Sheepeaters in 1879 all add up to a lengthy record , although he did not fight as much as George Custer and Nelson Miles .",

On May 31 , Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston attempted to overwhelm two Federal corps that appeared isolated south of the Chickahominy River . The Confederate assaults , although not well coordinated , succeeded in driving back the IV Corps and inflicting heavy casualties .

Johnston was seriously wounded during the action , and command of the Confederate army devolved temporarily to Maj. Gen. G.W . Smith . On June 1 , the Confederates renewed their assaults against the Federals , who had brought up more reinforcements , but made little headway . Both sides claimed victory . Although the battle was tactically inconclusive , it was the largest battle in the Eastern Theater up to that time ( and second only to Shiloh in terms of casualties thus far , about 11,000 total ) .

He succeeded his father Tuekakas ( Chief Joseph the Elder ) in the early 1870s . Chief Joseph led his band of Nez Perce during the most tumultuous period in their history , when they were forcibly removed by the United States federal government from their ancestral lands in the Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon onto a significantly reduced reservation in the Idaho Territory . A series of violent encounters with white settlers in the spring of 1877 culminated in those Nez Perce who resisted removal , including Joseph 's band and an allied band of the Palouse tribe , to flee the United States in an attempt to reach political asylum alongside the Lakota people , who had sought refuge in Canada under the leadership of Sitting Bull . At least 700 men , women , and children led by Joseph and other Nez Perce chiefs were pursued by the U.S. Army under General Oliver O. Howard in a 1,170-mile ( 1,900 km ) fighting retreat known as the Nez Perce War . The skill with which the Nez Perce fought and the manner in which they conducted themselves in the face of incredible adversity earned them widespread admiration from their military opponents and the American public , and coverage of the war in U.S. newspapers led to popular recognition of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce . In October 1877 , after months of fugitive resistance , most of the surviving remnants of Joseph 's band were cornered in northern Montana Territory , just 40 miles ( 64 km ) from the Canadian border . Unable to fight any longer , Chief Joseph surrendered to the Army with the understanding that he and his people would be allowed to return to the reservation in western Idaho . He was instead transported between various forts and reservations on the southern Great Plains before being moved to the Colville Indian Reservation in the state of Washington , where he died in 1904 . Chief Joseph 's life remains iconic of the American Indian Wars . For his passionate , principled resistance to his tribe 's forced removal , Joseph became renowned as a humanitarian and peacemaker .",

Members of the Sahaptin language group , the Niim\u00edipuu were the dominant people of the Columbia Plateau for much of that time , especially after acquiring the horses that led them to breed the appaloosa horse in the 18th century . Prior to first contact with Western civilization the Nimiipuu were economically and culturally influential in trade and war , interacting with other indigenous nations in a vast network from the western shores of Oregon and Washington , the high plains of Montana , and the northern Great Basin in southern Idaho and northern Nevada . After first contact , the name Nez Perce was given to the Niim\u00edipuu and the nearby Chinook people by French explorers and trappers . The name means pierced nose , but only the Chinook used that form of decoration . Today they are a federally recognized tribe , the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho , and govern their Indian reservation in Idaho through a central government headquartered in Lapwai , Idaho known as the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee ( NPTEC ) .

George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south .

Including inactive reserves , more than fifty thousand soldiers from each side took part , using more than two hundred pieces of artillery and three warships . The Seven Days Battles were the climax of the Peninsula Campaign , during which McClellan 's Army of the Potomac sailed around the Confederate lines , landed at the tip of the Virginia Peninsula , southeast of Richmond , and struck inland towards the Confederate capital . Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston fended off McClellan 's repeated attempts to take the city , slowing Union progress on the peninsula to a crawl . When Johnston was wounded , Lee took command and launched a series of counterattacks , collectively called the Seven Days Battles . These attacks culminated in the action on Malvern Hill . The Union 's V Corps , commanded by Brig . Gen. Fitz John Porter , took up positions on the hill on June 30 . McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle , having boarded the ironclad USS Galena and sailed down the James River to inspect Harrison 's Landing , where he intended to locate the base for his army . Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps . Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate Maj. Gen. John Magruder to be late for the battle , an excess of caution delayed Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger , and Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson had problems collecting the Confederate artillery .",

The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",
