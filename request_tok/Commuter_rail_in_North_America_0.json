European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

The central common block is the New Haven Green , a 16-acre ( 6 ha ) square at the center of Downtown New Haven . The Green is now a National Historic Landmark , and the Nine Square Plan is recognized by the American Planning Association as a National Planning Landmark . New Haven is the home of Yale University . As New Haven 's biggest taxpayer and employer , Yale serves as an integral part of the city 's economy .

Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",
  "/wiki/West_Virginia": "West Virginia ( /v\u0259r\u02c8d\u0292\u026ani\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is a state located in the Appalachian region of the Southern United States , and is also considered to be a part of the Mid-Atlantic Southeast Region . It is bordered by Pennsylvania to the north , Maryland to the east and northeast , Virginia to the southeast , Kentucky to the southwest , and Ohio to the northwest . West Virginia is the 41st largest state by area , and is ranked 38th in population . The capital and largest city is Charleston . West Virginia became a state following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861 , at the start of the American Civil War . Delegates from the Unionist counties of northwestern Virginia decided to break away from Virginia , which also included secessionist counties in the new state . West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20 , 1863 , and was a key border state during the war . It was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state , the first to separate from any state since Maine separated from Massachusetts , and was one of two states admitted to the Union during the American Civil War ( the other being Nevada ) . While a portion of its residents held slaves , most of the residents were yeoman farmers , and the delegates provided for gradual abolition of slavery in the new state Constitution . The Census Bureau and the Association of American Geographers classify West Virginia as part of the Southern United States . However , the Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies the state as a part of the Mid-Atlantic region . The northern panhandle extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio , with the West Virginia cities of Wheeling and Weirton just across the border from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area , while Bluefield is less than 70 miles ( 110 km ) from North Carolina .",

Worcester was considered its own distinct region apart from Boston until the 1970s . Since then , Boston 's suburbs have been moving out further westward , especially after the construction of Interstate 495 and Interstate 290 .

It is the fourth busiest commuter rail system in the United States by ridership and the largest and busiest commuter rail system outside the New York City metropolitan area .

The estimated busiest day for Metra ridership occurred on November 4 , 2016 - the day of the Chicago Cubs 2016 World Series victory rally . Using Chicago 's rail infrastructure , much of which dates to the 1850s , the Illinois General Assembly established the parent Regional Transportation Authority ( RTA ) to consolidate all public transit operations in the Chicago area , including commuter rail . The RTA 's creation was a result of the anticipated failure of commuter service operated and owned by various private railroad companies in the 1970s . In 1984 , RTA formed a commuter rail division to focus on rail operations , which branded itself as Metra in 1985 . Freight rail companies still operate four of Metra 's routes under contracted service agreements . Metra owns all rolling stock and is responsible for all stations along with the respective municipalities . Since its inception , Metra has directed more than $ 5 billion into the commuter rail system of the Chicago metropolitan area .",
