  "intro": "The list of Alpha Phi Alpha brothers (commonly referred to as Alphas) includes initiated and honorary members of Alpha Phi Alpha (\u0391\u03a6\u0391), the first inter-collegiate Greek-letter organization established for Black college students. Founded in December 1905 as a literary society with the first presiding officer being CC Poindexter, it was established as a fraternity on December 4, 1906 at Ithaca, New York. Alpha Phi Alpha opened chapters at other colleges, universities, and cities, and named them with Greek letters. Members traditionally pledge into a chapter, although some members were granted honorary status prior to the fraternity's discontinuation of the practice of granting honorary membership. A chapter name ending in Lambda denotes an alumni chapter. The only alumni chapter that does not end in Lambda is Rho Chapter, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. No chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha is designated Omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet that traditionally signifies the end. Deceased brothers are respectfully referred to as having their membership transferred to Omega Chapter, the fraternity's chapter of sweet rest. Frederick Douglass is distinguished as the only member initiated posthumously when he became an exalted honorary member of Omega chapter in 1921."
