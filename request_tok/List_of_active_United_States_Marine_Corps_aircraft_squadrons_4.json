  "/wiki/F/A-18_Hornet": "The McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet is a twin-engine , supersonic , all-weather , carrier-capable , multirole combat jet , designed as both a fighter and attack aircraft ( hence the F/A designation ) . Designed by McDonnell Douglas ( now Boeing ) and Northrop , the F/A-18 was derived from the latter 's YF-17 in the 1970s for use by the United States Navy and Marine Corps . The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations , and since 1986 , by the U.S. Navy 's Flight Demonstration Squadron , the Blue Angels . The F/A-18 was designed to be a highly versatile aircraft due to its avionics , cockpit displays , and excellent aerodynamic characteristics , with the ability to carry a wide variety of weapons . The aircraft can perform fighter escort , fleet air defense , suppression of enemy air defenses , air interdiction , close air support , and aerial reconnaissance . Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset , though it has been criticized for its lack of range and payload compared to its earlier contemporaries , such as the Grumman F-14 Tomcat in the fighter and strike fighter role , and the Grumman A-6 Intruder and LTV A-7 Corsair II in the attack role . The Hornet first saw combat action during the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and subsequently participated in the 1991 Gulf War and 2003 Iraq War . The F/A-18 Hornet served as the baseline for the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , its larger , evolutionary redesign .",

Located in the South Central region , Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east , Arkansas to the northeast , Oklahoma to the north , New Mexico to the west , and the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas to the southwest , and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast . Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S. , while San Antonio is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas-Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , respectively . Other major cities include Austin , the second-most populous state capital in the U.S. , and El Paso . Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic , and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from Mexico . The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word taysha , which means friends in the Caddo language . Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10% of Texas 's land area is desert . Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend . The term six flags over Texas [ note 1 ] refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory .",

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas .
