  "/wiki/Forward_pass": "In several forms of football a forward pass is a throwing of the ball in the direction that the offensive team is trying to move , towards the defensive team 's goal line . The forward pass is one of the main distinguishers between gridiron football ( American football and Canadian football ) in which the play is legal and widespread , and rugby football ( union and league ) from which the North American games evolved , in which the play is illegal . In some football codes , such as association football ( soccer ) , the kicked forward pass is used so ubiquitously that it is not thought of as a distinct kind of play at all . In these sports , the concept of offside is used to regulate who can be in front of the play or be nearest to the goal . However , this has not always been the case . Some earlier incarnations of football allowed unlimited forward passing , while others had strict offside rules similar to rugby . The development of the forward pass in American football shows how the game has evolved from its rugby roots into the distinctive game it is today . Illegal and experimental forward passes had been attempted as early as 1876 , but the first legal forward pass in American football took place in 1906 , after a change in rules . Another change in rules occurred on January 18 , 1951 , which established that no center , tackle , or guard could receive a forward pass ( unless such a player announces his intent to the referee beforehand that he will be an eligible receiver , called a tackle-eligible play ) . Today , the only linemen who can receive a forward pass are the ends ( tight ends and wide receivers ) . Current rules regulate who may throw and who may receive a forward pass , and under what circumstances , as well as how the defensive team may try to prevent a pass from being completed . The primary pass thrower is the quarterback , and statistical analysis is used to determine a quarterback 's success rate at passing in various situations , as well as a team 's overall success at the passing game .",

  "/wiki/Division_I-A": "The NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , formerly known as Division I-A , is the top level of college football in the United States . The FBS is the most competitive subdivision of NCAA Division I , which itself consists of the largest and most competitive schools in the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) . As of 2018 , there are 10 conferences and 130 schools in FBS . College football is one of the most popular spectator sports throughout much of the United States , and the top schools generate tens of millions of dollars in yearly revenue . Top FBS teams draw tens of thousands of fans to games , and the ten largest American stadiums by capacity all host FBS teams or games . College athletes are not paid , but colleges are allowed to provide players with non-monetary compensation such as athletic scholarships that provide for tuition , housing , and books . Unlike other NCAA divisions and subdivisions , the NCAA does not officially award an FBS football national championship , nor does it sanction a playoff tournament to determine such a champion on the field . Instead , organizations such as the Associated Press and AFCA have historically sought to rank the teams and crown a national champion , by taking a vote of sports writers and coaches , respectively . In place of such a playoff , various cities across the United States hold their own post-season contests , called bowl games , in which they traditionally invite teams to participate in them . Historically , these bowl games were mostly considered to be exhibition games involving a payout to participating teams . However , in the modern era they are considered the de facto post-season . There have been agreements in recent decades ( such as the Bowl Coalition from 1992 to 1994 , the Bowl Alliance from 1995 to 1997 , the Bowl Championship Series from 1998 to 2013 , and the College Football Playoff from 2014 to the present ) by the premier FBS conferences and bowl games to organize matchups so that the FBS national championship is decided on the field .",
