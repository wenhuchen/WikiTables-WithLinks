  "/wiki/Point_Guard": "The point guard ( PG ) , also called the one or point , is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game . A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position . Point guards are expected to run the team 's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time . Above all , the point guard must understand and accept their coach 's game plan ; in this way , the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football , a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer ( association football ) . They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game . A point guard , like other player positions in basketball , specializes in certain skills . Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team , or sometimes for themselves . Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor , who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates . This involves setting up plays on the court , getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score , and controlling the tempo of the game . A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets . Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders . A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock , the score , the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams , etc .",

  "/wiki/Shooting_Guard": "The shooting guard ( SG ) , also known as the two or off guard , is one of the five traditional positions in a regulation basketball game . A shooting guard 's main objective is to score points for their team and steal the ball on defense . Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well ; these players are known colloquially as combo guards . A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman . In the NBA , shooting guards usually range from 6 ' 2 ( 1.88 m ) to 6 ' 7 ( 2.01 m ) , and from 5 ' 8 ( 1.73 m ) to 5 ' 11 ( 1.80 m ) in the WNBA .",
  "/wiki/Small_Forward": "The small forward ( SF ) , also known as the three , is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game . Small forwards are typically shorter , quicker , and leaner than power forwards and centers , but typically taller , larger and stronger than either of the guard positions . The small forward is considered to be perhaps the most versatile of the five main basketball positions . In the NBA , small forwards usually range from 6 ' 4 ( 1.93 m ) to 6 ' 8 ( 2.03 m ) without shoes while in the WNBA , small forwards are usually between 5 ' 10 ( 1.78 m ) to 6 ' 1 ( 1.85 m ) . Small forwards are responsible for scoring points , defending and often as secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forward and center , although a few have considerable passing responsibilities . Many small forwards in professional basketball are prolific scorers . The styles with which small forwards amass their points vary widely . Some players at the position are very accurate shooters , others prefer to initiate physical contact with opposing players , and still others are primarily slashers who also possess jump shots . In some cases , small forwards position on the baseline or as off-the-ball specialists . Small forwards who are defensive specialists are very versatile as they can often guard multiple positions using their size , speed , and strength . Small forwards that are inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame include Julius Erving , Cheryl Miller , Larry Bird , Sheryl Swoopes , James Worthy , Elgin Baylor , Scottie Pippen , Dominique Wilkins and Rick Barry .",

  "/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)": "The power forward ( PF ) , also known as the four , is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game . Power forwards play a role similar to that of center . They typically play offensively with their backs towards the basket and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense . The power forward position entails a variety of responsibilities , one of which is rebounding . Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot , and several players have become very accurate from 12 to 18 feet ( 3.7 to 5.5 m ) . Earlier , these skills were more typically exhibited in the European style of play . Some power forwards , known as stretch fours , have since extended their shooting range to three-point field goals . In the NBA , power forwards usually range from 6\u2032 6\u2033 ( 1.98 m ) to 6\u2032 10\u2033 ( 2.08 m ) without shoes while in the WNBA , power forwards are usually between 6\u2032 0\u2033 ( 1.83 m ) and 6\u2032 3\u2033 ( 1.91 m ) . Despite the averages , a variety of players fit tweener roles which finds them in the small forward or center position depending on matchups and coaching decisions . [ citation needed ] Some power forwards often play the center position and have the skills , but lack the height that is usually associated with that position . Power forwards that are inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame include Karl Malone , Denise Curry , Dolph Schayes , Kevin McHale , Charles Barkley , Elvin Hayes , Bob Pettit , Dennis Rodman , and Katrina McClain Johnson .",

  "/wiki/Center_(basketball)": "The center ( C ) , also known as the five position , or the big man , is one of the five positions in a basketball game . The center is normally the tallest player on the team , and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well . In the NBA , the center is usually 6 feet 10 inches ( 2.08 m ) or taller and usually weighs 240 pounds ( 110 kg ) or more . They traditionally have played close to the basket in the low post . Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency . In the 1950s and 1960s , George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers . With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979-80 season , however , NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished . A center with the ability to shoot outside from three-point range is known as stretch five .",
