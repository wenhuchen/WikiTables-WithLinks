Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation ( the last ice age ) , and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean . Niagara Falls is famed both for its beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric power . Balancing recreational , commercial , and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century .",
