Afro-Eurasia encompasses 84,980,532 square kilometres ( 32,811,167 sq mi ) , a little over half the world 's land area , and has a population of approximately 6 billion people , roughly 86% of the world population .",
  "/wiki/Americas": "The Americas ( also collectively called America ; French : Am\u00e9rique , Dutch : Amerika , Spanish and Portuguese : Am\u00e9rica ) comprise the totality of the continents of North and South America . Together , they make up most of the land in Earth 's western hemisphere and comprise the New World . Along with their associated islands , they cover 8% of Earth 's total surface area and 28.4% of its land area . The topography is dominated by the American Cordillera , a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast . The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins , such as the Amazon , St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes basin , Mississippi , and La Plata . Since the Americas extend 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) from north to south , the climate and ecology vary widely , from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada , Greenland , and Alaska , to the tropical rain forests in Central America and South America . Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between 42,000 and 17,000 years ago . A second migration of Na-Dene speakers followed later from Asia . The subsequent migration of the Inuit into the neoarctic around 3500 BCE completed what is generally regarded as the settlement by the indigenous peoples of the Americas . The first known European settlement in the Americas was by the Norse explorer Leif Erikson . However , the colonization never became permanent and was later abandoned . The Spanish voyages of Christopher Columbus from 1492 to 1502 resulted in permanent contact with European ( and subsequently , other Old World ) powers , which eventually led to the Columbian exchange and inaugurated a period of exploration , conquest , and colonization whose effects and consequences persist to the present .",

Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s . Java dominates Indonesia politically , economically and culturally . Four of Indonesia 's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java : Ujung Kulon National Park , Borobudur Temple , Prambanan Temple , and Sangiran Early Man Site . Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions from geologic subduction between Sunda Plate and Australian Plate , Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass at about 138,800 square kilometres ( 53,600 sq mi ) . A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east-west spine along the island . Three main languages are spoken on the island : Javanese , Sundanese , and Madurese , where Javanese is the most spoken ; it is the native language of about 60 million Javanese people in Indonesia , most of whom live on Java .

The island 's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats . The archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago . Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and 550 AD by Indianized Austronesian peoples , arriving on outrigger canoes from Indonesia . The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of Hinduism and Buddhism , along with native Indonesian culture . These were joined around the 9th century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa .

The largest offshore island , Mannar Island , leads to Adam 's Bridge . Adam 's Bridge , a land connection to the Indian mainland , is now mostly submerged with only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level . According to temple records , this natural causeway was formerly complete , but was breached by a violent storm ( probably a cyclone ) in 1480 . The formation is also known as Rama 's Bridge , as according to Hindu mythology , it was constructed during the rule of Lord Rama . Sri Lanka 's climate includes tropical monsoons : the northeast monsoon ( December to March ) , and the southwest monsoon ( June to October ) .

The native Ta\u00edno people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of the Europeans , dividing it into five chiefdoms . The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years , and lived around the Caribbean islands . The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization . Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island , landing here on his first voyage in 1492 . The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas , the oldest continuously inhabited city , and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World . Meanwhile , France occupied the western third of Hispaniola , naming their colony Saint-Domingue , which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804 . After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821 . The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres , intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia , but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822 .",

The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , who migrated from South America . The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue . French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations , worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa , which made the colony one of the richest in the world . In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789-99 ) , slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture . After 12 years of conflict , Napoleon Bonaparte 's forces were defeated by Louverture 's successor , Jean-Jacques Dessalines ( later Emperor Jacques I ) , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty on 1 January 1804 - the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the first country to abolish slavery , and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt .",
