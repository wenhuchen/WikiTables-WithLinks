It is an industrial area with textile , metallurgical , and glass industries . The houses of Manresa are arranged around the basilica of Santa Maria de la Seu . Saint Ignatius of Loyola stopped to pray in the town on his way back from Montserrat in 1522 . He also read in solitude in a cave near the town for a year , which contributed to the formulation of his Spiritual Exercises . As such , the town is a place of pilgrimage for Catholics . It is believed the comarcal name Bages comes from a corruption of the Latin Bacchus due to the extensive production of wine in the area . The wine was grown mainly in terraced vineyards , and many of these old terraces can be seen today . Wine ceased to be the main product of the area as a consequence of phylloxera , but is still a very important part of the Manresa/Bages economy . During the Napoleonic invasion , the volunteer troops of Manresa ( sometent in Catalan language ) defeated the French troops in the Bruch Pass ( June 1808 ) , but the retreating French burned and demolished much of the town .

After the discovery of the Americas , Seville became one of the economic centres of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n ( House of Trade ) wielded its power , opening a Golden Age of arts and literature . In 1519 , Ferdinand Magellan departed from Seville for the first circumnavigation of the Earth . Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history , the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city 's culture ; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of C\u00e1diz .",
