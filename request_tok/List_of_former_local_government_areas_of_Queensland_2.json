  "/wiki/Shire_of_Albert": "The Shire of Albert was a local government area in Queensland , located south of the capital , Brisbane , and taking in areas to the north and west of the Gold Coast . It was named after the Prince Consort of the United Kingdom , and husband of Queen Victoria , Prince Albert . When created in 1948 , it was primarily a rural area , but its growth started in earnest in the late 1960s with the development of Logan on Brisbane 's southern frontier . After the separate creation of Logan as a shire ( later City ) in 1978 , Albert lost most of its population and became more centred upon the Gold Coast , which experienced a massive period of growth from then until the Shire 's amalgamation with the City of Gold Coast in 1995 .",

Despite this status , the City consists of largely suburban and coastal communities , featuring a somewhat disjointed urbanisation around major suburbs interspersed with bushland ; there is no clear city centre . Large mainland suburbs include Capalaba , Cleveland , Victoria Point , and Redland Bay . The latter is the City 's namesake , due to the colour of its fertile soil .
