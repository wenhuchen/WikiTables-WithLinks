  "/wiki/ESP-Disk": "ESP-Disk is a New York-based record company and label founded in 1964 by lawyer Bernard Stollman . Though it originally existed to release Esperanto-based music , starting with its second release ( Albert Ayler 's Spiritual Unity ) , ESP became the most important exponent of what is commonly referred to as free jazz . ESP also released recordings by uncommercial underground rock acts including the Fugs , The Godz and Pearls Before Swine . Bernard Stollman faced allegations of not paying royalties to the artists that were signed to ESP-Disk . Tom Rapp of the band Pearls Before Swine claimed that We never got any money from ESP . Never , not even like a hundred dollars or something . My real sense is that he [ Stollman ] was abducted by aliens , and when he was probed it erased his memory of where all the money was . Peter Stampfel of the band Holy Modal Rounders and The Fugs claimed that Stollman told him that the contract says that all rights belong to me . You have no royalties ever , ever , ever . The publishing is mine . You do n't own the songs anymore . We do n't owe you anything .",
