At the same Olympics , he also won silver in the 1500 m and bronze over 5,000 m.

At the 1932 Olympics in Lake Placid , Evensen won a silver medal in the 500 m. Evensen and compatriot Ivar Ballangrud were the only European Olympic speed skating medalists during those games . This can mostly be attributed to the fact that the races were skated in pack-style ( having all competitors skate at the same time ) , a format that most European skaters were not familiar with . At the World Allround Championships , Evensen finished first in 1927 and 1934 , second in 1931 , and third in 1926 , 1928 , and 1932 .
