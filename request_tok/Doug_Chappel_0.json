  "/wiki/Music_Video": "A music video is a short film that integrates a song with imagery , and is produced for promotional or artistic purposes . Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings . There are also cases where songs are used in tie-in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song . Tie-ins and merchandising can be used for toys or for food or other products . Although the origins of the music video date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s , they again came into prominence in the 1980s when the channel MTV ( originally Music Television ) based its format around the medium . Prior to the 1980s , these kinds of videos were described by various terms including illustrated song , filmed insert , promotional ( promo ) film , promotional clip , promotional video , song video , song clip or film clip . Music videos use a wide range of styles and contemporary video-making techniques , including animation , live action , documentary , and non-narrative approaches such as abstract film . Some music videos combine different styles with the music , such as animation and live action . Combining these styles and techniques has become more popular because of the variety for the audience . Many music videos interpret images and scenes from the song 's lyrics , while others take a more thematic approach . Other music videos may not have any concept , being merely a filmed version of the song 's live concert performance .",

It is also commonly referred to as the Australian Government , the Commonwealth Government , or the Federal Government . The legislature , also known as the Parliament of Australia , or simply Parliament , is made up of democratically-elected representatives from around Australia . These representatives meet at Parliament House in Canberra to discuss legislation and make laws for the benefit of the nation . The issues that they can make laws on are defined by sections 51 and 122 of the Constitution . The Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two separate chambers : the House of Representatives ( or 'the lower house ' ) and the Senate ( or 'the upper house ' ) . The House of Representatives has 151 members , each representing a different area of the country ( 'electorate ' ) . Each electorate has roughly the same number of registered voters within its boundary , meaning that states with larger populations have more electorates and therefore more representatives in the House . The Senate is composed of 76 members . Unlike the House of Representatives , membership of the Senate is divided evenly between the states . Each state has 12 senators , and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have 2 senators each . The Senate was established this way to ensure that the larger states could not use their majority in the House of Representatives to pass laws that disadvantaged the smaller states .",
