Located along the Tigris River , the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate . Within a short time of its inception , Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural , commercial , and intellectual center of the Muslim world . This , in addition to housing several key academic institutions , including the House of Wisdom , as well as hosting a multiethnic and multireligious environment , garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the Centre of Learning . Baghdad was the largest city in the world for much of the Abbasid era during the Islamic Golden Age , peaking at a population of more than a million . The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258 , resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires . With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state ( formerly the British Mandate of Mesopotamia ) in 1932 , Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arabic culture , with a population variously estimated at 6 or over 7 million . [ note 1 ] In contemporary times , the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage , most recently due to the United States-led 2003 invasion of Iraq , and the subsequent Iraq War that lasted until December 2011 . In recent years , the city has been frequently subjected to insurgency attacks . The war had resulted in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts as well . As of 2018 [ update ] , Baghdad was listed as one of the least hospitable places in the world to live , ranked by Mercer as the worst major city for quality of life in the world .",
