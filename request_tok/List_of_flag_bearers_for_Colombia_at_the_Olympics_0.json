The sport was originally created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano ( \u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce ) as a physical , mental , and moral pedagogy in Japan . Judo 's most prominent feature is its competitive element , where the objective is to either throw or take down an opponent to the ground , immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin , or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke . Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo , but only in pre-arranged forms ( kata , \u5f62 ) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ( randori , \u4e71\u53d6\u308a ) . A judo practitioner is called a judoka . The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from kory\u016b ( \u53e4\u6d41 , traditional schools ) . Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world , such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Krav Maga and Sambo .",

  "/wiki/Cycling": "Cycling , also called biking or bicycling , is the use of bicycles for transport , recreation , exercise or sport . People engaged in cycling are referred to as cyclists , bikers , or less commonly , as bicyclists . Apart from two-wheeled bicycles , cycling also includes the riding of unicycles , tricycles , quadracycles , recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles ( HPVs ) . Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide . They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world . Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances . Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles , including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling , easier parking , increased maneuverability , and access to roads , bike paths and rural trails . Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels , less air or noise pollution , and much reduced traffic congestion . These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large ( negligible damage to roads , less road area required ) . By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses , transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve . In addition , cycling provides a variety of health benefits . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers , heart disease , and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles .",

  "/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting": "Olympic weightlifting , or Olympic-style weightlifting , often simply referred to as weightlifting , is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk . The snatch is a wide-grip , one-move lift . The clean and jerk is a close-grip , two-move lift . Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category . Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors . A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an incomplete entry for the competition . The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form . In comparison with other strength sports , which test limit strength ( with or without lifting aids ) , weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits ( explosive strength ) ; the lifts are therefore executed faster - and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other strength movements . The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting , and in particular their component lifts ( e.g . squats , deadlifts , cleans ) , are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength .",

  "/wiki/Swimming_(sport)": "Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one 's entire body to move through water . The sport takes place in pools or open water ( e.g. , in a sea or lake ) . Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports , with varied distance events in butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke , freestyle , and individual medley . In addition to these individual events , four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay . A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke , ordered as backstroke , breaststroke , butterfly and freestyle . Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques ; in competition , there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke . There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits , caps , jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions . Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport , such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees , there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport .",

  "/wiki/Racewalking": "Racewalking , or race walking , is a long-distance discipline within the sport of athletics . Although it is a foot race , it is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times . This is assessed by race judges . Typically held on either roads or on running tracks , common distances range from 3,000 metres ( 1.9 mi ) up to 100 kilometres ( 62.1 mi ) . There are two racewalking distances contested at the Summer Olympics : the 20 kilometres race walk ( men and women ) and 50 kilometres race walk ( men only ) . Both are held as road events . The biennial World Athletics Championships also features these three events , in addition to a 50 km walk for women . The IAAF World Race Walking Cup , first held in 1961 , is a stand-alone global competition for the discipline and it has 10 kilometres race walks for junior athletes , in addition to the Olympic-standard events . The IAAF World Indoor Championships featured 5000 m and 3000 m race walk variations , but these were discontinued after 1993 . Top level athletics championships and games typically feature 20 km racewalking events . The sport emerged from a British culture of long-distance competitive walking known as pedestrianism , which began to develop the ruleset that is the basis of the modern discipline around the mid-19th century . Since the mid-20th century onwards , Russian and Chinese athletes have been among the most successful on the global stage , with Europe and parts of Latin America producing most of the remaining top level walkers .",

The 1972 Summer Olympics were the second Summer Olympics to be held in Germany , after the 1936 Games in Berlin , which had taken place under the Nazi regime . The West German Government had been eager to have the Munich Olympics present a democratic and optimistic Germany to the world , as shown by the Games ' official motto , Die Heiteren Spiele , or the cheerful Games . The logo of the Games was a blue solar logo ( the Bright Sun ) by Otl Aicher , the designer and director of the visual conception commission . The Olympic mascot , the dachshund Waldi , was the first officially named Olympic mascot . The Olympic Fanfare was composed by Herbert Rehbein .

  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people , usually wearing protective gloves , throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring . Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games - it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing , disqualification of an opponent , or resignation of an opponent . When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing , the judges ' scorecards determine the victor . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , professional bouts are considered a draw . In Olympic boxing , because a winner must be declared , judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria . While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history , the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC . The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece , where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules .",

A fourth discipline , singlestick , appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped after that , and is not a part of modern fencing . Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics . Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship , the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century , with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial art of classical fencing , and the French school later refining the Italian system . There are three forms of modern fencing , each of which uses a different kind of weapon and has different rules ; thus the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes : foil , \u00e9p\u00e9e , and sabre .

The games were the first to be televised , and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries . Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $ 7 million . Her film , titled Olympia , pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports . Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism , and the official Nazi party paper , the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games . German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods , although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club , Hakoah Vienna , did take part . Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime .
