Initially launched as an Arabic news and current-affairs satellite TV channel , Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets , including the Internet and specialty television channels in multiple languages . Al Jazeera Media Network is a major global news organization , with 80 bureaus around the world . The original Al Jazeera Arabic channel 's willingness to broadcast dissenting views , for example on call-in shows , created controversies in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf . The station gained worldwide attention following the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan , when its office there was the only channel to cover the war live . Al Jazeera Media Network is owned by the government of Qatar . Al Jazeera Media Network has stated that they are editorially independent from the government of Qatar as the network is funded through loans and grants rather than government subsidies . Critics have accused Al Jazeera of being a propaganda outlet for the Qatari government . The network is sometimes perceived to have mainly Islamist perspectives , promoting the Muslim Brotherhood , and having a pro-Sunni and an anti-Shia bias in its reporting of regional issues . However , Al Jazeera insists it covers all sides of a debate ; it says it presents Israel 's view , Iran 's view and even aired videos released by Osama bin Laden . In June 2017 , the Saudi , Emirati , Bahraini , and Egyptian governments demanded the closure of the news station as one of thirteen demands made to Qatar during the 2017 Qatar Crisis . Other media networks have spoken out in support of the network .",

The conflict resulted in between 1,166 and 1,417 Palestinian and 13 Israeli deaths ( 4 from friendly fire ) . Israel 's stated goal was to stop indiscriminate Palestinian rocket fire into Israel and weapons smuggling into the Gaza strip . Hamas stated its rocket fire was in response to Israeli military actions , subsequent to what Hamas stated was a unilateral Israeli violation of a ceasefire several weeks earlier . Israeli forces attacked police stations , military targets including weapons caches and suspected rocket firing teams , as well as political and administrative institutions in the opening assault , striking in the densely populated cities of Gaza , Khan Yunis and Rafah . After hostilities broke out , Palestinian groups fired rockets in response to what they characterized as massacres . The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets as illegal under international law . An Israeli ground invasion began on 3 January . Infantry commanders were given an unprecedented level of access to coordinate with air , naval , artillery , intelligence , and combat engineering units during this second phase . Various new technologies and hardware were also introduced . On 5 January , the IDF began operating in the densely populated urban centers of Gaza . During the last week of the offensive ( from 12 January ) , Israel mostly hit targets it had damaged before and struck Palestinian rocket-launching units .",

The capital of the 115-island country , Victoria , lies 1,500 kilometres ( 932 mi ) east of mainland Africa . Other nearby island countries and territories include Comoros , Mayotte ( territory of France ) , Madagascar , R\u00e9union ( territory of France ) , and Mauritius to the south ; as well as the Maldives and Chagos Archipelago to the east . With a population of roughly 94,367 , it has the smallest population of any sovereign African country . Seychelles is a member of the United Nations , the African Union , the Southern African Development Community , and the Commonwealth of Nations . After proclaiming independence from the United Kingdom in 1976 , Seychelles has developed from a largely agricultural society to a market-based diversified economy , with agriculture being supplanted by rapidly rising service and public sectors as well as tourism . From 1976 until 2015 , nominal GDP output increased nearly sevenfold , and the purchasing power parity increased nearly sixteenfold . In the late 2010s , President Danny Faure and the National Assembly presented plans to encourage foreign investment in order to further upgrade these sectors . Today , Seychelles boasts the highest nominal per capita GDP in Africa , excluding the French regions . It is one of only a handful of countries in Africa with a high Human Development Index and is the first country in Africa with an HDI score exceeding 0.800 ( excluding French territorial possessions ) . It is also the only country in Africa which is classed as a high-income economy by the World Bank . Despite the country 's somewhat economic prosperity , poverty remains widespread , and there is a high level of economic inequality , one of the highest in the world , and unequal wealth distribution among the populace , with the upper and ruling class commanding a vast proportion of the country 's wealth .",
  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania .

It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts . Some of the famous works of medieval Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi , the works of Rumi , the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi , the Div\u0101n of Hafez , The Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur , and the miscellanea of Gulistan and Bustan by Saadi Shirazi .",

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic .

Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus .

  "/wiki/Turkish_language": "Turkish ( T\u00fcrk\u00e7e ( help\u00b7info ) ) , also referred to as Istanbul Turkish ( \u0130stanbul T\u00fcrk\u00e7esi ) , and sometimes known as Turkey Turkish ( T\u00fcrkiye T\u00fcrk\u00e7esi ) , is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages , with around ten to fifteen million native speakers in Southeast Europe ( mostly in East and Western Thrace ) and sixty to sixty-five million native speakers in Western Asia ( mostly in Anatolia ) . Outside Turkey , significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany , Austria , Bulgaria , North Macedonia , Northern Cyprus , Greece , the Caucasus , and other parts of Europe and Central Asia . Cyprus has requested that the European Union add Turkish as an official language , even though Turkey is not a member state . To the west , the influence of Ottoman Turkish - the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire - spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded . In 1928 , as one of Atat\u00fcrk 's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey , the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet . The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination . The basic word order of Turkish is subject-object-verb . Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender . The language makes usage of honorifics and has a strong T-V distinction which distinguishes varying levels of politeness , social distance , age , courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee . The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect .",
  "/wiki/Urdu": "Urdu ( /\u02c8\u028a\u0259rdu\u02d0/ ; Urdu : \u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u064f\u0648 , ALA-LC : Urd\u016b , [ \u02c8\u028ardu\u02d0 ] ( listen ) ) - also known as Lashkari ( \u0644\u0634\u06a9\u0631\u06cc , La\u0161kar\u012b , [ l\u0259\u0283k\u0259ri : ] ) - or Modern Standard Urdu is a Persianised standard register of the Hindustani language . Urdu is the official national language , and lingua franca , of Pakistan . In India , it is one of 22 constitutionally recognised official languages , having official status in the five states of Telangana , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , as well as the national capital territory of Delhi . As both registers are composed of the same Indo-Aryan vocabulary base , colloquial Urdu is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi , with the two registers being grouped together as Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu . With respect to literary vocabulary , however , formal Urdu draws heavily from Persian vocabulary and requires knowledge of some simple Persian grammatical structures , while formal Hindi heavily draws from Sanskrit for its formal and technical vocabulary . Later , Urdu became the official language of government in northern and northwest British India , along with English , from 1837 onwards in place of Persian , which had been used by various Indo-Islamic empires as their language of government . Religious , social , and political factors arose during the colonial period that advocated for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi , leading to the Hindi-Urdu controversy . According to Nationalencyklopedin 's 2010 estimates , Urdu is the 21st most spoken first language in the world , with approximately 66 million who speak it as their native language . According to Ethnologue 's 2018 estimates , Urdu , is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world , with 170 million total speakers , including those who speak it as a second language . If grouped along with Hindi , Hindustani would be the 3rd most spoken language in the world , with approximately 329.1 million native speakers , and 697.4 million total speakers of both Urdu and Hindi .",

  "/wiki/WikiTribune": "WikiTribune ( stylized as WikiTRIBUNE ) was a news wiki where volunteers wrote and curated articles about widely publicised news by proofreading , fact-checking , suggesting possible changes , and adding sources from other , usually long established outlets . Jimmy Wales , co-founder of Wikipedia , announced the site in April 2017 as a for-profit site , not affiliated with Wikipedia or its support organisation , the Wikimedia Foundation . Until October 2018 , WikiTribune employed journalists with established backgrounds in the profession who researched , syndicated , and reported news . Initial crowdfunding for the site was completed in May 2017 . In August 2017 , Peter Bale was named as the first editor of the site on their temporary publishing platform at Medium.com . This was followed by a teaser article posted to Medium in September . The site opened to the public in October 2017 , with a focus on political , business and economic news , bolstered by weekly in-depth articles . A year later , WikiTribune laid off its team of reporters and editors , after which volunteers could publish articles without having them checked by professionals . Despite the best efforts of staff , the overall structure and design did n't let the community genuinely flourish , said founder Jimmy Wales . We did n't get very much work done .

  "/wiki/Spanish_language": "Spanish ( /\u02c8sp\u00e6n\u026a\u0283/ ( listen ) ; espa\u00f1ol ( help\u00b7info ) ) , or Castilian ( /k\u00e6\u02c8st\u026ali\u0259n/ ( listen ) , castellano ( help\u00b7info ) ) , is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula and today has over 483 million native speakers , mainly in Spain and the Americas . It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations ."
