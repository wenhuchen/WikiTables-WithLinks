  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/List_of_Vice_Presidents_of_the_United_States": "There have been 48 vice presidents of the United States since the office came into existence in 1789 . Originally , the vice president was the person who received the second most votes for president in the Electoral College . However , in the election of 1800 a tie in the electoral college between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr led to the selection of the president by the House of Representatives . To prevent such an event from happening again , the Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution , creating the current system where electors cast a separate ballot for the vice presidency . The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession and assumes that presidency if the president dies , resigns , or is impeached and removed from office . Nine vice presidents have ascended to the presidency in this way : eight ( John Tyler , Millard Fillmore , Andrew Johnson , Chester A. Arthur , Theodore Roosevelt , Calvin Coolidge , Harry S. Truman , and Lyndon B. Johnson ) through the president 's death and one ( Gerald Ford ) through the president 's resignation . In addition , the vice president serves as the president of the Senate and may choose to cast a tie-breaking vote on decisions made by the Senate . Vice presidents have exercised this latter power to varying extents over the years . Prior to adoption of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967 , an intra-term vacancy in the office of the vice president could not be filled until the next post-election inauguration . Several such vacancies occurred - seven vice presidents died , one resigned and eight succeeded to the presidency . This amendment allowed for a vacancy to be filled through appointment by the president and confirmation by both chambers of the Congress . Since its ratification , the vice presidency has been vacant twice ( both in the context of scandals surrounding the Nixon administration ) and was filled both times through this process , namely in 1973 following Spiro Agnew 's resignation , and again in 1974 after Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency .",
  "/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States": "The vice president of the United States is the second-highest officer in the executive branch of the U.S. federal government , after the president of the United States , and ranks first in the presidential line of succession . The vice president is also an officer in the legislative branch , as president of the Senate . In this capacity , the vice president is empowered to preside over Senate deliberations , but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote . The vice president also presides over joint sessions of Congress . The vice president is indirectly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College . Section 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment , ratified in 1967 , created a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession , establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress . Prior to 1967 , in the event a vice president succeeded to the presidency , died , or resigned from office , the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began . The vice president is also a statutory member of the National Security Council , and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution . The Office of the Vice President assists and organises the vice president 's official functions . The role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 constitutional Convention . Especially over the past 100 years , the vice presidency has evolved into a position of domestic and foreign policy political power , and is now widely seen as an integral part of a president 's administration . As the vice president 's role within the executive branch has expanded , his role within the legislative branch has contracted ; for example , he presides over the Senate only infrequently .",

The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",

  "/wiki/Rain_porch": "A rain porch , also commonly known as a Carolina porch , is a type of indigenous porch form found in the Southeastern United States . Some architectural scholars believe it to have originated along the coast of the Carolinas , hence the colloquial name . The defining characteristic of the rain porch is a roof that extends far beyond the edge of the porch deck and is supported with freestanding supports that rise directly from ground level , rather than the floor of the porch deck . This protects the porch deck from exposure to the elements and also leaves it well shaded from the sun most of the time . Most commonly seen on historic folk houses , the rain porch also came to be adapted to the monumental porticoes of some Greek Revival mansions , such as Rosemount and Kirkwood . The overhang became especially exaggerated in some areas with copious amounts of rainfall , such as the Eastern Shore of Mobile Bay in Alabama .
