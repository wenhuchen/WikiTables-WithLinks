  "/wiki/Acid": "An Acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a proton ( hydrogen ion H+ ) ( a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) . The first category of acids are the proton donors , or Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Br\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Br\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ . Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/ac\u0113re meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic . Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) .",
  "/wiki/Chemical_base": "In chemistry , bases are substances that , in aqueous solution , release hydroxide ( OH\u2212 ) ions , are slippery to the touch , can taste bitter if an alkali , change the color of indicators ( e.g. , turn red litmus paper blue ) , react with acids to form salts , promote certain chemical reactions ( base catalysis ) , accept protons from any proton donor or contain completely or partially displaceable OH\u2212 ions . Examples of bases are the hydroxides of the alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals ( NaOH , Ca ( OH ) 2 , etc . - see alkali hydroxide and alkaline earth hydroxide ) . In water , by altering the autoionization equilibrium , bases yield solutions in which the hydrogen ion activity is lower than it is in pure water , i.e. , the water has a pH higher than 7.0 at standard conditions . A soluble base is called an alkali if it contains and releases OH\u2212 ions quantitatively . However , it is important to realize that basicity is not the same as alkalinity . Metal oxides , hydroxides , and especially alkoxides are basic , and conjugate bases of weak acids are weak bases . Bases can be thought of as the chemical opposite of acids . However , some strong acids are able to act as bases . Bases and acids are seen as opposites because the effect of an acid is to increase the hydronium ( H3O+ ) concentration in water , whereas bases reduce this concentration . A reaction between an acid and a base is called neutralization . In a neutralization reaction , an aqueous solution of a base reacts with an aqueous solution of an acid to produce a solution of water and salt in which the salt separates into its component ions .",

It is found in many gums such as gum arabic ( c. 18% ) , xanthan , and Kombucha tea and is important for the metabolism of microorganisms , plants and animals .",
  "/wiki/Glycine_conjugation": "Drug metabolism is the metabolic breakdown of drugs by living organisms , usually through specialized enzymatic systems . More generally , xenobiotic metabolism ( from the Greek xenos stranger and biotic related to living beings ) is the set of metabolic pathways that modify the chemical structure of xenobiotics , which are compounds foreign to an organism 's normal biochemistry , such as any drug or poison . These pathways are a form of biotransformation present in all major groups of organisms , and are considered to be of ancient origin . These reactions often act to detoxify poisonous compounds ( although in some cases the intermediates in xenobiotic metabolism can themselves cause toxic effects ) . The study of drug metabolism is called pharmacokinetics . The metabolism of pharmaceutical drugs is an important aspect of pharmacology and medicine . For example , the rate of metabolism determines the duration and intensity of a drug 's pharmacologic action . Drug metabolism also affects multidrug resistance in infectious diseases and in chemotherapy for cancer , and the actions of some drugs as substrates or inhibitors of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are a common reason for hazardous drug interactions . These pathways are also important in environmental science , with the xenobiotic metabolism of microorganisms determining whether a pollutant will be broken down during bioremediation , or persist in the environment . The enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism , particularly the glutathione S-transferases are also important in agriculture , since they may produce resistance to pesticides and herbicides . Drug metabolism is divided into three phases . In phase I , enzymes such as cytochrome P450 oxidases introduce reactive or polar groups into xenobiotics .",

  "/wiki/Penicillin": "Penicillin ( PCN or pen ) is a group of antibiotics , derived originally from common moulds known as Penicillium moulds ; which includes penicillin G ( intravenous use ) , penicillin V ( use by mouth ) , procaine penicillin , and benzathine penicillin ( intramuscular use ) . Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci . They are still widely used today , though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use . About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin ; however , up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic . Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03% . Those who are allergic to penicillin are most often given cephalosporin C because of its functional groups . All penicillins are \u03b2-lactam antibiotics , which are some of the most powerful and successful achievements in modern science . Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming . People began using it to treat infections in 1942 . There are several enhanced penicillin families which are effective against additional bacteria ; these include the antistaphylococcal penicillins , aminopenicillins and the antipseudomonal penicillins . They are derived from Penicillium fungi .",
  "/wiki/Probenecid": "Probenecid , also sold under the brand name Probalan , is a medication that increases uric acid excretion in the urine . It is primarily used in treating gout and hyperuricemia . Probenecid was developed as an alternative to caronamide to competitively inhibit renal excretion of some drugs , thereby increasing their plasma concentration and prolonging their effects .",
  "/wiki/Thiazide": "Thiazide ( /\u02c8\u03b8a\u026a\u0259za\u026ad/ ) refers to both a class of sulfur-containing organic molecules and a class of diuretics based on the chemical structure of benzothiadiazine . The thiazide drug class was discovered and developed at Merck and Co. in the 1950s . The first approved drug of this class , chlorothiazide , was marketed under the trade name Diuril beginning in 1958 . In most countries , thiazides are the least expensive antihypertensive drugs available . Thiazide organic molecules are bi-cyclic structures that contain adjacent sulfur and nitrogen atoms on one ring . Confusion sometimes occurs because thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are referred to as thiazides . These molecules do not have the thiazide chemical structure . When used this way , thiazide refers to a drug which acts at the thiazide receptor . The thiazide receptor is a sodium-chloride transporter that pulls NaCl from the lumen in the distal convoluted tubule . Thiazide diuretics cause the body to release NaCl and water lumen , and increase the amount of urine made each day . An example of a molecule that is chemically a thiazide but is not used as a diuretic is methylchloroisothiazolinone . Methylchloroisothiazolinone is used as an antimicrobial in cosmetics .",

  "/wiki/Dopamine": "Dopamine ( DA , a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine ) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families . It functions both as a hormone and a neurotransmitter , and plays several important roles in the brain and body . It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA , which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys . Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals . In the brain , dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter - a chemical released by neurons ( nerve cells ) to send signals to other nerve cells . The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways , one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior . The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain , [ failed verification ] and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release . Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones . These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory . In popular culture and media , dopamine is usually seen as the main chemical of pleasure , but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confers motivational salience ; in other words , dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence ( i.e. , the desirability or aversiveness ) of an outcome , which in turn propels the organism 's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome . Outside the central nervous system , dopamine functions primarily as a local paracrine messenger . In blood vessels , it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator ( at normal concentrations ) ; in the kidneys , it increases sodium excretion and urine output ; in the pancreas , it reduces insulin production ; in the digestive system , it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa ; and in the immune system , it reduces the activity of lymphocytes .",
  "/wiki/Histamine": "Histamine is an organic nitrogenous compound involved in local immune responses , as well as regulating physiological function in the gut and acting as a neurotransmitter for the brain , spinal cord , and uterus . Histamine is involved in the inflammatory response and has a central role as a mediator of itching . As part of an immune response to foreign pathogens , histamine is produced by basophils and by mast cells found in nearby connective tissues . Histamine increases the permeability of the capillaries to white blood cells and some proteins , to allow them to engage pathogens in the infected tissues . It consists of an imidazole ring attached to an ethylamine chain ; under physiological conditions , the amino group of the side-chain is protonated .",

  "/wiki/Morphine": "Morphine is a pain medication of the opiate family which is found naturally in a number of plants and animals , including humans . It acts directly on the central nervous system ( CNS ) to decrease the feeling of pain . It can be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain . It is frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labor . It can be given by mouth , by injection into a muscle , by injection under the skin , intravenously , injection into the space around the spinal cord , or rectally . Maximum effect is reached after about 20 minutes when given intravenously and after 60 minutes when given by mouth , while duration of effect is 3-7 hours . Long-acting formulations also exist . Potentially serious side effects include decreased respiratory effort and low blood pressure . Morphine is addictive and prone to abuse . If the dose is reduced after long-term use , opioid withdrawal symptoms may occur . Common side effects include drowsiness , vomiting , and constipation . Caution is advised when used during pregnancy or breast feeding , as morphine may affect the baby .",
  "/wiki/Pethidine": "Pethidine , also known as meperidine and sold under the brand name Demerol among others , is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class . Synthesized in 1938 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb , its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben , Germany . Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines ( piminodine , anileridine and others ) , the prodines ( alphaprodine , MPPP , etc . ) , bemidones ( ketobemidone , etc . ) and others more distant , including diphenoxylate and analogues . Pethidine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain , and is delivered as a hydrochloride salt in tablets , as a syrup , or by intramuscular , subcutaneous , or intravenous injection . For much of the 20th century , pethidine was the opioid of choice for many physicians ; in 1975 , 60% of doctors prescribed it for acute pain and 22% for chronic severe pain . It was patented in 1937 and approved for medical use in 1943 . Compared with morphine , pethidine was thought to be safer , carry a lower risk of addiction , and to be superior in treating the pain associated with biliary spasm or renal colic due to its putative anticholinergic effects . These were later discovered to be all myths , as it carries an equal risk of addiction , possesses no advantageous effects on biliary spasm or renal colic compared to other opioids , and due to its toxic metabolite norpethidine is more toxic than other opioids - especially during long-term use . The norpethidine metabolite was found to have serotonergic effects , so pethidine could , unlike most opioids , contribute to serotonin syndrome .",

  "/wiki/Serotonin": "Serotonin ( /\u02ccs\u025br\u0259\u02c8to\u028an\u026an , \u02ccs\u026a\u0259r\u0259-/ ) or 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) is a monoamine neurotransmitter . It has a popular image as a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness , though its actual biological function is complex and multifaceted , modulating cognition , reward , learning , memory , and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction . Biochemically , the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan , via the ( rate-limiting ) hydroxylation of the 5 position on the ring ( forming the intermediate 5-hydroxytryptophan ) , and then decarboxylation to produce serotonin . Serotonin is primarily found in the enteric nervous system located in the gastrointestinal tract ( GI tract ) . However , it is also produced in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , specifically in the Raphe nuclei located in the brainstem . Additionally , serotonin is stored in blood platelets and is released during agitation and vasoconstriction , where it then acts as an agonist to other platelets . Approximately 90% of the human body 's total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract , where it regulates intestinal movements . The serotonin is secreted luminally and basolaterally , which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation , which gives increased stimulation of myenteric neurons and gastrointestinal motility . The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS , where it has various functions . These include the regulation of mood , appetite , and sleep . Serotonin also has some cognitive functions , including memory and learning . Several classes of antidepressants , such as the SSRIs and the SNRIs among others , interfere with the normal reabsorption of serotonin after it is done with the transmission of the signal , therefore augmenting the neurotransmitter levels in the synapses ."
