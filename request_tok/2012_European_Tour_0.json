The rankings are based on a player 's position in individual tournaments ( i.e . not pairs or team events ) over a rolling two-year period . New rankings are produced each week . During 2018 , nearly 400 tournaments on 20 tours were covered by the ranking system . All players competing in these tournaments are included in the rankings .

In 2009 , it was announced that the Africa Open would be included on the 2010 European Tour schedule . It was the third event of the four tournament South African swing of the tour , held after the Alfred Dunhill Championship and the South African Open , and the week before the Joburg Open .

  "/wiki/South_Africa": "South Africa , officially the Republic of South Africa ( RSA ) , is the southernmost country in Africa . It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho . South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

  "/wiki/Sunshine_Tour": "The Sunshine Tour is a men 's professional golf tour based in Southern Africa . For much of its early history it was known either as the South African Tour or Sunshine Circuit ; through sponsorship deals , it has also been known as the Vodacom Tour and the FNB Tour . For the 2000-01 season the tour rebranded itself as the Sunshine Tour in an attempt to broaden its appeal . A large majority of the tour events are still staged in South Africa . The tour is one of the six leading men 's tours which before 2009 made up the membership of the International Federation of PGA Tours , but it offers much less prize money than some of the leading tours , and leading Southern African golfers traditionally prefer to play on the PGA Tour or the European Tour if they can qualify to do so , typically returning to play in Sunshine Tour events a couple of times a year . Most of the tour 's leading official money events , including the South African Open , are co-sanctioned with the European Tour to attract stronger fields . The 2015 season included 27 official money events . The co-sanctioned events had purses ranging from \u20ac1 million to $ 6.5 million , while the other 21 events had purses designated in South African Rand and ranging from 650,000 rand to 4.5 million rand . There was at least one tournament every month of the year except July , but the main events took place in the South African summer from November to February . The tour has been open to non-White players since 1991 . Five black golfers have won events : South Africa 's John Mashego at the 1991 Bushveld Classic ; South Africa 's Lindani Ndwandwe at the 2001 Western Cape Classic and 2009 Highveld Classic ; Zimbabwe 's Tongoona Charamba at the 2006 SAA Pro-Am Invitational and 2008 MTC Namibia PGA Championship ; Zambia 's Madalitso Muthiya at the 2016 Vodacom Origins of Golf ( Wild Coast ) ; and South Africa 's Toto Thimba Jr. at the 2019 KCB Karen Masters .

The sovereign constitutional monarchy is a federation of seven emirates consisting of Abu Dhabi ( which serves as the capital ) , Ajman , Dubai , Fujairah , Ras Al Khaimah , Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain . Their boundaries are complex , with numerous enclaves within the various emirates . Each emirate is governed by a ruler ; together , they jointly form the Federal Supreme Council . One of the rulers serves as the President of the United Arab Emirates . In 2013 , the UAE 's population was 9.2 million , of which 1.4 million are Emirati citizens and 7.8 million are expatriates . Human occupation of the present UAE has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 125,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-1 site in Mleiha , Sharjah . Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area .",

Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",

An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",
