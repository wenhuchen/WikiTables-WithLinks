Designed by Joseph Stanislaus Hansom , it was founded on 26 October 1881 and opened on 16 August 1882 . Its tall west fa\u00e7ade faces a narrow road , and the building goes back a long way : the interior feels open and spacious , although there are side chapels . The five-bay nave was extended by W.C. Mangan in 1955-57 ; he also added transepts , a Lady chapel and other rooms . The Early English Gothic Revival church is mostly of yellow brick and stone . Some windows are in the more intricate Perpendicular style . It was listed in June 2015",

  "intro": "The district of Arun, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex, has nearly 90 current and former places of worship. As of 2020, 68 active churches and chapels serve the dense urban development on the English Channel coast and the mostly rural hinterland of ancient towns and villages; a further 21 former places of worship still stand but are no longer in religious use. Many churches, serving a wide variety of Christian denominations, are located in the main towns of Littlehampton and Bognor Regis - Victorian seaside resorts which form the focal points of the nearly continuous urban area around the River Arun estuary. Surrounding villages, and their ancient and modern churches, have been absorbed by the 20th-century growth of these towns. Further north, the important hilltop town of Arundel has a Roman Catholic cathedral and a long established Anglican church, and was a centre of Nonconformist worship. English Heritage has awarded listed status to nearly 40 current and former church buildings in Arun. A building is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status. Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of exceptional interest; Grade II* is used for particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of special interest. As of February 2001, there were 23 Grade I-listed buildings, 24 with Grade II* status and 913 Grade II-listed buildings in Arun."
