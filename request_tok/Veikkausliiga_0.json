In the late 1990s the objective was promotion but year after year they failed . In the beginning of the 21st century FC Honka almost went bankrupt but was saved at the last moment . In early 2005 the club was taken over by Jouko Pakarinen and Jouko Harjunp\u00e4\u00e4 , who had a plan to turn FC Honka from underachievers to a UEFA Champions League candidate . In the first year of their take-over of FC Honka , the management succeeded in assembling a squad which won the First Division ( Ykk\u00f6nen ) with ease and also made the semi-finals of the Finnish Cup where they eventually lost 1-0 to FC Haka . FC Honka was able to fight for top positions instantly , but narrowly missed the top three in their first two seasons .",
