  "/wiki/Bruck_an_der_Leitha": "Bruck an der Leitha ( Bridge on the Leitha ) is a city in Lower Austria , Austria at the border to the Burgenland , which is marked by the Leitha river . In and around Bruck parts of neolithic tools were found , which makes it likely that there was a settlement there at that time . In Roman time , there was the crossing of two major roads , one of them being the Amber Road , the other a link to the Via Militaris . The important Roman army camp Carnuntum was located only ten miles northeast of Bruck at the Amber Road . In Bruck a Roman fortification is said to have been at the place of Schloss Prugg ( castle of Duke Harrach ) , of which one part still is named Roman Tower ( though being built in the Middle Ages ) . After the end of the Roman Empire , the first traces of new settlement date from around 900 . Graves from this time show Hungarian and later Francian/Bavarian influence . In 1074 the settlement is first documented as Aschirichesprucca and elevated to the status of a city in 1239 . During the 13th century Bruck was rebuilt according to a rectangular street-scheme north-east of the old settlement . Though quite strongly fortified since , Bruck never played an important role in a military conflict . In the long period of wars with the Turkish Empire the fortifications were already outdated , so Bruck did not even try to resist Turkish troops when they approached Vienna in 1529 and 1683 ( Siege of Vienna ) . Therefore , Bruck was not destroyed ( unlike other towns like Hainburg ) .",
