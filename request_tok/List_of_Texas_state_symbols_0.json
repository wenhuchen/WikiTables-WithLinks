  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_mottos": "All of the United States ' 50 states have a state motto , as do the District of Columbia , and 3 U.S. territories . A motto is a phrase intended to formally describe the general motivation or intention of an organization . State mottos can sometimes be found on state seals or state flags . Some states have officially designated a state motto by an act of the state legislature , whereas other states have the motto only as an element of their seals . The motto of the United States itself is In God We Trust , proclaimed by Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on July 30 , 1956 . The motto E Pluribus Unum ( Latin for One from many ) was approved for use on the Great Seal of the United States in 1782 , but was never adopted as the national motto through legislative action . South Carolina has two official mottos , both of which are in Latin . Kentucky , North Dakota , and Vermont also have two mottos , one in Latin and the other in English . All other states and territories have only one motto , except for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands , which do not have any mottos . English and Latin are the most-used languages for state mottos , each used by 25 states and territories . Seven states and territories use another language , of which each language is only used once . Eight states and two territories have their mottos on their state quarter ; thirty-eight states and four territories have their mottos on their state seals .",

  "/wiki/Texas_bluebonnet": "Lupinus texensis , the Texas bluebonnet or Texas lupine is a species of lupine endemic to Texas , plus the Mexican states of Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas . With other related species of lupines also called bluebonnets , it is the state flower of Texas . It is an annual which begins its life as a small , gravel-like seed . The seed has a hard seed coat that must be penetrated by wind , rain , and weather over the course of a few months ( but sometimes several years ) . In the fall , the bluebonnets emerge as small seedings with two cotyledons , and later a rosette of leaves that are palmately compound , with five to seven leaflets 3-10 cm long , green with a faint white edge and hair . Growth continues over the mild winter , and then in the spring takes off , rapidly grow larger , before sending up a 20- to 50-cm-tall plume of blue flowers ( with bits of white and occasionally a tinge of pinkish-red ) . The scent of these blossoms has been diversely described ; many people say they give off no scent at all , while a few have described the scent as 'sickly sweet ' . It has been found in the wild with isolated mutations in other colors , most notably all-white flowers , pink , and the maroon 'Alamo Fire ' variation . These mutations have since been selectively bred to produce different color strains that are available commercially . Texas recognizes all native lupine species occurring in the state as the official state flower . That fact leads to other species such as L. subcarnosus and L. havardii also being referred to as bluebonnets , but distinctions are seen among the species that differentiate them from L. texensis .",

  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_dogs": "Thirteen states of the United States have designated an official state dog breed . Maryland was the first state to name a dog breed as a state symbol , naming the Chesapeake Bay Retriever in 1964 . Pennsylvania followed the year after , naming the Great Dane as its official breed . Dog breeds are mostly affiliated with the states that they originated in . North Carolina chose the Plott Hound as it was the only dog breed indigenous to the state . Other official state dogs also are indigenous to their state , including the Boston Terrier ( Massachusetts ) and the Alaskan Malamute ( Alaska ) . Pennsylvania selected the Great Dane not because of its origin , but because it was introduced by early settlers in the state to be used as a hunting and working dog ; it was chosen over the Beagle , which was also proposed around the same time . Two of the more recent successful campaigns to name a state dog have been started by schoolchildren . In 2007 , Alaskan kindergarten student Paige Hill 's idea created the campaign for the Alaskan Malamute which would convince Representative Berta Gardner to support the bill in 2009 , with it becoming law in 2010 . Elementary school students from Bedford , New Hampshire won their campaign for the Chinook to be accepted as a symbol of their state in 2010 . There have been a variety of campaigns in other states to select a state dog . Georgia was undecided about choosing a state dog in 1991 , with an attempt to make the Golden Retriever the official dog failing after a vote in the Georgia State Senate ; an opposing campaign promoted the Bulldog , the mascot of the University of Georgia .",

In June 2005 , Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Blue Lacy as the official State Dog Breed of Texas . As expected , the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas . However , as the breed becomes more well recognized , there are breeding populations being established across the United States , Canada , and most recently in Europe ."
