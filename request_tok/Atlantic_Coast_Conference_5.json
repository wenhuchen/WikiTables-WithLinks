  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",
  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports . The National Basketball Association ( NBA ) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity , salaries , talent , and level of competition . Outside North America , the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas .",
  "/wiki/Cross_country_running": "Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass . Sometimes the runners are referred to as harriers . The course , typically 4-12 kilometres ( 2.5-7.5 mi ) long , may include surfaces of grass , and earth , pass through woodlands and open country , and include hills , flat ground and sometimes gravel road . It is both an individual and a team sport ; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method . Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country , which usually takes place during autumn and winter , and can include weather conditions of rain , sleet , snow or hail , and a wide range of temperatures . Cross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of athletics , and is a natural terrain version of long-distance track and road running . Although open-air running competitions are pre-historic , the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain . The English championship became the first national competition in 1876 and the International Cross Country Championships was held for the first time in 1903 . Since 1973 the foremost elite competition has been the IAAF World Cross Country Championships .",
  "/wiki/Fencing": "Fencing is a group of three related combat sports . The three disciplines in modern fencing are the foil , the \u00e9p\u00e9e , and the sabre ( also saber ) ; winning points are made through the weapon 's contact with an opponent . A fourth discipline , singlestick , appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped after that , and is not a part of modern fencing . Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics . Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship , the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century , with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial art of classical fencing , and the French school later refining the Italian system . There are three forms of modern fencing , each of which uses a different kind of weapon and has different rules ; thus the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes : foil , \u00e9p\u00e9e , and sabre . Most competitive fencers choose to specialize in one weapon only . Competitive fencing is one of the five activities which have been featured in every modern Olympic Games , the other four being athletics , cycling , swimming , and gymnastics .",
  "/wiki/Field_hockey": "Field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family . The game can be played on grass , watered turf , artificial turf or synthetic field , as well as an indoor boarded surface . Each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper . Players commonly use sticks made out of wood , carbon fibre , fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities ( with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break ) to hit a round , hard , plastic hockey ball . The length of the hockey stick is based on the player 's individual height , the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip , taller players typically have taller sticks . The sticks have a round side and a flat side only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used , if the other side is used it results in a foul . Goalies often have a different kind of stick , however they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick . The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick , this is to give them more surface area to save the ball . The uniform consists of shin guards , shoes , shorts or a skirt , a mouthguard and a jersey . Today , the game is played globally , mainly in parts of Western Europe , South Asia , Southern Africa , Australia , New Zealand , Argentina , and parts of the United States ( primarily New England and the Mid-Atlantic states ) . Known simply as hockey in many territories , the term field hockey is used primarily in Canada and the United States where ice hockey is more popular . In Sweden , the term landhockey is used and to some degree also in Norway where it is governed by Norway 's Bandy Association .",
  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",
  "/wiki/Golf": "Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible . Golf , unlike most ball games , can not and does not utilize a standardized playing area , and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game . The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes , though recreational courses can be smaller , often having nine holes . Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from , and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1\u20444 inches ( 11 cm ) in diameter . There are other standard forms of terrain in between , such as the fairway , rough ( long grass ) , bunkers ( or sand traps ) , and various hazards ( water , rocks ) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement . Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual , known as stroke play , or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team , known as match play . Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels , but most especially at the elite level . The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland . The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764 . Golf 's first major , and the world 's oldest tournament in existence , is The Open Championship , also known as the British Open , which was first played in 1860 in Ayrshire , Scotland . This is one of the four major championships in men 's professional golf , the other three being played in the United States : The Masters , the U.S. Open , and the PGA Championship .",
  "/wiki/Lacrosse": "Lacrosse is a team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball . It is the oldest organized sport in North America , with its origins in a tribal game played by eastern Woodlands indigenous peoples and by some Plains Indians tribes in what is now the United States of America and Canada . The game was extensively modified reducing the violence by European colonizers to create its current collegiate and professional form . The modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations . The organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men , the Women 's Lacrosse World Cup , the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse , and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men and women . Each is held every four years . Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games , 1904 and 1908 . It was also held as a demonstration event at the 1928 , 1932 , and 1948 Summer Olympics . Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry , pass , catch , and shoot the ball into the goal . The sport has four versions that have different sticks , fields , rules and equipment : field lacrosse , women 's lacrosse , box lacrosse and intercrosse . The men 's games , field lacrosse ( outdoor ) and box lacrosse ( indoor ) , are contact sports and all players wear protective gear : helmet , gloves , shoulder pads , and elbow pads . The women 's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact .",
  "/wiki/Rowing_(sport)": "Rowing , sometimes referred to as crew in the United States , is a sport whose origins reach back to Ancient Egyptian times . It involves propelling a boat ( racing shell ) on water using oars . By pushing against the water with an oar , a force is generated to move the boat . The sport can be either recreational for enjoyment or fitness , or competitive , when athletes race against each other in boats . There are a number of different boat classes in which athletes compete , ranging from an individual shell ( called a single scull ) to an eight-person shell with a coxswain ( called a coxed eight ) . Modern rowing as a competitive sport can be traced to the early 17th century when races ( regattas ) were held between professional watermen on the River Thames in London , United Kingdom . Often prizes were offered by the London Guilds and Livery Companies . Amateur competition began towards the end of the 18th century with the arrival of boat clubs at the British public schools of Eton College , Shrewsbury School , Durham School , and Westminster School . Similarly , clubs were formed at the University of Oxford , with a race held between Brasenose College and Jesus College in 1815 . At the University of Cambridge the first recorded races were in 1827 . Public rowing clubs were beginning at the same time ; in England Leander Club was founded in 1818 , in Germany Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club was founded in 1836 and in the United States Narragansett Boat Club was founded in 1838 and Detroit Boat Club was founded in 1839 . In 1843 , the first American college rowing club was formed at Yale University .",

While it is most widespread in the United States , it is also prominent in South Korea and Canada . The institutions typically hire full-time professional coaches and staff , although the student athletes are strictly amateur and are not paid . College soccer in the United States is sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , the sports regulatory body for major universities , and by the governing bodies for smaller universities and colleges . This sport is played on a rectangular field of the dimensions of about 64m ( meters ) - 70m sideline to sideline ( width ) , and 100m - 110m goal line to goal line ( length ) . College soccer teams play a variety of conference and non-conference games throughout the fall season , with the season culminating in the post-season tournament called the College Cup . The St. Louis University Billikens is the most successful men 's team , having won 10 College Cups while the North Carolina Tar Heels led by head coach Anson Dorrance is the most successful women 's college soccer team with 21 College Cup wins . The best men 's and women 's college soccer player each year is awarded the Hermann Trophy .

  "/wiki/Softball": "Softball is a game similar to baseball played with a larger ball ( 11 to 12 in . circumference ) on a field that has base lengths of 60 feet , a pitcher 's mound that ranges from 35-43 feet away from home plate , and a homerun fence that is 220 feet away from home plate . It was invented in 1887 in Chicago , Illinois , United States as an indoor game . The game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball . There is less time for the base runner to get to first while the opponent fields the ball ; yet , the fielder has less time to field the ball while the opponent is running down to first base . The name softball was given to the game in 1932 , because the ball used to be soft ; however , in modern-day usage , the balls are hard . A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World 's Fair spurred interest in the game . The Amateur Softball Association ( ASA ) of America ( founded 1933 ) is one of the largest governing bodies for the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships . Other national and regional governing bodies also exist , including the USSSA . The World Baseball Softball Confederation ( WBSC ) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries , including the United States and Canada ; before the WBSC was formed in 2013 , the International Softball Federation filled this role . Women 's fast pitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996 , but it and baseball were dropped from the 2012 program ; they are to be reinstated in 2020 . There are three types of softball .",

Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .",

Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team 's court under organized rules . It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964 . The complete set of rules are extensive , but play essentially proceeds as follows : a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally ' by serving the ball ( tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm ) , from behind the back boundary line of the court , over the net , and into the receiving team 's court . The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court . The team may touch the ball up to 3 times , but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively . Typically , the first two touches are used to set up for an attack , an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court . The rally continues , with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches , until either ( 1 ) : a team makes a kill , grounding the ball on the opponent 's court and winning the rally ; or ( 2 ) : a team commits a fault and loses the rally . The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally . A few of the most common faults include :",
