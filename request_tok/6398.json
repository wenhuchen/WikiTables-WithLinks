After completing his education , he became a teacher in 1930 ( at St Albans School ) . That same year , he won the British AAA championships over 880 yd ( 805 m ) , a title he would also claim in 1931 and 1932 . Also a winner at the inaugural British Empire Games , Hampson was one of the world 's leading runners in the 800 m and half-mile event . That made him one of the top favourites for the 800 m gold at the 1932 Olympics , held in Los Angeles . In the final , Hampson fought off Canadian Alex Wilson to break the tape in 1.49.7 , a new world record . He added a second Olympic medal with the British 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay team , which came second to the United States . Hampson ended his sports career later that year . Several years later , he left his teaching job to become an educator in the Royal Air Force , a job he kept until after World War II . In 1954 , Hampson moved to Stevenage , Hertfordshire , and joined the Stevenage Development Corporation as Social Relations Officer . He was a warden at the church of St Mary in the town , and after he died at the age of 57 , he was buried there .",
