Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . Havana is the largest city and capital ; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey . The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

  "/wiki/200_metres": "The 200 metres ( also spelt 200 meters ) is a sprint running event . On an outdoor race 400 m track , the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight , so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race . A slightly shorter race , called the stadion and run on a straight track , was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games . The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint . Similarly to other sprint distances , the 200 m begins from the starting blocks . When the sprinters adopt the 'set ' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles . This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster . In the United States and elsewhere , athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash ( 201.168 m ) instead of the 200 m ( 218.723 yards ) , though the distance is now obsolete . The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds , but other conversion methods exist . Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight , which was run on tracks that contained such a straight . Initially , when the International Amateur Athletic Association ( now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations ) started to ratify world records in 1912 , only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration . In 1951 , the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track .",

  "/wiki/400_metres": "The 400 metres , or 400 metre dash , is a sprinting event in track and field competitions . It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1964 for women . On a standard outdoor running track , it is one lap around the track . Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course . In many countries , athletes previously competed in the 440 yard dash ( 402.336 m ) - which is a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile ' - instead of the 400 m ( 437.445 yards ) , though this distance is now obsolete . Like other sprint disciplines , the 400 m involves the use of starting blocks . The runners take up position in the blocks on the 'ready ' command , adopt a more efficient starting posture which isometrically preloads their muscles on the 'set ' command , and stride forwards from the blocks upon hearing the starter 's pistol . The blocks allow the runners to begin more powerfully and thereby contribute to their overall sprint speed capability . Maximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event , but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap . While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event , there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400 metre athletes is open to debate . The current men 's world record is held by Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa , with a time of 43.03 seconds ; van Niekerk is also the Olympic champion . Steven Gardiner is the reigning World Champion .",

The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400-metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m.

The demands of the race are similar to that of the 800 metres , but with a slightly higher emphasis on aerobic endurance and a slightly lower sprint speed requirement . The 1500 metre race is predominantly aerobic , but anaerobic conditioning is also required . Each lap run during the world-record race run by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1998 in Rome , Italy averaged just under 55 seconds ( or under 13.8 seconds per 100 metres ) . 1,500 metres is three and three-quarter laps around a 400-metre track . During the 1970s and 1980s this race was dominated by British runners , along with an occasional Finn , American , or New Zealander , but through the 1990s many African runners began to win Olympic medals in this race , especially runners from Kenya , Morocco and Algeria . In the Modern Olympic Games , the men 's 1,500-metre race has been contested from the beginning , and at every Olympic Games since . The first winner , in 1896 , was Edwin Flack of Australia , who also won the first gold medal in the 800-metre race .
