  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

Bandy has also been influenced by the rules of association football : both games are normally played in halves of 45 minutes , there are 11 players on each team , and the fields in both games are about the same size . Bandy is played , like ice hockey , on ice but players use bowed sticks and a small ball , as in field hockey . A variant of bandy , rink bandy , is played to the same rules but on a field the size of an ice hockey rink , with ice hockey goal cages and with six players on each team , or five in USA Rink Bandy League . Traditional eleven-a-side bandy and rink bandy are recognized by the International Olympic Committee . More informal varieties also exist , like seven-a-side bandy with normally sized goal cages but without corner strokes . Those rules were applied at Davos Cup in 2016 . Rink bandy has in turn led to the creation of the sport rinkball . Bandy is also the predecessor of floorball , which was invented when people started playing with plastic bandy-shaped sticks and lightweight balls when running on the floors of indoor gym halls . Based on the number of participating athletes , bandy is the world 's second-most participated winter sport after ice hockey . Bandy is also ranked as the number two winter sport in terms of tickets sold per day of competitions at the sport 's world championship .",

  "/wiki/Sweden_national_bandy_team": "Sweden national bandy team ( Swedish : Sveriges herrlandslag i bandy ) represents Sweden in the sport of bandy . Sweden has been playing friendlies against Finland and Norway since the early 20th century . In 1907 and 1909 there were also occasional games against Russia and Denmark . The games were set up informally from 1907 and in official internationals from 1919 . Agreements were made to play friendlies against Soviet Union in the late 1940s , but the plans did not come to realization . Finland , Norway and Sweden played bandy at the Winter Olympics in Oslo in 1952 . After having seen them there , the Soviet Union invited these three countries to a four nation bandy tournament in 1954 . This was the first time a Soviet national bandy team met other national bandy teams . The four countries used somewhat different rules prior to this tournament , but the rules were adjusted to be the same for the future . Sweden won the tournament . Sweden has been taking part in the bandy world championships since the start in 1957 . The team has never finished worse than third place ( which once , in 1957 , meant last place ) and has won the championship 12 times as of 2017 [ update ] ."
