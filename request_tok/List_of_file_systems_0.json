The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/Linux": "Linux ( /\u02c8l\u026an\u0259ks/ ( listen ) LIN-\u0259ks ) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds . Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",
  "/wiki/Computer_cluster": "A computer cluster is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that , in many respects , they can be viewed as a single system . Unlike grid computers , computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task , controlled and scheduled by software . The components of a cluster are usually connected to each other through fast local area networks , with each node ( computer used as a server ) running its own instance of an operating system . In most circumstances , all of the nodes use the same hardware [ better source needed ] and the same operating system , although in some setups ( e.g . using Open Source Cluster Application Resources ( OSCAR ) ) , different operating systems can be used on each computer , or different hardware . Clusters are usually deployed to improve performance and availability over that of a single computer , while typically being much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability . Computer clusters emerged as a result of convergence of a number of computing trends including the availability of low-cost microprocessors , high-speed networks , and software for high-performance distributed computing . [ citation needed ] They have a wide range of applicability and deployment , ranging from small business clusters with a handful of nodes to some of the fastest supercomputers in the world such as IBM 's Sequoia . Prior to the advent of clusters , single unit fault tolerant mainframes with modular redundancy were employed ; but the lower upfront cost of clusters , and increased speed of network fabric has favoured the adoption of clusters . In contrast to high-reliability mainframes clusters are cheaper to scale out , but also have increased complexity in error handling , as in clusters error modes are not opaque to running programs .",

  "/wiki/LGPL": "The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) . The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components . However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License . The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components .",

While the adoption of the Linux kernel in desktop computer operating system is low , Linux-based operating systems dominate nearly every other segment of computing , from mobile devices to mainframes . Since November 2017 [ update ] , all of the world 's 500 most powerful supercomputers run Linux . The Android operating system for tablet computers , smartphones , and smartwatches also uses the Linux kernel . The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his personal computer and with no cross-platform intentions , but has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures , many more than other kernels do . Linux rapidly attracted developers and users who adopted it as the kernel for other free software projects , notably the GNU Operating System , which was created as a free , non-proprietary operating system , and based on UNIX as a by-product of the fallout of the Unix wars . The Linux kernel API , the application programming interface ( API ) through which user programs interact with the kernel , is meant to be very stable and to not break userspace programs ( some programs , such as those with GUIs , rely on other APIs as well ) . As part of the kernel 's functionality , device drivers control the hardware ; mainlined ( included in the kernel ) device drivers are also meant to be very stable . However , the interface between the kernel and loadable kernel modules ( LKMs ) , unlike in many other kernels and operating systems , is not meant to be very stable by design . The Linux kernel , developed by contributors worldwide , is a prominent example of free and open source software . Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list ( LKML ) .",

Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

It was also the name of the project initiated by Sun to build a developer and user community around the software . After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010 , Oracle decided to discontinue open development of the core software , and replaced the OpenSolaris distribution model with the proprietary Solaris Express . Prior to Oracle 's moving of core development behind closed doors , a group of former OpenSolaris developers decided to fork the core software under the name OpenIndiana . The OpenIndiana project , a part of the illumos Foundation , aims to continue the development and distribution of the OpenSolaris codebase . Since then many more illumos distributions are available for use , continuing development in open or offering support . OpenSolaris is a descendant of the UNIX System V Release 4 ( SVR4 ) code base developed by Sun and AT & T in the late 1980s . It is the only version of the System V variant of UNIX available as open source . OpenSolaris was developed as a combination of several software consolidations that were open sourced subsequent to Solaris 10 . It includes a variety of free software , including popular desktop and server software . On Friday , August 13 , 2010 , details started to emerge relating to the discontinuation of the OpenSolaris project and the pending release of a new closed-source , proprietary version of Solaris , Solaris 11 .",

  "/wiki/Fault_tolerance": "Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of ( or one or more faults within ) some of its components . If its operating quality decreases at all , the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure , as compared to a naively designed system , in which even a small failure can cause total breakdown . Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in high-availability or life-critical systems . The ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as graceful degradation . A fault-tolerant design enables a system to continue its intended operation , possibly at a reduced level , rather than failing completely , when some part of the system fails . The term is most commonly used to describe computer systems designed to continue more or less fully operational with , perhaps , a reduction in throughput or an increase in response time in the event of some partial failure . That is , the system as a whole is not stopped due to problems either in the hardware or the software . An example in another field is a motor vehicle designed so it will continue to be drivable if one of the tires is punctured , or a structure that is able to retain its integrity in the presence of damage due to causes such as fatigue , corrosion , manufacturing flaws , or impact . Within the scope of an individual system , fault tolerance can be achieved by anticipating exceptional conditions and building the system to cope with them , and , in general , aiming for self-stabilization so that the system converges towards an error-free state . However , if the consequences of a system failure are catastrophic , or the cost of making it sufficiently reliable is very high , a better solution may be to use some form of duplication . In any case , if the consequence of a system failure is so catastrophic , the system must be able to use reversion to fall back to a safe mode . This is similar to roll-back recovery but can be a human action if humans are present in the loop .",
  "/wiki/Throughput": "In general terms , throughput is the rate of production or the rate at which something is processed . When used in the context of communication networks , such as Ethernet or packet radio , throughput or network throughput is the rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel . The data these messages belong to may be delivered over a physical or logical link , or it can pass through a certain network node . Throughput is usually measured in bits per second ( bit/s or bps ) , and sometimes in data packets per second ( p/s or pps ) or data packets per time slot . The system throughput or aggregate throughput is the sum of the data rates that are delivered to all terminals in a network . Throughput is essentially synonymous to digital bandwidth consumption ; it can be analyzed mathematically by applying the queueing theory , where the load in packets per time unit is denoted as the arrival rate ( \u03bb ) , and the throughput , where the drop in packets per time unit , is denoted as the departure rate ( \u03bc ) . The throughput of a communication system may be affected by various factors , including the limitations of underlying analog physical medium , available processing power of the system components , and end-user behavior . When various protocol overheads are taken into account , useful rate of the transferred data can be significantly lower than the maximum achievable throughput ; the useful part is usually referred to as goodput .",
  "/wiki/Scalability": "Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system . In an economic context , a scalable business model implies that a company can increase sales given increased resources . For example , a package delivery system is scalable because more packages can be delivered by adding more delivery vehicles . However , if all packages had to first pass through a single warehouse for sorting , the system would not be scalable , because one warehouse can handle only a limited number of packages . In computing , scalability is a characteristic of computers , networks , algorithms , networking protocols , programs and applications . An example is a search engine , which must support increasing numbers of users , and the number of topics it indexes . Webscale is an computer architectural approach that brings the capabilities of large scale cloud computing companies into enterprise data centers . In mathematics , scalability mostly refers to closure under scalar multiplication .",
  "/wiki/Hadoop_Distributed_File_System": "Apache Hadoop ( /h\u0259\u02c8du\u02d0p/ ) is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitate using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation . It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model . Originally designed for computer clusters built from commodity hardware - still the common use - it has also found use on clusters of higher-end hardware . All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common occurrences and should be automatically handled by the framework . The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part , known as Hadoop Distributed File System ( HDFS ) , and a processing part which is a MapReduce programming model . Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster . It then transfers packaged code into nodes to process the data in parallel . This approach takes advantage of data locality , where nodes manipulate the data they have access to . This allows the dataset to be processed faster and more efficiently than it would be in a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are distributed via high-speed networking . The base Apache Hadoop framework is composed of the following modules :",

  "/wiki/Failover": "In computing and related technologies such as networking , failover is switching to a redundant or standby computer server , system , hardware component or network upon the failure or abnormal termination of the previously active application , server , system , hardware component , or network . Failover and switchover are essentially the same operation , except that failover is automatic and usually operates without warning , while switchover requires human intervention . Systems designers usually provide failover capability in servers , systems or networks requiring near-continuous availability and a high degree of reliability . At the server level , failover automation usually uses a heartbeat system that connects two servers , either through using a separate cable ( for example , RS-232 serial ports/cable ) or a network connection . As long as a regular pulse or heartbeat continues between the main server and the second server , the second server will not bring its systems online . There may also be a third spare parts server that has running spare components for hot switching to prevent downtime . The second server takes over the work of the first as soon as it detects an alteration in the heartbeat of the first machine . Some systems have the ability to send a notification of failover . Certain systems , intentionally , do not failover entirely automatically , but require human intervention . This automated with manual approval configuration runs automatically once a human has approved the failover . Failback is the process of restoring a system , component , or service previously in a state of failure back to its original , working state , and having the standby system go from functioning back to standby . The use of virtualization software has allowed failover practices to become less reliant on physical hardware through the process referred to as migration in which a running virtual machine is moved from one physical host to another , with little or no disruption in service .",

Object storage is used for purposes such as storing photos on Facebook , songs on Spotify , or files in online collaboration services , such as Dropbox .",
  "/wiki/FUSE_(filesystem)": "Filesystem in Userspace ( FUSE ) is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code . This is achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module provides only a bridge to the actual kernel interfaces . FUSE is available for Linux , FreeBSD , OpenBSD , NetBSD ( as puffs ) , OpenSolaris , Minix 3 , Android and macOS . FUSE is free software originally released under the terms of the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License .",
  "/wiki/Network_File_System": "Network File System ( NFS ) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems ( Sun ) in 1984 , allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed . NFS , like many other protocols , builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call ( ONC RPC ) system . The NFS is an open standard defined in a Request for Comments ( RFC ) , allowing anyone to implement the protocol .",
  "/wiki/Server_Message_Block": "In computer networking , Server Message Block ( SMB ) , one version of which was also known as Common Internet File System ( CIFS /s\u026afs/ ) , is a network communication protocol for providing shared access to files , printers , and serial ports between nodes on a network . It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication mechanism . Most usage of SMB involves computers running Microsoft Windows , where it was known as Microsoft Windows Network before the introduction of Active Directory . Corresponding Windows services are LAN Manager Server for the server component , and LAN Manager Workstation for the client component .",
  "/wiki/Panasas": "Panasas is a data storage company that creates network-attached storage for technical computing environments .",
  "/wiki/Parallel_File_System": "A clustered file system is a file system which is shared by being simultaneously mounted on multiple servers . There are several approaches to clustering , most of which do not employ a clustered file system ( only direct attached storage for each node ) . Clustered file systems can provide features like location-independent addressing and redundancy which improve reliability or reduce the complexity of the other parts of the cluster . Parallel file systems are a type of clustered file system that spread data across multiple storage nodes , usually for redundancy or performance .",
  "/wiki/Erasure_code": "In coding theory , an erasure code is a forward error correction ( FEC ) code under the assumption of bit erasures ( rather than bit errors ) , which transforms a message of k symbols into a longer message ( code word ) with n symbols such that the original message can be recovered from a subset of the n symbols . The fraction r = k/n is called the code rate . The fraction k/k , where k denotes the number of symbols required for recovery , is called reception efficiency .",
  "/wiki/Scale_out": "Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system . In an economic context , a scalable business model implies that a company can increase sales given increased resources . For example , a package delivery system is scalable because more packages can be delivered by adding more delivery vehicles . However , if all packages had to first pass through a single warehouse for sorting , the system would not be scalable , because one warehouse can handle only a limited number of packages . In computing , scalability is a characteristic of computers , networks , algorithms , networking protocols , programs and applications . An example is a search engine , which must support increasing numbers of users , and the number of topics it indexes . Webscale is an computer architectural approach that brings the capabilities of large scale cloud computing companies into enterprise data centers . In mathematics , scalability mostly refers to closure under scalar multiplication ."
