  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",
  "/wiki/Spanish\u2013American_War": "The Spanish-American War ( Spanish : Guerra Hispano-Americana ; Filipino : Digmaang Espanyol-Amerikano ) was an armed conflict between Spain and the United States in 1898 . Hostilities began in the aftermath of the internal explosion of USS Maine in Havana Harbor in Cuba , leading to U.S. intervention in the Cuban War of Independence . The war led to emergence of U.S. predominance in the Caribbean region , and resulted in U.S. acquisition of Spain 's Pacific possessions . That led to U.S. involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately in the Philippine-American War . The main issue was Cuban independence . Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish rule . The U.S. later backed these revolts upon entering the Spanish-American War . There had been war scares before , as in the Virginius Affair in 1873 , but in the late 1890s , American public opinion was agitated by reports of gruesome Spanish atrocities . The business community had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains . It lobbied vigorously against going to war . President William McKinley ignored the exaggerated yellow press and sought a peaceful settlement . The United States Navy armored cruiser USS Maine mysteriously exploded and sank in Havana Harbor ; political pressures from the Democratic Party pushed McKinley into a war that he had wished to avoid .",

The battle was not much of a contest . The outgunned Spanish steaming directly into a waiting superior force were slaughtered . The waters were full of hulks and wounded men until the scene turned into a rescue operation parallel to that of a natural disaster . The Americans pulled men from the water and out of small boats with inches of blood in the bottoms , treating them , feeding them , and clothing them with their own garments , until the number of rescued exceeded the crews of the rescuers . The prisoners were treated with respect and humanity . The fleet commander , on parole at Annapolis , became a celebrity .

  "/wiki/USS_Maine_(ACR-1)": "USS Maine ( ACR-1 ) was a United States Navy ship that sank in Havana Harbor in February 1898 , contributing to the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in April . American newspapers , engaging in yellow journalism to boost circulation , claimed that the Spanish were responsible for the ship 's destruction . The phrase Remember the Maine ! To hell with Spain ! became a rallying cry for action . Although the Maine explosion was not a direct cause , it served as a catalyst that accelerated the events leading up to the war . Maine was commissioned in 1895 as an armored cruiser , the first U.S. Navy ship to be named after the state of Maine . [ a ] Maine and the similar battleship Texas , were both represented as an advance in American warship design , reflecting the latest European naval developments . Both ships had two gun turrets staggered en \u00e9chelon , and full masts were omitted due to the increased reliability of steam engines . Due to a protracted 9-year construction period , Maine and Texas were obsolete by the time of completion . Far more advanced vessels were either in service or nearing completion that year .

The city of Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century and due to its strategic location it served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas , becoming a stopping point for treasure-laden Spanish galleons returning to Spain . The King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592 . Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city . The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana 's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish-American War . The city is the center of the Cuban government , and home to various ministries , headquarters of businesses and over 90 diplomatic offices . The current governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba ( PCC ) . In 2009 , the city/province had the third highest income in the country .
