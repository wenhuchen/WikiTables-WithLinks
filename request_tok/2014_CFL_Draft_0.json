The team won its first championship in 1902 and since then have also won in 1912 , 1913 , 1919 , 1928 , 1938 and 1960 prior to the inauguration of the Vanier Cup in 1965 .

McGill plays out of Percival Molson Memorial Stadium , where the Canadian Football League 's Montreal Alouettes also play . After a controversial student campaign in late 2018 that accused the traditional Redmen name of being offensive to Canadian First Nations communities , the longstanding mens varsity nickname was dropped by the university . As of May 2019 , the team has been temporarily renamed the McGill University Football Club pending an eventual rebranding . Since the retirement of long-time head coach Charlie Baillie in 2000 , the team has only won two league championships ( 2001 , 2002 ) . In October 2005 , the McGill administration cancelled the last three games of football team 's season after confirmed reports of hazing involving sexual abuse . After their 2005 suspension , the team struggled with three losing seasons , including two winless seasons in 2007 and 2008 . The program showed signs of hope as the Redmen won three games in 2009 , but soon sank back down to futility with consecutive winless campaigns in 2010 and 2011 . In 2012 , the Redmen qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2006 , but lost to perennial powerhouse Laval .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",
