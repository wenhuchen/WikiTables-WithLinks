  "/wiki/Anangula_Archeological_District": "The Anangula Site ( also Anangula Archeological District and Ananiuliak Island Archeological District ) is an archaeological site in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska . Located on a 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) long island off the western coast of Umnak Island , it lies 3.1 miles ( 5.0 km ) north-northwest of Nikolski Bay . The site documents one of the earliest known human settlements in the Aleutian Islands , dating to c. 6400 BCE . It was in the 1970s believed to be a remnant of people thought to have migrated here across the land bridge from Asia . The site is believed to have been along the southern fringe of the hypothesized Bering land bridge , by which ( according to that theory ) the Americas were first settled . At the time of its settlement , sea level was believed to be lower ( by about 100 metres ( 330 ft ) ) , and the area consisted of a strandflat surrounded by nutrient-rich waters and abundant wildlife . The immediate area of the settlement is also surrounded by evidence of volcanic ashfalls , which are theorized to contribute to the eventual abandomnent of the site , leading to the settlement of other parts of Beringia . The Anangula site was first discovered by William S. Laughlin in 1938 , when surface surveys identified the area as of potential interest . In the 1950s additional research was done in the area , but its great age was not understood until its major features were found , buried beneath 2 metres ( 6.6 ft ) of volcanic deposits . Excavations in the late 1960s uncovered all or part of eight house remains , and recovered more than 30,000 artifacts , some of which bore little resemblance to other North American finds at the time . These structures were partially subterranean , measuring about 3 metres ( 9.8 ft ) by 5.5 metres ( 18 ft ) , and were apparently designed to house single families . The site was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Ananiuliak Island Archeological District in 1972 , and was declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1978 .",
