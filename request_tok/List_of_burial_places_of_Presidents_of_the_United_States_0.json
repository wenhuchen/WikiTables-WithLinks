He set enduring precedents for the office of president , including the title President of the United States , and his Farewell Address is widely regarded as a pre-eminent statement on republicanism .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Vernon": "Mount Vernon was the plantation of George Washington , the first President of the United States , and his wife , Martha Washington . The estate is situated on the banks of the Potomac River in Fairfax County , Virginia , near Alexandria , across from Prince George 's County , Maryland . The Washington family owned land in the area since the time of Washington 's great-grandfather in 1674 . Around 1734 they embarked on an expansion of the estate that continued under George Washington , who began leasing the estate in 1754 , but did not become its sole owner until 1761 . The mansion was built of wood in a loose Palladian style ; the original house was built by George Washington 's father Augustine , around 1734 . George Washington expanded the house twice , once in the late 1750s and again in the 1770s . It remained Washington 's home for the rest of his life . Following his death in 1799 , under the ownership of several successive generations of the family , the estate progressively declined as revenues were insufficient to maintain it adequately . In 1858 , the house 's historical importance was recognized and it was saved from ruin by the Mount Vernon Ladies ' Association ; this philanthropic organization acquired it together with part of the Washington property estate . Escaping the damage suffered by many plantation houses during the American Civil War , Mount Vernon was restored .

He was the first president born speaking a language other than English ( Dutch ) and the first born after the United States had declared its independence from Great Britain . A founder of the Democratic Party , he had previously served as the ninth governor of New York , the tenth United States secretary of state , and the eighth vice president of the United States . He won the 1836 presidential election with the endorsement of popular outgoing President Andrew Jackson and the organizational strength of the Democratic Party . He lost his 1840 reelection bid to Whig Party nominee William Henry Harrison , thanks in part to the poor economic conditions surrounding the Panic of 1837 . Later in his life , Van Buren emerged as an elder statesman and an important anti-slavery leader ( abolitionist ) who led the Free Soil Party ticket in the 1848 presidential election . Van Buren was born in Kinderhook , New York , to a family of patroon Dutch Americans ; his father was a Patriot during the American Revolution . He was raised speaking Dutch and learned English at school , making him the first and still only U.S. president to speak English as his second language . He trained as a lawyer and quickly became involved in politics as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party . He won election to the New York State Senate and became the leader of the Bucktails , the faction of Democratic-Republicans opposed to New York Governor DeWitt Clinton . Van Buren established a political machine known as the Albany Regency and in the 1820s emerged as the most influential politician in the Empire State .

  "/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison": "William Henry Harrison ( February 9 , 1773 - April 4 , 1841 ) was an American military officer and politician who served as the ninth president of the United States in 1841 . He died of typhoid , pneumonia or paratyphoid fever 31 days into his term ( the shortest tenure ) , becoming the first president to die in office . His death sparked a brief constitutional crisis regarding succession to the presidency , because the Constitution was unclear as to whether Vice President John Tyler should assume the office of president or merely execute the duties of the vacant office . Tyler claimed a constitutional mandate to become the new president and took the presidential oath of office , setting an important precedent for an orderly transfer of the presidency and its full powers when the previous president fails to complete the elected term . Harrison was born in Charles City County , Virginia , the son of Founding Father Benjamin Harrison V and the paternal grandfather of Benjamin Harrison , the 23rd president of the United States . He was the last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen Colonies before the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775 . During his early military career , he participated in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers , an American military victory that effectively ended the Northwest Indian War . Later , he led a military force against Tecumseh 's Confederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 , where he earned the nickname Old Tippecanoe . He was promoted to major general in the Army in the War of 1812 , and in 1813 led American infantry and cavalry at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada . Harrison began his political career in 1798 , when he was appointed Secretary of the Northwest Territory , and in 1799 he was elected as the territory 's delegate in the House of Representatives . Two years later , President John Adams named him governor of the newly established Indiana Territory , a post he held until 1812 . After the War of 1812 , he moved to Ohio where he was elected to represent the state 's 1st district in the House in 1816 .",

Tyler ascended to the presidency after Harrison 's death in April 1841 , only a month after the start of the new administration . He was a stalwart supporter and advocate of states ' rights , and he adopted nationalist policies as president only when they did not infringe on the powers of the states . His unexpected rise to the presidency posed a threat to the presidential ambitions of Henry Clay and other politicians , and left Tyler estranged from both major political parties . Tyler was born to a prominent Virginia family and became a national figure at a time of political upheaval . In the 1820s , the nation 's only political party was the Democratic-Republican Party , and it split into factions . Tyler was initially a Democrat , but he opposed Andrew Jackson during the Nullification Crisis , seeing Jackson 's actions as infringing on states ' rights , and he criticized Jackson 's expansion of executive power during the Bank War . This led Tyler to ally with the Whig Party . He served as a Virginia state legislator , governor , U.S. representative , and U.S. senator . He was put on the 1840 presidential ticket to attract states ' rights Southerners to a Whig coalition to defeat Martin Van Buren 's re-election bid .

After building a successful law practice in Tennessee , Polk was elected to the state legislature ( 1823 ) and then to the United States House of Representatives in 1825 , becoming a strong supporter of Andrew Jackson . After serving as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , he became Speaker in 1835 , the only president to have been Speaker . Polk left Congress to run for governor of Tennessee ; he won in 1839 , but lost in 1841 and 1843 . He was a dark horse candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1844 ; he entered his party 's convention as a potential nominee for vice president , but emerged as a compromise to head the ticket when no presidential candidate could secure the necessary two-thirds majority . In the general election , Polk defeated Henry Clay of the rival Whig Party . Historians consider Polk the most effective president of the pre-Civil War era , having met during his four-year term every major domestic and foreign policy goal he had set . After a negotiation fraught with risk of war , he reached a settlement with Great Britain over the disputed Oregon Country , the territory for the most part being divided along the 49th parallel .

The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century .

He was a Young America expansionist who signed the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain . He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan , while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability , but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency .

Lincoln was born in poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the frontier primarily in Indiana . He was self-educated and became a lawyer , Whig Party leader , Illinois state legislator , and U.S . Congressman from Illinois . In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act . He reentered politics in 1854 , becoming a leader in the new Republican Party and he reached a national audience in the 1858 debates against Stephen Douglas . Lincoln ran for President in 1860 , sweeping the North in victory . Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North 's rejection of their right to practice slavery , and southern states began seceding from the union . To secure its independence , the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter , a U.S. fort in the South , and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union . As the leader of moderate Republicans , Lincoln found his political opposition was manifold , and included Radical Republicans , War Democrats , Copperheads ( anti-war Democrats ) , and irreconcilable secessionists .",
