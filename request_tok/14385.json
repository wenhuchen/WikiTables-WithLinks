During that period , they also won a European Cup Winners ' Cup and they reached the same competition semi-finals as well as the European Cup quarter-finals . KV Mechelen declined in the late 1990s though they had two more spells at the highest level from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 and in 2002-03 . At the end of that season , the club did not receive their Belgian professional football license . They were therefore relegated to the third division with a nine-point penalty .",

Roda JC Kerkrade plays in the Eerste Divisie . The club was founded by a merger between Rapid JC and Roda Sport in 1962 . They were placed in the Eerste Divisie , and after a relegation they were promoted back to the top division in 1973 , where they would stay for 41 years until being relegated in 2014 . In 2009-10 , they added Kerkrade to the name to create brand awareness and get financial support . Roda JC is known as the coal-miner 's club ; fans of archrival club MVV , from the provincial capital of Maastricht , say those words condescendingly . However , in Kerkrade and the surrounding area , they are said with pride and respect . The last Dutch coal mines were closed in the 1970s , but the southeastern part of the Netherlands ' most southern province , Limburg , is still referred to as the Mijnstreek ( mine district ) today . The coal mines are still recalled in folk songs in the regional dialect and in the stories of old miners , reminiscing about an era that will never return . Southern Limburg will always be their home . Their team , in most cases , is Roda JC . Roda JC 's club honours include seven European campaigns and six KNVB Cup finals , of which they won two .",
