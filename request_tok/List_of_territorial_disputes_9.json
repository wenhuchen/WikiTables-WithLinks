The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

  "/wiki/Arbitration": "Arbitration , a form of alternative dispute resolution ( ADR ) , is a way to resolve disputes outside the courts . The dispute will be decided by one or more persons ( the arbitrators , arbiters or arbitral tribunal ) , which renders the arbitration award . An arbitration award is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts . Arbitration is often used for the resolution of commercial disputes , particularly in the context of international commercial transactions . In certain countries such as the United States , arbitration is also frequently employed in consumer and employment matters , where arbitration may be mandated by the terms of employment or commercial contracts and may include a waiver of the right to bring a class action claim . Mandatory consumer and employment arbitration should be distinguished from consensual arbitration , particularly commercial arbitration . Arbitration can be either voluntary or mandatory ( although mandatory arbitration can only come from a statute or from a contract that one party imposes on the other , in which the parties agree to hold all existing or future disputes to arbitration , without necessarily knowing , specifically , what disputes will ever occur ) and can be either binding or non-binding . Non-binding arbitration is similar to mediation in that a decision can not be imposed on the parties . However , the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground on which to compromise , the ( non-binding ) arbiter remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and , if appropriate , an indication of the quantum of damages payable . By one definition arbitration is binding and non-binding arbitration is therefore technically not arbitration . Arbitration is a proceeding in which a dispute is resolved by an impartial adjudicator whose decision the parties to the dispute have agreed , or legislation has decreed , will be final and binding . There are limited rights of review and appeal of arbitration awards .",

The Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec region , occupying the northern half of the province , is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples . The climate around the major cities is four-seasons continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers , but farther north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions .",
  "/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland": "Newfoundland was a British dominion from 1907 to 1934 when it surrendered dominion status by ending self-government in exchange for British Royal Commission rule as a crown colony . Newfoundland remained a crown colony until Newfoundland joined Canada as a province . The dominion , situated in northeastern North America along the Atlantic coast , comprised the island of Newfoundland as well as Labrador on the continental mainland . Before attaining dominion status , Newfoundland was a British colony , self-governing from 1855 . Newfoundland was one of the original dominions within the meaning of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster of 1931 , accordingly enjoyed a constitutional status equivalent to the other dominions at the time . In 1934 , Newfoundland became the only dominion to give up its self-governing status , ending 79 years of self-government . This episode came about due to a crisis in Newfoundland 's public finances in 1932 . Newfoundland had accumulated a significant amount of debt by building a railway across the island ( completed in the 1890s ) and by raising its own regiment for the First World War . In November 1932 the government warned that Newfoundland would default on payments on the public debt . The British government quickly established the Newfoundland Royal Commission to inquire into and report on the position . The Commission 's report , published in October 1933 , recommended that Newfoundland give up its system of self-government temporarily and allow the United Kingdom to administer the dominion through an appointed commission . The Newfoundland parliament accepted this recommendation and presented a petition to the King asking for the suspension of the constitution and the appointment of commissioners to administer the government until the country became self-supporting again .",

It settled a standing border dispute between the two countries and was considered a triumph of American diplomacy . It came in the midst of increasing tensions related to Spain 's territorial boundaries in North America against the United States and Great Britain in the aftermath of the American Revolution ; it also came during the Latin American wars of independence . Florida had become a burden to Spain , which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons , so the Spanish government decided to cede the territory to the United States in exchange for settling the boundary dispute along the Sabine River in Spanish Texas . The treaty established the boundary of U.S. territory and claims through the Rocky Mountains and west to the Pacific Ocean , in exchange for the U.S. paying residents ' claims against the Spanish government up to a total of $ 5,000,000 and relinquishing the U.S. claims on parts of Spanish Texas west of the Sabine River and other Spanish areas , under the terms of the Louisiana Purchase . The treaty remained in full effect for only 183 days : from February 22 , 1821 , to August 24 , 1821 , when Spanish military officials signed the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba acknowledging the independence of Mexico ; Spain repudiated that treaty , but Mexico effectively took control of Spain 's former colony . The Treaty of Limits between Mexico and the United States , signed in 1828 and effective in 1832 , recognized the border defined by the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty as the boundary between the two nations .",

Its capital is the town of Magas . At 3,000 square km , in terms of area , the republic is the smallest of Russia 's federal subjects except for the federal cities . It was established on June 4 , 1992 , after the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was split in two . The republic is home to the indigenous Ingush , a people of Vainakh ancestry and primarily Islamic faith . As of the 2010 Census , its population was 412,529 . Largely due to the Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus , Ingushetia remains one of the poorest and most unstable regions of Russia . Although the violence has declined since the first decade of the 21st century , the insurgency in neighboring Chechnya has occasionally spilled into Ingushetia . According to Human Rights Watch in 2008 , the republic has been destabilized by corruption , a number of high-profile crimes ( including kidnapping and murder of civilians by government security forces ) , anti-government protests , attacks on soldiers and officers , Russian military excesses , and a deteriorating human rights situation . According to Russian media , Ingushetia has the lowest alcohol consumption in Russia .",
