  "/wiki/Monkey": "Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals , in part , the simians of infraorder Simiiformes . The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates , such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys . Many monkey species are tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) , although there are species that live primarily on the ground , such as baboons . Most species are also active during the day ( diurnal ) . Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent , especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini . Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago . New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago . Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago . Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [ 35-32 million years ago ] , eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists . Lemurs , lorises , and galagos are not monkeys ; instead they are strepsirrhine primates . Like monkeys , tarsiers are haplorhine primates ; however , they are also not monkeys . Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini , so cladistically they are monkeys as well .",

When the usage appeared in 1909 , it denoted ostentatious , exaggerated , affected , theatrical , or effeminate behavior , and by the middle of the 1970s , camp was defined by the college edition of Webster 's New World Dictionary as banality , mediocrity , artifice , [ and ] ostentation . so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal .

  "/wiki/Psychic": "A psychic is a person who claims to use extrasensory perception ( ESP ) to identify information hidden from the normal senses , particularly involving telepathy or clairvoyance , or who performs acts that are apparently inexplicable by natural laws . Although many people believe in psychic abilities , the scientific consensus is that there is no proof of the existence of such powers , and describes the practice as pseudoscience . The word psychic is also used as an adjective to describe such abilities . Psychics encompass people in a variety of roles . Some are theatrical performers , such as stage magicians , who use various techniques , e.g. , prestidigitation , cold reading , and hot reading , to produce the appearance of such abilities for entertainment purposes . A large industry and network exists whereby people advertised as psychics provide advice and counsel to clients . Some famous psychics include Edgar Cayce , Ingo Swann , Peter Hurkos , Janet Lee , Jose Ortiz El Samaritano , Miss Cleo , John Edward , Sylvia Browne , and Tyler Henry . Psychic powers are asserted by psychic detectives and in practices such as psychic archaeology and even psychic surgery . Critics attribute psychic powers to intentional trickery or to self-delusion . In 1988 the U.S. National Academy of Sciences gave a report on the subject and concluded there is no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena . A study attempted to repeat recently reported parapsychological experiments that appeared to support the existence of precognition . Attempts to repeat the results , which involved performance on a memory test to ascertain if post-test information would affect it , failed to produce significant effects , and thus do not support the existence of psychic ability , and is thus categorized as a pseudoscience .",
  "/wiki/Flash_(comics)": "The Flash ( or simply Flash ) is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert , the original Flash first appeared in Flash Comics # 1 ( cover date January 1940/release month November 1939 ) . Nicknamed the Scarlet Speedster , all incarnations of the Flash possess super speed , which includes the ability to run , move , and think extremely fast , use superhuman reflexes , and seemingly violate certain laws of physics . Thus far , at least four different characters - each of whom somehow gained the power of the speed force - have assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC 's history : college athlete Jay Garrick ( 1940-1951 , 1961-2011 , 2017-present ) , forensic scientist Barry Allen ( 1956-1985 , 2008-present ) , Barry 's nephew Wally West ( 1986-2011 , 2016-present ) , and Barry 's grandson Bart Allen ( 2006-2007 ) . Each incarnation of the Flash has been a key member of at least one of DC 's premier teams : the Justice Society of America , the Justice League , and the Teen Titans . The Flash is one of DC Comics ' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher 's many reality-changing crisis storylines over the years . The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in Flash of Two Worlds ( 1961 ) introduced the Multiverse storytelling concept to DC readers , which would become the basis for many DC stories in the years to come . Like his Justice League colleagues Wonder Woman , Superman and Batman , the Flash has a distinctive cast of adversaries , including the various Rogues ( unique among DC supervillains for their code of honor ) and the various psychopathic speedsters who go by the names Reverse-Flash or Zoom . Other supporting characters in Flash stories include Barry 's wife Iris West , Wally 's wife Linda Park , Bart 's girlfriend Valerie Perez , friendly fellow speedster Max Mercury , and Central City police department members David Singh and Patty Spivot . A staple of the comic book DC Universe , the Flash has been adapted to numerous DC films , video games , animated series , and live-action television shows . In live-action , Barry Allen has been portrayed by Rod Haase for the 1979 television special Legends of the Superheroes , John Wesley Shipp in the 1990 The Flash series and Grant Gustin in the 2014 The Flash series , and by Ezra Miller in the DC Extended Universe series of films , beginning with Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice ( 2016 ) . Shipp also portrays a version of Jay Garrick in the 2014 The Flash series .",

Individuals have brown-grey fur , red faces , and short tails . Two subspecies are known . In Japan , the species is known as Nihonzaru ( \u30cb\u30db\u30f3\u30b6\u30eb , a combination of Nihon \u65e5\u672c Japan + saru \u733f monkey ) to distinguish it from other primates , but the Japanese macaque is very familiar in Japan , so when Japanese people simply say saru , they usually have in mind the Japanese macaque .",
