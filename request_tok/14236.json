  "/wiki/Cable_Creek_Bridge": "The historical buildings and structures of Zion National Park represent a variety of buildings , interpretive structures , signs and infrastructure associated with the National Park Service 's operations in Zion National Park , Utah . Structures vary in size and scale from the Zion Lodge to road culverts and curbs , nearly all of which were designed using native materials and regional construction techniques in an adapted version of the National Park Service Rustic style . A number of the larger structures were designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood , while many of the smaller structures were designed or coordinated with the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs . The bulk of the historic structures date to the 1920s and 1930s . Most of the structures of the 1930s were built using Civilian Conservation Corps labor . The version of the National Park Service Rustic style that was adopted at Zion was less extreme in its rustic character than that employed at other parks . Compared with the Bryce Canyon Lodge , the Zion Park Lodge used smaller elements of timber and stonework , and employed milled lumber in place of rough log elements . This reflected the more settled character of the Zion area , which retained farms and irrigation systems at the time the first visitor facilities were built . Many of Zion 's historical structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) , either as individual structures or as contributing structures in a historic district . They represent an unusually homogeneous series of buildings for a national park , sharing details of composition , scale and materials . They have collectively been described as some the best work in the National Park Service Rustic style . ( The NRHP-listed structures are also listed in alphabetical order in National Register of Historic Places listings in Zion National Park . )",

  "/wiki/Zion_National_Park": "Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale . A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile ( 590 km2 ) park is Zion Canyon , which is 15 miles ( 24 km ) long and up to 2,640 ft ( 800 m ) deep . The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River . The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft ( 1,117 m ) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft ( 2,660 m ) at Horse Ranch Mountain . Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau , Great Basin , and Mojave Desert regions , the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity . Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds , 75 mammals ( including 19 species of bat ) , and 32 reptiles inhabit the park 's four life zones : desert , riparian , woodland , and coniferous forest . Zion National Park includes mountains , canyons , buttes , mesas , monoliths , rivers , slot canyons , and natural arches . Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans , one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi ( c. 300 CE ) . Subsequently , the Virgin Anasazi culture ( c. 500 ) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities . Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes . Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s . In 1909 , President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon .",

  "/wiki/Colorado_River": "The Colorado River is one of the principal rivers ( along with the Rio Grande ) in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico . The 1,450-mile-long ( 2,330 km ) river drains an expansive , arid watershed that encompasses parts of seven U.S. states and two Mexican states . Starting in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado , the river flows generally southwest across the Colorado Plateau and through the Grand Canyon before reaching Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border , where it turns south toward the international border . After entering Mexico , the Colorado approaches the mostly dry Colorado River Delta at the tip of the Gulf of California between Baja California and Sonora . Known for its dramatic canyons , whitewater rapids , and eleven U.S. National Parks , the Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people . The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts , which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and domestic water supply . Its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power , and its major dams regulate peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West . Intensive water consumption has dried up the lower 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the river , which has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s . Beginning with small bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers , Native Americans have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years . Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago , the watershed was home to large agricultural civilizations - considered some of the most sophisticated indigenous North American cultures - which eventually declined due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices . Most native peoples that inhabit the region today are descended from other groups that settled there beginning about 1,000 years ago . Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16th century , when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area , which became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821 .",

In 1915 , the Colorado Loop was removed , and in 1928 , a realignment relocated the Lincoln Highway through the northern tip of West Virginia . Thus , there are a total of 14 states , 128 counties , and more than 700 cities , towns and villages through which the highway passed at some time in its history . The first officially recorded length of the entire Lincoln Highway in 1913 was 3,389 miles ( 5,454 km ) . [ a ] Over the years , the road was improved and numerous realignments were made , and by 1924 the highway had been shortened to 3,142 miles ( 5,057 km ) . Counting the original route and all of the subsequent realignments , there have been a grand total of 5,872 miles ( 9,450 km ) . The Lincoln Highway was gradually replaced with numbered designations after the establishment of the U.S. Numbered Highway System in 1926 , with most of the route becoming part of U.S. Route 30 from Pennsylvania to Wyoming . After the Interstate Highway System was formed in the 1950s , the former alignments of the Lincoln Highway were largely superseded by Interstate 80 as the primary coast-to-coast route from the New York City area to San Francisco .",

  "/wiki/Great_Salt_Lake": "The Great Salt Lake , located in the northern part of the U.S. state of Utah , is the largest salt water lake in the Western Hemisphere , and the eighth-largest terminal lake in the world . In an average year the lake covers an area of approximately 1,700 square miles ( 4,400 km2 ) , but the lake 's size fluctuates substantially due to its shallowness . For instance , in 1963 it reached its lowest recorded size at 950 square miles ( 2,460 km\u00b2 ) , but in 1988 the surface area was at the historic high of 3,300 square miles ( 8,500 km2 ) . In terms of surface area , it is the largest lake in the United States that is not part of the Great Lakes region . The lake is the largest remnant of Lake Bonneville , a prehistoric pluvial lake that once covered much of western Utah . The three major tributaries to the lake , the Jordan , Weber , and Bear rivers together deposit approximately 1.1 million tons of minerals in the lake each year . As it is endorheic ( has no outlet besides evaporation ) , it has very high salinity ( far saltier than seawater ) and its mineral content is steadily increasing . Due to the high density resulting from its mineral content , swimming in the Great Salt Lake is similar to floating . Its shallow , warm waters cause frequent , sometimes heavy lake-effect snows from late fall through spring .
