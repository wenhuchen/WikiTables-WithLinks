It is the oldest Malaysian city on the Straits of Malacca , having become a successful entrep\u00f4t in the era of the Malacca Sultanate . The present-day city was founded by Parameswara , a Sumatran prince who escaped to the Malay Peninsula when Srivijaya fell to the Majapahit . Following the establishment of the Malacca Sultanate , the city drew the attention of traders from the Middle East , South Asia , and East Asia , as well as the Portuguese , who intended to dominate the trade route in Asia . After Malacca was conquered by Portugal , the city became an area of conflict when the sultanates of Aceh and Johor attempted to take control from the Portuguese . Following a number of wars between these territories , Aceh declined in influence while Johor survived and expanded its influence over territory previously lost to Aceh in Sumatra when Johor co-operated with the Dutch who arrived to establish dominance over Java and Maluku Islands . However , due to royal internal strife between the Malay and Bugis , the Johor-Riau Empire was divided into the sultanates of Johor and Riau-Lingga . This separation became permanent when the British arrived to establish their presence in the Malay Peninsula . The Dutch , who already felt threatened in the presence of the British , began conquering the Riau-Lingga Sultanate along with the rest of Sumatra , while Johor came under British influence following the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 . When the British succeeded in extending their influence over the Malay Peninsula , the city soon became an area of development under the Straits Settlements as part of the British Empire . The development and burgeoning prosperity were , however , halted when the Japanese arrived in World War II and occupied the area from 1942 to 1945 ."
