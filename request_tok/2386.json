  "/wiki/\u014ckami": "\u014ckami ( Japanese : \u5927\u795e , lit . great god or great spirit ) is an action-adventure video game developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom . It was released for PlayStation 2 in 2006 in Japan and North America , and in 2007 in Europe and Australia . After the closure of Clover Studio a few months after the release , a port for Wii was developed by Ready at Dawn , Tose and Capcom , and released in 2008 . Set in classical Japan , \u014ckami combines Japanese mythology and folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess , named Amaterasu , who took the form of a white wolf . It features a sumi-e-inspired cel-shaded visual style and the Celestial Brush , a gesture-system to perform miracles . The game was planned to use more traditional realistic rendering , but this had put a strain on the graphics processing of the PlayStation 2 . Clover Studio switched to a cel-shaded style to reduce the processing , which led to the Celestial Brush concept . The gameplay is modeled on The Legend of Zelda , one of director Hideki Kamiya 's favorite series . \u014ckami was one of the last PlayStation 2 games released prior to the release of the PlayStation 3 . Although it suffered from poor sales , the game received critical acclaim , earning IGN 's 2006 Game of the Year . The Wii version earned similar praise , though the motion control scheme received mixed reviews .",

As a fifth generation console , the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn . The PlayStation was the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units , which it had reached nine years after its initial launch . In July 2000 , a redesigned , slim version called the PS one was released , replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor , the PlayStation 2 . The PlayStation 2 , which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation 's DualShock controller and games , was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000 . The last PS one units were sold in late 2006 to early 2007 shortly after it was officially discontinued , for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch eleven years earlier .

The player controls a child who has fallen into the Underground : a large , secluded region under the surface of the Earth , separated by a magic barrier .

The combat system involves the player navigating through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent . They can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of killing them . These choices affect the game , with the dialogue , characters , and story changing based on outcomes . Outside of some artwork , Fox developed the entirety of the game by himself , including the script and music . The game took inspiration from several sources .

  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries .",

Critics and third-party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors ; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as significant and obvious .

While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West .
