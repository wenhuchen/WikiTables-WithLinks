The copper statue , a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States , was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel . The statue was dedicated on October 28 , 1886 . The Statue of Liberty is a figure of Libertas , a robed Roman liberty goddess . She holds a torch above her head with her right hand , and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with JULY IV MDCCLXXVI ( July 4 , 1776 ) , the date of the U.S . Declaration of Independence . A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks forward , commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery . After its dedication , the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States ; it has been a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving by sea . Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician , \u00c9douard Ren\u00e9 de Laboulaye , who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples . Because of the post-war instability in France , work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s . In 1875 , Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal . Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed , and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions .",
