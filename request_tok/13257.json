  "/wiki/Web_design": "Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites . The different areas of web design include web graphic design ; interface design ; authoring , including standardised code and proprietary software ; user experience design ; and search engine optimization . Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process , although some designers will cover them all . The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end ( client side ) design of a website including writing markup . Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development . Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines .",
  "/wiki/Blog": "A blog ( a truncation of weblog ) is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete , often informal diary-style text entries ( posts ) . Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order , so that the most recent post appears first , at the top of the web page . Until 2009 , blogs were usually the work of a single individual , [ citation needed ] occasionally of a small group , and often covered a single subject or topic . In the 2010s , multi-author blogs ( MABs ) emerged , featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited . MABs from newspapers , other media outlets , universities , think tanks , advocacy groups , and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic . The rise of Twitter and other microblogging systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media . Blog can also be used as a verb , meaning to maintain or add content to a blog . The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming . Previously , a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web , and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts . In the 2010s , the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites , allowing visitors to leave online comments , and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites . In that sense , blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service . Indeed , bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs , but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers .",

  "/wiki/Donald_Judd": "Donald Judd ( June 3 , 1928 - February 12 , 1994 ) was an American artist associated with minimalism ( a term he nonetheless stridently disavowed ) . In his work , Judd sought autonomy and clarity for the constructed object and the space created by it , ultimately achieving a rigorously democratic presentation without compositional hierarchy . It created an outpouring of seemingly effervescent works that defied the term minimalism . Nevertheless , he is generally considered the leading international exponent of minimalism , and its most important theoretician through such seminal writings as Specific Objects ( 1964 ) . Judd voices his unorthodox perception of minimalism in Arts Yearbook 8 , where he asserts ; The new three dimensional work does n't constitute a movement , school , or style . The common aspects are too general and too little common to define a movement . The differences are greater than the similarities Through his work Judd shines light on the profound effect on new three dimensional by specificity and generality .",

  "/wiki/Anime": "Anime ( US : /\u02c8\u00e6n\u0259\u02ccme\u026a/ , UK : /\u02c8\u00e6n\u026a\u02ccme\u026a/ ) ( Japanese : \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1 , Hepburn : anime , [ a\u0272ime ] ( listen ) , plural : anime ) [ a ] is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from or associated with Japan . The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies . It combines graphic art , characterization , cinematography , and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques .",
  "/wiki/Video_game": "A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen , virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set . Since the 1980s , video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry , and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute . The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others . Specialized platforms such as arcade games , which present the game in a large , typically coin-operated chassis , were common in the 1980s in video arcades , but declined in popularity as other , more affordable platforms became available . These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles , as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop , desktop or handheld computing devices . The input device used for games , the game controller , varies across platforms . Common controllers include gamepads , joysticks , mouse devices , keyboards , the touchscreens of mobile devices , or even a person 's body , using a Kinect sensor . Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles . There are often game sound effects , music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones . Some games in the 2000s include haptic , vibration-creating effects , force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets . Since the 2010s , the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing .",
