According to the author Peter Thomson , for its first two centuries , Drury Lane could reasonably have claimed to be London 's leading theatre . For most of that time , it was one of a handful of patent theatres , granted monopoly rights to the production of legitimate drama in London ( meaning spoken plays , rather than opera , dance , concerts , or plays with music ) . The first theatre on the site was built at the behest of Thomas Killigrew in the early 1660s , when theatres were allowed to reopen during the English Restoration . Initially known as Theatre Royal in Bridges Street , the theatre 's proprietors hired prominent actors who performed at the theatre on a regular basis , including Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart . In 1672 , the theatre caught fire and Killigrew built a larger theatre on the same plot , renamed the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane ; it opened in 1674 . This building lasted nearly 120 years , under the leaderships of Colley Cibber , David Garrick and Richard Brinsley Sheridan , the last of whom employed Joseph Grimaldi as the theatre 's resident Clown . In 1791 , under Sheridan 's management , the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794 . This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809 .
