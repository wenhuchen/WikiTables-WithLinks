Roosevelt during his first 100 days in office , Long eventually came to believe that Roosevelt 's New Deal policies were an insufficient compromise and did not do enough to alleviate the issues of the poor or tackle the Depression . As a result , he developed his own solution called the Share Our Wealth program , which would establish a net asset tax , the earnings of which would be redistributed so as to curb the poverty and homelessness epidemic nationwide during the Great Depression . Long 's Share Our Wealth plan was established on February 23 , 1934 , with the motto Every Man a King .
