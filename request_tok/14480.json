  "/wiki/Regency_architecture": "Regency architecture encompasses classical buildings built in the United Kingdom during the Regency era in the early 19th century when George IV was Prince Regent , and also to earlier and later buildings following the same style . The period coincides with the Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands , Federal style in the United States and the French Empire style . Regency style is also applied to interior design and decorative arts of the period , typified by elegant furniture and vertically striped wallpaper , and to styles of clothing ; for men , as typified by the dandy Beau Brummell , for women the Empire silhouette . The style is strictly the late phase of Georgian architecture , and follows closely on from the neo-classical style of the preceding years , which indeed continued to be produced throughout the period . The Georgian period takes its name from the four Kings George of the period 1714-1830 , including King George IV . The British Regency strictly lasted only from 1811 to 1820 , but the term is applied to architecture more widely , both before 1811 and after 1820 ; the next reign , of William IV from 1830 to 1837 , has not been given its own stylistic descriptor . Regency architecture is especially distinctive in its houses , and also marked by an increase in the use of a range of eclectic revival styles , from Gothic through Greek to Indian , as alternatives to the main neoclassical stream . The opening years of the style were marked by greatly reduced levels of building because of the Napoleonic Wars , which saw government spending on building eliminated , shortages of imported timber , and high taxes on other building materials . In 1810 there was a serious financial crisis , though the only major asset class not to lose value was houses , at least in London , mainly because the low level of recent building had created pent-up demand . After the decisive victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 ended the wars for good , there was a long financial boom amid greatly increased British self-confidence . Most Regency architecture comes from this period .",
  "/wiki/Toronto": "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada , with a population of 2,954,024 as of July 2018 . Current to 2016 , the Toronto census metropolitan area ( CMA ) , of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) , held a population of 5,928,040 , making it Canada 's most populous CMA . The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe , an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people ( as of 2016 ) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario . Toronto is an international centre of business , finance , arts , and culture , and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world . People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada . More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group , and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants .",
  "/wiki/Ontario": "Ontario is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada .

Ontario is fourth-largest jurisdiction in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included . It is home to the nation 's capital city , Ottawa , and the nation 's most populous city , Toronto , which is also Ontario 's provincial capital . Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west , Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north , and Quebec to the east and northeast , and to the south by the U.S. states of ( from west to east ) Minnesota , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York . Almost all of Ontario 's 2,700 km ( 1,678 mi ) border with the United States follows inland waterways : from the westerly Lake of the Woods , eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system . These include Rainy River , Pigeon River , Lake Superior , St. Marys River , Lake Huron , St. Clair River , Lake St. Clair , Detroit River , Lake Erie , Niagara River , Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from Kingston , Ontario , to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall , Ontario . There is only about 1 km ( 0.6 mi ) of land border , made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border . Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions , Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario . The great majority of Ontario 's population and arable land is in the south . In contrast , the larger , northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation .",

  "/wiki/Henry_Bowyer_Lane": "Henry Bowyer Joseph Lane ( 1817-1878 ) was an English architect who worked in Toronto from c. 1841 to 1847 . Lane was born to Henry Bower Lane , a Royal Artillery Captain and Elizabeth Lacey in 1817 and moved to Devon , England after 1819 . Lane 's education included time at Blundell 's School in Tiverton and subsequent professional training in England before he emigrated to Canada in 1841 , living first in Cobourg , Upper Canada , and then in Toronto ( around 1843-1844 ) . One of Lane 's most significant contributions is Osgoode Hall , namely the west and central wings from 1844 to 1846 . He designed and oversaw the construction of the incorporated city of Toronto 's second city hall in 1844 . Lane 's limited commissions outside of Toronto , in Niagara-on-the-Lake and Cobourg , were never as grand as his work in Toronto . During his time in Toronto , Lane married Lucy Anne Sharpe in 1844 , and they left the city in 1847 . He is known to have been in the Colony of Victoria , Australia thereafter . In the Ovens Directory for the year 1857 , ( State Library of New South Wales ) , he is listed as Henry Bowyer Lane Esq. , Subwarden and Chinese Protector and Magistrate for the Yachandandah Creek Goldfield , near Bright . He was still in the Victorian Alps in 1862 , because his fine watercolour , The Buckland near the Camp , clearly signed and dated May 1862 , is held by the State Library of Victoria ( Australia ) . It shows the Buckland Hotel and the Buckland Post Office , and eight Chinese gold miners crossing the bridge over the Buckland River during the Australian gold rush . A European man ( maybe the postmaster , William McKay ) is sitting on the steps of the Post Office , chatting to a European woman ."
