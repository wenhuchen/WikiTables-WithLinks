Although the stadium was originally built as a baseball-specific venue , it became more popular as a pro-football stadium despite hosting both sports for a majority of its life . The Broncos called Mile High Stadium home from their beginning in the AFL in 1960 until 2000 . The Bears , who changed their name to the Zephyrs in 1985 , continued to play in the stadium until 1992 when the franchise was moved to New Orleans . The move was precipitated by the awarding of a Major League Baseball franchise to the city of Denver , and in 1993 the Colorado Rockies season opened in Mile High . The team played the 1993 and strike-shortened 1994 seasons in Mile High setting MLB attendance records while Coors Field was being constructed in downtown Denver .
