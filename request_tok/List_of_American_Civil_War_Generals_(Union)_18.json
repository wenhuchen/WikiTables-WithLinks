  "/wiki/Battle_of_Trevilian_Station": "The Battle of Trevilian Station ( also called Trevilians ) was fought on June 11-12 , 1864 , in Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant 's Overland Campaign against Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia . Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan fought against Confederate cavalry under Maj. Gens . Wade Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee in the bloodiest and largest all-cavalry battle of the war . Sheridan 's objectives for his raid were to destroy stretches of the Virginia Central Railroad , provide a diversion that would occupy Confederate cavalry from understanding Grant 's planned crossing of the James River , and to link up with the army of Maj. Gen. David Hunter at Charlottesville . Hampton 's cavalry beat Sheridan to the railroad at Trevilian Station and on June 11 they fought to a standstill . Brig . Gen. George A. Custer entered the Confederate rear area and captured Hampton 's supply train , but soon became surrounded and fought desperately to avoid destruction . On June 12 , the cavalry forces clashed again to the northwest of Trevilian Station , and seven assaults by Brig . Gen. Alfred T. A. Torbert 's Union division were repulsed with heavy losses . Sheridan withdrew his force to rejoin Grant 's army . The battle was a tactical victory for the Confederates and Sheridan failed to achieve his goal of permanently destroying the Virginia Central Railroad or of linking up with Hunter . Its distraction , however , may have contributed to Grant 's successful crossing of the James River .",

Employing audacity and rapid , unpredictable movements on interior lines , Jackson 's 17,000 men marched 646 miles ( 1,040 km ) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies ( 52,000 men ) , preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond . Jackson suffered a tactical defeat ( his sole defeat of the war ) at the First Battle of Kernstown ( March 23 , 1862 ) against Col. Nathan Kimball ( part of Union Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks 's army ) , but it proved to be a strategic Confederate victory because President Abraham Lincoln reinforced the Union 's Valley forces with troops that had originally been designated for the Peninsula campaign against Richmond . On May 8 , after more than a month of skirmishing with Banks , Jackson moved deceptively to the west of the Valley and drove back elements of Maj. Gen. John C. Fr\u00e9mont 's army in the Battle of McDowell , preventing a potential combination of the two Union armies against him . Jackson then headed down the Valley once again to confront Banks . Concealing his movement in the Luray Valley , Jackson joined forces with Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell and captured the Federal garrison at Front Royal on May 23 , causing Banks to retreat to the north . On May 25 , in the First Battle of Winchester , Jackson defeated Banks and pursued him until the Union Army crossed the Potomac River into Maryland .

  "/wiki/Anaconda_Plan": "The Anaconda Plan is the name applied to a Union Army outline strategy for suppressing the Confederacy at the beginning of the American Civil War . Proposed by Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott , the plan emphasized a Union blockade of the Southern ports and called for an advance down the Mississippi River to cut the South in two . Because the blockade would be rather passive , it was widely derided by a vociferous faction of Union generals who wanted a more vigorous prosecution of the war and likened it to the coils of an anaconda suffocating its victim . The snake image caught on , giving the proposal its popular name . In the early days of the Civil War , Scott 's proposed strategy for the war against the South had two prominent features . First , all ports in the seceding states were to be rigorously blockaded . Secondly , a strong column of perhaps 80,000 men should use the Mississippi River as a highway to thrust completely through the Confederacy . A spearhead , a relatively-small amphibious force of army troops transported by boats and supported by gunboats , should advance rapidly , capturing the Confederate positions down the river in sequence . It would be followed by a more traditional army , marching behind to secure victories . The culminating battle would be for the forts below New Orleans .

Following the bloody but inconclusive Battle of the Wilderness , Grant 's army disengaged from Confederate General Robert E.

Elements of Lee 's army beat the Union army to the critical crossroads of Spotsylvania Court House , Virginia , and began entrenching . Fighting occurred on and off from May 8 through May 21 , 1864 , as Grant tried various schemes to break the Confederate line . In the end , the battle was tactically inconclusive , but both sides declared victory . The Confederacy declared victory because they were able to hold their defenses . The United States declared victory because the Federal offensive continued and Lee 's army suffered losses that could not be replaced . With almost 32,000 casualties on both sides , Spotsylvania was the costliest battle of the campaign . On May 8 , Union Maj. Gens . Gouverneur K. Warren and John Sedgwick unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge the Confederates under Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson from Laurel Hill , a position that was blocking them from Spotsylvania Court House .

The victory , a product of Lee 's audacity and Hooker 's timid decision-making , was tempered by heavy casualties , including Lt. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson . Jackson was hit by friendly fire , requiring his left arm to be amputated . He died of pneumonia eight days later , a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm . Lee 's difficulty in replacing his lost men as well as his inability to prevent the Union withdrawal effectively have led to his great victory being regarded as a Pyrrhic one . The Chancellorsville campaign began with the crossing of the Rappahannock River by the Union army on the morning of April 27 , 1863 . Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman began a long-distance raid against Lee 's supply lines at about the same time . This operation was completely ineffectual .",
  "/wiki/New_Jersey": "New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Northeastern United States . It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York ; on the east , southeast , and south by the Atlantic Ocean ; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and the State of Delaware . New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",
