The Fall of the Gods ) is a 1969 Italian-German historical drama film written and directed by Luchino Visconti . The plot centers on the Essenbecks , a wealthy industrialist family who have begun doing business with the Nazi Party , a thinly veiled reference to the Essen-based Krupp family of steel industrialists . The Italian title is the conventional translation of the term G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung ( with its Wagnerian association ) , but for the German version , the title Die Verdammten ( The Damned ) was chosen . All versions , however , use G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung as a subtitle . Filming took place in Italy and Germany .",

Originally , to the ancient Greeks , the title was simply Oedipus ( \u039f\u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 ) , as it is referred to by Aristotle in the Poetics . It is thought to have been renamed Oedipus Tyrannus to distinguish it from another of Sophocles 's plays , Oedipus at Colonus . In antiquity , the term tyrant referred to a ruler with no legitimate claim to rule , but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation . Of Sophocles 's three Theban plays that have survived , and that deal with the story of Oedipus , Oedipus Rex was the second to be written . However , in terms of the chronology of events that the plays describe , it comes first , followed by Oedipus at Colonus and then Antigone . Prior to the start of Oedipus Rex , Oedipus has become the king of Thebes while unwittingly fulfilling a prophecy that he would kill his father , Laius ( the previous king ) , and marry his mother , Jocasta ( whom Oedipus took as his queen after solving the riddle of the Sphinx ) . The action of Sophocles 's play concerns Oedipus 's search for the murderer of Laius in order to end a plague ravaging Thebes , unaware that the killer he is looking for is none other than himself . At the end of the play , after the truth finally comes to light , Jocasta hangs herself while Oedipus , horrified at his patricide and incest , proceeds to gouge out his own eyes in despair . Oedipus Rex is regarded by many scholars as the masterpiece of ancient Greek tragedy . In his Poetics , Aristotle refers several times to the play in order to exemplify aspects of the genre .",

His first plays were written later than or contemporary with those of Aeschylus , and earlier than or contemporary with those of Euripides . Sophocles wrote over 120 plays during the course of his life , but only seven have survived in a complete form : Ajax , Antigone , Women of Trachis , Oedipus Rex , Electra , Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus . For almost 50 years , Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens that took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia . He competed in 30 competitions , won 24 , and was never judged lower than second place . Aeschylus won 13 competitions , and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles , while Euripides won four competitions . The most famous tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone : they are generally known as the Theban plays , although each play was actually a part of a different tetralogy , the other members of which are now lost . Sophocles influenced the development of drama , most importantly by adding a third actor , thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot . He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus .",

  "/wiki/Women_in_Love": "Women in Love ( 1920 ) is a novel by British author D. H. Lawrence . It is a sequel to his earlier novel The Rainbow ( 1915 ) , and follows the continuing loves and lives of the Brangwen sisters , Gudrun and Ursula . Gudrun Brangwen , an artist , pursues a destructive relationship with Gerald Crich , an industrialist . Lawrence contrasts this pair with the love that develops between Ursula Brangwen and Rupert Birkin , an alienated intellectual who articulates many opinions associated with the author . The emotional relationships thus established are given further depth and tension by an intense psychological and physical attraction between Gerald and Rupert . The novel ranges over the whole of British society before the time of the First World War and eventually concludes in the snows of the Tyrolean Alps . Ursula 's character draws on Lawrence 's wife Frieda and Gudrun 's on Katherine Mansfield , while Rupert Birkin 's has elements of Lawrence himself , and Gerald Crich is partly based on Mansfield 's husband , John Middleton Murry .",
  "/wiki/D._H._Lawrence": "David Herbert Lawrence ( 11 September 1885 - 2 March 1930 ) was an English writer and poet . His collected works represent , among other things , an extended reflection upon the dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialisation . Some of the issues Lawrence explores are sexuality , emotional health , vitality , spontaneity , and instinct . Lawrence 's opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution , censorship , and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life , much of which he spent in a voluntary exile he called his savage pilgrimage . At the time of his death , his public reputation was that of a pornographer who had wasted his considerable talents . E. M. Forster , in an obituary notice , challenged this widely held view , describing him as the greatest imaginative novelist of our generation . Later , the literary critic F. R. Leavis championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness ."
