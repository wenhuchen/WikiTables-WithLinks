Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street .

New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water .

One hundred and eighteen were completed , with four being combat ready . During the war only two were put into active service and went on patrols , but these were not used in combat . They were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged , rather than spending most of their time as surface ships that could submerge for brief periods as a means to escape detection . They incorporated many batteries to increase the time they could spend submerged , to as much as several days , and they only needed to surface to periscope depth for recharging via a snorkel . The design included many general improvements as well : much greater underwater speed by an improved hull design , greatly improved diving times , power-assisted torpedo reloading and greatly improved crew accommodations . However , the design was also flawed in many ways , with the submarines being mechanically unreliable and vulnerable to combat damage . The Type XXI submarines were also rushed into production before design work was complete , and the inexperienced facilities which constructed the boats were unable to meet necessary quality standards . After the war , several navies obtained XXIs and operated them for decades in various roles and large navies introduced new submarine designs based on them .

  "/wiki/Sunderland,_Co_Durham": "Sunderland ( /\u02c8s\u028cnd\u0259rl\u0259nd/ ( listen ) ) is a city at the centre of the City of Sunderland metropolitan borough , in Tyne and Wear , England , 12 miles northeast of Durham and 10 miles southeast of Newcastle upon Tyne , at the mouth of the River Wear . Historically in County Durham , there were three original settlements by the mouth of the River Wear on the site of modern-day Sunderland . On the north side of the river , Monkwearmouth was settled in 674 when King Ecgfrith of Northumbria granted land to Benedict Biscop to found Monkwearmouth Monastery . In 685 , Ecgfrith further granted Biscop the land adjacent to the monastery on the south side of the river . As the river separated this land from the monastic community , it was henceforth referred to as the sunder-land , and would grow as a fishing settlement before being granted a charter in 1179 . West of the medieval village of Sunderland on the south bank , Bishopwearmouth was founded in 930 . Sunderland grew as a port , trading coal and salt . Ships began to be built on the river in the 14th century . By the 19th century , the port of Sunderland had absorbed Bishopwearmouth and Monkwearmouth , owing to the growing economic importance of the shipbuilding docks . Following the decline of the city 's traditional industries in the late 20th century , the area grew into a commercial centre for the automotive industry , science and technology and the service sector . Bede , sometimes called the father of English history , began his monastic career at Monkwearmouth monastery in Sunderland , before moving to the newly founded Jarrow monastery in 685 ( these monasteries together formed the dual Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey ) . It therefore seems likely that he was born in or near Sunderland .",

  "/wiki/Todd_Houston_Shipbuilding_Corporation": "Vigor Shipyards ( formerly Todd Shipyards ) was founded in 1916 as the William H. Todd Corporation through the merger of Robins Dry Dock & Repair Company of Erie Basin , Brooklyn , New York , the Tietjen & Long Dry Dock Company of Hoboken , New Jersey , and the Seattle Construction and Dry Dock Company . The Seattle shipyard could trace its history back to 1882 , when Robert Moran opened a marine repair shop at Yesler 's Wharf . This shop became the Moran Brothers Shipyard in 1906 and the Seattle Construction & Dry Dock Company at the end of 1911 . The shipyard has performed building and maintenance work for , among others , the U.S. and Royal Australian Navies , the United States Coast Guard , and the Washington State Ferries .

Originally , the Coast Guard wanted to acquire 25 Offshore Patrol Cutters ( OPC ) and spend about $ 8 billion for them .",
  "/wiki/Houston,_Texas": "Houston ( /\u02c8hju\u02d0st\u0259n/ ( listen ) HEW-st\u0259n ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Texas , fourth most populous city in the United States , most populous city in the Southern United States , as well as the sixth most populous in North America , with an estimated 2018 population of 2,325,502 . Located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico , it is the seat of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston metropolitan area , which is the fifth most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States and the second most populous in Texas after the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex , with a population of 6,997,384 in 2018 . Comprising a total area of 637.4 square miles ( 1,651 km2 ) , Houston is the eighth most expansive city in the United States ( including consolidated city-counties ) . It is the largest city in the United States by total area , whose government is not consolidated with that of a county , parish or borough . Though primarily in Harris County , small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties , bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands . The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30 , 1836 , at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou ( a point now known as Allen 's Landing ) and incorporated as a city on June 5 , 1837 . The city is named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas ' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of Allen 's Landing . After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation . Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment , Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits ( after New York City ) .",
