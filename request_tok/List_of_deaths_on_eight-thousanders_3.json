It is located mainly in the Himalayas , but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain . With an estimated population of 26.4 million , it is 48th largest country by population and 93rd largest country by area . It borders China in the north and India in the south , east and west while Bangladesh is located within only 27 km ( 17 mi ) of its southeastern tip and Bhutan is separated from it by the Indian state of Sikkim . Nepal has a diverse geography , including fertile plains , subalpine forested hills , and eight of the world 's ten tallest mountains , including Mount Everest , the highest point on Earth . Kathmandu is the capital and the largest city . Nepal is a multiethnic country with Nepali as the official language . The name Nepal is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent , the era in ancient India when Hinduism was founded , the predominant religion of the country . In the middle of the first millennium BCE , Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal . Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet . The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans , and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala . The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley 's traders .",
  "/wiki/India": "India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat ) , officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya ) , is a country in South Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",
  "/wiki/Altitude_sickness": "Altitude sickness , the mildest form being acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) , is the negative health effect of high altitude , caused by rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen at high elevation . Symptoms may include headaches , vomiting , tiredness , trouble sleeping , and dizziness . Acute mountain sickness can progress to high altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) with associated shortness of breath or high altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) with associated confusion . Chronic mountain sickness may occur after long term exposure to high altitude . Altitude sickness typically occurs only above 2,500 metres ( 8,000 ft ) , though some are affected at lower altitudes . Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness , a high degree of activity , and a rapid increase in elevation . Diagnosis is based on symptoms and is supported in those who have more than a minor reduction in activities . It is recommended that at high-altitude any symptoms of headache , nausea , shortness of breath , or vomiting be assumed to be altitude sickness . Prevention is by gradually increasing elevation by no more than 300 metres ( 1,000 ft ) per day . Being physically fit does not decrease the risk . Treatment is generally by descending to a lower altitude and sufficient fluids . Mild cases may be helped by ibuprofen , acetazolamide , or dexamethasone .",

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river . At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent . Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017 .",

  "/wiki/High-altitude_cerebral_edema": "High-altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) is a medical condition in which the brain swells with fluid because of the physiological effects of traveling to a high altitude . It generally appears in patients who have acute mountain sickness and involves disorientation , lethargy , and nausea among other symptoms . It occurs when the body fails to acclimatize while ascending to a high altitude . It appears to be a vasogenic edema ( fluid penetration of the blood-brain barrier ) , although cytotoxic edema ( cellular retention of fluids ) may play a role as well . Individuals with the condition must immediately descend to a lower altitude or coma and death can occur . Patients are usually given supplemental oxygen and dexamethasone as well . HACE can be prevented by ascending to heights slowly to allow the body more time to acclimatize . Acetazolamide also helps prevent the condition . Untreated patients usually die within 48 hours . Those who receive treatment may take weeks to fully recover . It is a rare condition , occurring in less than one percent of people who ascend to 4,000 metres ( 13,000 ft ) . First described in 1913 , little was known about the cause of the condition until MRI studies were performed in the 1990s .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) ."
