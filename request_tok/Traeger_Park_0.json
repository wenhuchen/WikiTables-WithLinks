  "/wiki/Australian_Rules_Football": "Australian rules football , officially known as Australian football , or simply called Aussie rules , football or footy , is a contact sport played between two teams of eighteen players on an oval-shaped field , often a modified cricket ground . Points are scored by kicking the oval-shaped ball between the middle goal posts ( worth six points ) or between a goal and behind post ( worth one point ) . During general play , players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball . The primary methods are kicking , handballing and running with the ball . There are rules on how the ball can be handled : for example , players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground . Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball . A distinctive feature of the game is the mark , where players anywhere on the field who catch the ball from a kick ( with specific conditions ) are awarded possession . Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid . Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents . Dangerous physical contact ( such as pushing an opponent in the back ) , interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks , distance penalties or suspension for a certain number of matches , depending on the seriousness of the infringement . The game features frequent physical contests , spectacular marking , fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring . The sport 's origins can be traced to football matches played in Melbourne , Victoria in 1858 , inspired by English public school football games .",

The AFL promotes the concept as recognition of the indigenous Australians ' contribution to the national competition , with approximately one in ten AFL players identifying as an Indigenous Australian . The AFL has been criticised for letting its clubs prevent the All-Stars from selecting its top Indigenous senior players , or for placing restrictions on their game time . Additionally , the competing club side often treats the match as a preseason practice match , such that winning the match is less important than developing young players or building match fitness prior to the regular season . Despite this , the match remains popular with spectators in the Northern Territory . The best on ground for the Indigenous All-Stars is awarded the Polly Farmer Medal which is in honour of Graham Farmer . As of 2015 , the All-Stars have won six of the eight matches it has played . The record attendance for the match was 17,500 , in the 2003 match against Carlton at Marrara Oval .",
