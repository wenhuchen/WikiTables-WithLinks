  "/wiki/Shareholder_rights_plan": "A shareholder rights plan , colloquially known as a poison pill , is a type of defensive tactic used by a corporation 's board of directors against a takeover . In the field of mergers and acquisitions , shareholder rights plans were devised in the early 1980s as a way to prevent takeover bidders from negotiating a price for sale of shares directly with shareholders , and instead forcing the bidder to negotiate with the board . Typically , such a plan gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if one shareholder buys a certain percentage or more of the company 's shares . The plan could be triggered , for instance , if any one shareholder buys 20% of the company 's shares , at which point every shareholder ( except the one who possesses 20% ) will have the right to buy a new issue of shares at a discount . If every other shareholder is able to buy more shares at a discount , such purchases would dilute the bidder 's interest , and the cost of the bid would rise substantially . Knowing that such a plan could be activated , the bidder could be disinclined to take over the corporation without the board 's approval , and would first negotiate with the board in order to revoke the plan . The plan can be issued by the board of directors as an option or a warrant attached to existing shares , and only be revoked at the discretion of the board .",
