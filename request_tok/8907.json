It was the first season of the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) , which saw the Tennessee Volunteers win the national championship , one year after star quarterback Peyton Manning left for the National Football League ( NFL ) . Tennessee defeated the Florida State Seminoles , 23-16 , in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe , Arizona , to secure the inaugural BCS National Championship . The BCS combined elements of the old Bowl Coalition and the Bowl Alliance it replaced . The agreement existed between the Rose , Fiesta , Sugar , and Orange bowl games , with the Cotton Bowl Classic diminishing in status since the breakup of the Southwest Conference . Like the Bowl Alliance , a national championship game would rotate between the four bowls , with the top two teams facing each other . These teams were chosen based upon a BCS poll , combining the AP Poll , the Coaches Poll , and a computer component . The computer factored in things such as strength of schedule , margin of victory , and quality wins without taking into account time ( in other words , a loss early in the season and a loss late in the season were on equal footing ) . Like the Bowl Coalition , the BCS bowls not hosting the national championship game would retain their traditional conference tie-ins . The first run of the Bowl Championship Series was not without controversy as Kansas State finished third in the final BCS standings , but was not invited to a BCS bowl game . Ohio State ( ranked 4th ) and two-loss Florida ( 8th ) received the at-large bids instead . Also , Tulane went undefeated , but finished 10th in the BCS standings and was not invited to a BCS bowl because of their low strength of schedule .",
