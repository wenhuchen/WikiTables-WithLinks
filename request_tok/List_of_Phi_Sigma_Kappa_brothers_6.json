The operation was opposed by German forces in the area of Anzio and Nettuno . Nettuno was the German name for the Battle of Anzio . The operation was initially commanded by Major General John P. Lucas , of the U.S. Army , commanding U.S. VI Corps with the intention being to outflank German forces at the Winter Line and enable an attack on Rome . The success of an amphibious landing at that location , in a basin consisting substantially of reclaimed marshland and surrounded by mountains , depended on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could build up strength and move inland relative to the reaction time and strength of the defenders . Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders . Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark , commander of the U.S. Fifth Army , understood that risk , but he did not pass on his appreciation of the situation to his subordinate , [ citation needed ] Lucas , who preferred to take time to entrench against an expected counterattack . The initial landing achieved complete surprise with no opposition and a jeep patrol even made it as far as the outskirts of Rome . However , Lucas , who had little confidence in the operation as planned , failed to capitalize on the element of surprise and delayed his advance until he judged his position was sufficiently consolidated and he had sufficient strength . While Lucas consolidated , Field Marshal Albert Kesselring , the German commander in the Italian theatre , moved every unit he could spare into a defensive ring around the beachhead . His artillery units had a clear view of every Allied position . The Germans also stopped the drainage pumps and flooded the reclaimed marsh with salt water , planning to entrap the Allies and destroy them by epidemic .",

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion .

This was the largest carrier-to-carrier battle in history , involving 24 aircraft carriers , deploying roughly 1,350 carrier-based aircraft . The aerial part of the battle was nicknamed the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot by American aviators for the severely disproportional loss ratio inflicted upon Japanese aircraft by American pilots and anti-aircraft gunners . During a debriefing after the first two air battles , a pilot from USS Lexington remarked Why , hell , it was just like an old-time turkey shoot down home !

  "/wiki/Cornell_University": "Cornell University ( /k\u0254\u02d0r\u02c8n\u025bl/ kor-NEL ) is a private and statutory Ivy League research university in Ithaca , New York . Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White , the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge - from the classics to the sciences , and from the theoretical to the applied . These ideals , unconventional for the time , are captured in Cornell 's founding principle , a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation : I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study . The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus , with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy . The university also administers two satellite medical campuses , one in New York City and one in Education City , Qatar , and Cornell Tech , a graduate program that incorporates technology , business , and creative thinking . The program moved from Google 's Chelsea Building in New York City to its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in September 2017 . Cornell is one of ten private land grant universities in the United States and the only one in New York . [ note 1 ] Of its seven undergraduate colleges , three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York ( SUNY ) system , including its agricultural and human ecology colleges as well as its industrial labor relations school . Of Cornell 's graduate schools , only the veterinary college is state-supported . As a land grant college , Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions .

  "/wiki/Croix_de_guerre_1914\u20131918_(France)": "The Croix de guerre 1914-1918 ( English : War Cross ) is a French military decoration , the first version of the Croix de guerre . It was created to recognize French and allied soldiers who were cited for valorous service during World War I , similar to the British mentioned in dispatches but with multiple degrees equivalent to other nations ' decorations for courage . Soon after the outbreak of World War I , French military officials felt that a new military award had to be created . At that time , the Citation du jour ( Daily Citation ) already existed to acknowledge soldiers , but it was just a sheet of paper . Only the M\u00e9daille Militaire and Legion of Honour were bestowed for courage in the field , due to the numbers now involved , a new decoration was required in earnest . At the end of 1914 , General Bo\u00eblle , Commandant in Chief of the French 4th Army Corps , tried to convince the French administration to create a formal military award . Maurice Barr\u00e8s , the noted writer and parliamentarian for Paris , gave Bo\u00eblle support in his efforts . On 23 December 1914 , the French parliamentarian Georges Bonnefous proposed a legislative bill to create the Croix de la Valeur Militaire ( Cross of Military Valour ) signed by 66 other parliamentarians . \u00c9mile Driant , a parliamentarian who served in the war zone during much of this time , became its natural spokesman when he returned to the legislature . On 18 January 1915 , Driant submitted this bill but the name of the military award was renamed to Croix de guerre ( War Cross ) . After parliamentary discussions , the bill was adopted on 2 April 1915 . World War I began in 1914 and ended in 1918 , so the final name adopted is Croix de guerre 1914-1918 .",

  "/wiki/Operation_Torch": "Operation Torch ( 8-16 November 1942 ) was an Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa during the Second World War . The French colonies in the area were dominated by the Vichy French , formally aligned with Germany but of mixed loyalties . Reports indicated that they might support the Allies . The American General Dwight D. Eisenhower , commanding the operation , planned a three-pronged attack on Casablanca ( Western ) , Oran ( Center ) and Algiers ( Eastern ) , then a rapid move on Tunis . The Western Task Force encountered unexpected resistance and bad weather , but Casablanca , the principal French Atlantic naval base , was captured after a short siege . The Center Task Force suffered some damage to its ships when trying to land in shallow water but the Vichy French ships were sunk or driven off ; Oran surrendered after bombardment by British battleships . The Eastern Task Force met less opposition because the French Resistance had staged a coup in Algiers and the Allies were able to push inland and compel surrender on the first day . The success of Torch caused Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan , commander of the Vichy French forces to order co-operation with the Allies , in return for being retained as High Commissioner , with many other Vichy officials keeping their jobs . Darlan was assassinated soon after and the Free French gradually came to dominate the government .

  "/wiki/Operation_Overlord": "Operation Overlord was the codename for the Battle of Normandy , the Allied operation that launched the successful invasion of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II . The operation was launched on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings ( Operation Neptune , commonly known as D-Day ) . A 1,200-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving more than 5,000 vessels . Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June , and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August . The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 . General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group , which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion . The coast of Normandy of northwestern France was chosen as the site of the invasion , with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed Utah and Omaha , the British at Sword and Gold , and the Canadians at Juno . To meet the conditions expected on the Normandy beachhead , special technology was developed , including two artificial ports called Mulberry harbours and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed Hobart 's Funnies . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , Operation Bodyguard , using both electronic and visual misinformation . This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . F\u00fchrer Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of developing fortifications all along Hitler 's proclaimed Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion . The Allies failed to accomplish their objectives for the first day , but gained a tenuous foothold that they gradually expanded when they captured the port at Cherbourg on 26 June and the city of Caen on 21 July .",

The battle is historically significant as the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other , as well as the first in which the opposing ships neither sighted nor fired directly upon one another . In an attempt to strengthen their defensive position in the South Pacific , the Japanese decided to invade and occupy Port Moresby ( in New Guinea ) and Tulagi ( in the southeastern Solomon Islands ) . The plan to accomplish this was called Operation Mo , and involved several major units of Japan 's Combined Fleet . These included two fleet carriers and a light carrier to provide air cover for the invasion forces . It was under the overall command of Japanese Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue . The U.S. learned of the Japanese plan through signals intelligence , and sent two United States Navy carrier task forces and a joint Australian-U.S. cruiser force to oppose the offensive . These were under the overall command of U.S. Admiral Frank J. Fletcher . On 3-4 May , Japanese forces successfully invaded and occupied Tulagi , although several of their supporting warships were sunk or damaged in surprise attacks by aircraft from the U.S. fleet carrier Yorktown . Now aware of the presence of U.S. carriers in the area , the Japanese fleet carriers advanced towards the Coral Sea with the intention of locating and destroying the Allied naval forces . On the evening of 6 May , the direction chosen for air searches by the opposing commanders brought the two carrier forces to within 70 nmi ( 81 mi ; 130 km ) of each other , unbeknownst to both sides .

  "/wiki/Cold_War": "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies , the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc , after World War II . The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union . The term cold is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers , but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars . The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers , following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 . Whilst the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc generally espoused the economic theories of capitalism and socialism , respectively , the conflict was mostly geopolitical in nature . Each power had a nuclear strategy that discouraged a pre-emptive attack by the other side , on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker - the doctrine of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) . Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment , the struggle for dominance was expressed via psychological warfare , massive propaganda campaigns and espionage , far-reaching embargoes , rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race . The West was led by the United States , a federal republic with a two-party presidential system , as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but economically and politically entwined with a network of authoritarian states , most of which were the Western Bloc 's former colonies . [ A ] The Soviet Union was a self-declared Marxist-Leninist state that had a totalitarian government ultimately led by a committee known as the Politburo . The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) had influence across the Second World . The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world , while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world . As nearly all the colonial states achieved independence in the period 1945-1960 , they became Third World battlefields in the Cold War ."
