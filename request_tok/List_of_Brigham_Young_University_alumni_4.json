  "/wiki/Western_(genre)": "Western is a genre of fiction which tells stories set primarily in the latter half of the 19th century in the American Old West , often centering on the life of a nomadic cowboy or gunfighter armed with a revolver and a rifle who rides a horse . Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear Stetson hats , neckerchief bandannas , vests , spurs , cowboy boots , and buckskins ( alternatively dusters ) . Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys , Native Americans , Spaniards , Mexicans , bandits , lawmen , bounty hunters , outlaws , gamblers , soldiers ( especially mounted cavalry , such as buffalo soldiers ) , and settlers ( farmers , ranchers , and townsfolk ) . The ambience is usually punctuated with a Western music score , including American and Spanish/Mexican folk music such as country , Native American music , New Mexico music , and rancheras . Westerns often stress the harshness of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid , desolate landscape of deserts and mountains . Often , the vast landscape plays an important role , presenting a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West .

  "/wiki/Film": "Film , also called movie or motion picture or ( less widely ) The Seventh Art , is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty or atmosphere , by the means of recorded or programmed [ vague ] moving images , along with sound ( and more rarely ) other sensory stimulations . The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it . The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it , and is not projected ) . Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . They reflect those cultures , and , in turn , affect them . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating - or indoctrinating - citizens . The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved into position to be projected , but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears .",
  "/wiki/Television": "Television ( TV ) , sometimes shortened to tele or telly , is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome ( black and white ) , or in colour , and in two or three dimensions and sound . The term can refer to a television set , a television program ( TV show ) , or the medium of television transmission . Television is a mass medium for advertising , entertainment and news . Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s , but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers . After World War II , an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain , and television sets became commonplace in homes , businesses , and institutions . During the 1950s , television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion . In the mid-1960s , color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries . The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes , high-capacity hard disk drives , DVDs , flash drives , high-definition Blu-ray Discs , and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material - such as movies - at home on their own time schedule . For many reasons , especially the convenience of remote retrieval , the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud . At the end of the first decade of the 2000s , digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity . Another development was the move from standard-definition television ( SDTV ) ( 576i , with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i ) to high-definition television ( HDTV ) , which provides a resolution that is substantially higher . HDTV may be transmitted in various formats : 1080p , 1080i and 720p .",
  "/wiki/Actor": "An actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance ( also actress ; see below ) . The actor performs in the flesh in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film , radio , and television .

The actor 's interpretation of their role - the art of acting - pertains to the role played , whether based on a real person or fictional character . Interpretation occurs even when the actor is playing themselves , as in some forms of experimental performance art . Formerly , in ancient Greece and Rome , the medieval world , and the time of William Shakespeare , only men could become actors , and women 's roles were generally played by men or boys . After the English Restoration of 1660 , women began to appear on stage in England . In modern times , particularly in pantomime and some operas , women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men .",

Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the budget . There are many pathways to becoming a film director . Some film directors started as screenwriters , cinematographers , producers , film editors or actors . Other film directors have attended a film school . Directors use different approaches .

  "/wiki/Film_producer": "A film producer is a person who oversees film production . Either employed by a production company or working independently , producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production , such as selecting the script ; coordinating writing , directing , and editing ; and arranging financing . During the discovery stage , the producer finds and selects promising material for development . Then , unless the film is based on an existing script , the producer has to hire a screenwriter and oversee the development of the script . Once a script is completed , the producer will lead a pitch to secure the financial backing ( a green light ) to allow production to begin . The producer also supervises the pre-production , production , and post-production stages of filmmaking . One of the most important tasks is to hire the director and other key crew members . Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production , the producer typically manages the logistics and business operations , though some directors also produce their own films . The producer is tasked with making sure the film is delivered on time and within budget , and has the final say on creative decisions .

After their parents ' death in a fire , the children are placed in the custody of a murderous relative , Count Olaf , who attempts to steal their inheritance and , later , orchestrates numerous disasters with the help of his accomplices as the children attempt to flee . As the plot progresses , the Baudelaires gradually confront further mysteries surrounding their family and deep conspiracies involving a secret society known as V.F.D. , with connections to Olaf , their parents , and many other relatives . The series is narrated by Lemony Snicket , who dedicates each of his works to his deceased love interest , Beatrice , and often attempts to dissuade the reader from reading the Baudelaires ' story . Characterized by Victorian Gothic tones and absurdist textuality , the books are noted for their dark humor , sarcastic storytelling , and anachronistic elements , as well as frequent cultural and literary allusions . They have been classified as postmodern and metafictional writing , with the plot evolution throughout the later novels being cited as an exploration of the psychological process of transition from the idyllic innocence of childhood to the moral complexity of maturity . Likewise , the final installments of the series are also acknowledged for their escalatingly intricate ethical ambiguity toward philosophical ambivalence , as the nature of some of the Baudelaires ' actions becomes increasingly harder to discern from those of their antagonist counterparts and more characters are revealed to be responsible for permanent wrongdoing , despite their identification with the self-proclaimed good side of the tale . Since the release of the first novel , The Bad Beginning , in September 1999 , the books have gained significant popularity , critical acclaim , and commercial success worldwide , spawning a film , a video game , assorted merchandise and a television series on Netflix . The main thirteen books in the series have collectively sold more than 60 million copies and have been translated into 41 languages . Several companion books set in the same universe of the series have also been released , including Lemony Snicket : The Unauthorized Autobiography , The Beatrice Letters and the noir prequel tetralogy All the Wrong Questions , which chronicles Snicket 's childhood .",

Some liberal arts colleges in the United States offer only the BA , even in the natural sciences , while some universities offer only the BS , even in non-science fields . At universities that offer both BA and BS degrees in the same discipline , the BS degree is usually more extensive in that particular discipline and is targeted toward students who are pursuing graduate school or a profession in that field .",
