  "/wiki/Varieties_of_English": "Dialects are linguistic varieties which may differ in pronunciation , vocabulary , spelling and grammar . For the classification of varieties of English in terms of pronunciation only , see Regional accents of English . Dialects can be defined as sub-forms of languages which are , in general , mutually comprehensible . English speakers from different countries and regions use a variety of different accents ( systems of pronunciation ) , as well as various localized words and grammatical constructions ; many different dialects can be identified based on these factors . Dialects can be classified at broader or narrower levels : within a broad national or regional dialect , various more localized sub-dialects can be identified , and so on . The combination of differences in pronunciation and use of local words may make some English dialects almost unintelligible to speakers from other regions . The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into three general categories : the British Isles dialects , those of North America , and those of Australasia . Dialects can be associated not only with place , but also with particular social groups . Within a given English-speaking country , there will often be a form of the language considered to be Standard English - the Standard Englishes of different countries differ , and can themselves be considered dialects . Standard English is often associated with the more educated layers of society , as well as more formal registers . British and American English are the reference norms for English as spoken , written , and taught in the rest of the world , excluding countries where English is spoken natively such as Australia , Canada , Ireland and New Zealand . In many former British Empire countries where English is not spoken natively , British English forms are closely followed , alongside numerous AmE usages which have become widespread throughout the English-speaking world .",

  "/wiki/American_English": "American English ( AmE , AE , AmEng , USEng , en-US [ note 2 ] ) , sometimes called United States English or U.S. English , is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States . American English is a particularly influential form of English worldwide . English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the de facto common language used by the federal and state governments , to the extent that all laws and compulsory education presume English as the primary language . English is explicitly given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments . While the local courts in some divisions of the United States grant equivalent status to both English and another language - for example , English and Spanish in Puerto Rico - under federal law , English is still the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory . The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization of the Americas . The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century , followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries . During the 17th century , dialects from many different regions of England existed in every American colony , allowing a process of extensive dialect mixture and levelling in which English varieties across the colonies became more homogeneous compared with varieties in England . English thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the 17th century 's first massive immigrations of non-English speakers from Europe and Africa , and firsthand descriptions of a fairly uniform American English became common after the mid-18th century . Since then , American English has developed into some new varieties , including regional dialects that , in some cases , show minor influences in the last two centuries from successive waves of immigrant speakers of diverse languages , primarily European languages . American English varieties include many patterns of pronunciation , vocabulary , grammar , and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other English dialects around the world . Any American or Canadian accent perceived as free of noticeably local , ethnic , or cultural markers is popularly called General or Standard American , a fairly uniform accent continuum native to certain regions of the U.S. and associated nationally with broadcast mass media and highly educated speech .",

  "/wiki/Medicine": "Medicine is the science and practice of establishing the diagnosis , prognosis , treatment , and prevention of disease . Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness . Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research , genetics , and medical technology to diagnose , treat , and prevent injury and disease , typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy , external splints and traction , medical devices , biologics , and ionizing radiation , amongst others . Medicine has been around for thousands of years , during most of which it was an art ( an area of skill and knowledge ) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture . For example , a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing , or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism . In recent centuries , since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science ( both basic and applied , under the umbrella of medical science ) . While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice , the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science . Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine , though they do not fall within the modern definition of medicine which is based in medical science . Traditional medicine and folk medicine remain commonly used with , or instead of , scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine",

Access to health care may vary across countries , communities , and individuals , influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes . Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations ( such as insurance coverage ) , geographic barriers ( such as additional transportation costs , possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services ) , and personal limitations ( lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers , poor health literacy , low income ) . Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services , efficacy of treatments , and overall outcome ( well-being , mortality rates ) . Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism , a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies .

  "/wiki/Psychology": "Psychology is the science of behavior and mind . Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena , as well as feeling and thought . It is an academic discipline of immense scope . Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains , and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties , joining this way the broader neuroscientific group of researchers . As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases . In this field , a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social , behavioral , or cognitive scientist . Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior , while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors . Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes , including perception , cognition , attention , emotion , intelligence , subjective experiences , motivation , brain functioning , and personality . This extends to interaction between people , such as interpersonal relationships , including psychological resilience , family resilience , and other areas . Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind . Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables .

  "/wiki/Science": "Science ( from the Latin word scientia , meaning knowledge ) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe . The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE . Their contributions to mathematics , astronomy , and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity , whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries ( 400 to 1000 CE ) of the Middle Ages but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age . The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy , which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions . The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape ; along with the changing of natural philosophy to natural science . Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences ( e.g. , biology , chemistry , and physics ) , which study nature in the broadest sense ; the social sciences ( e.g. , economics , psychology , and sociology ) , which study individuals and societies ; and the formal sciences ( e.g. , logic , mathematics , and theoretical computer science ) , which study abstract concepts . There is disagreement , however , on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence . Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes , such as engineering and medicine , are described as applied sciences . Science is based on research , which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies . The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products , armaments , health care , and environmental protection .",

  "/wiki/Canadian_English": "Canadian English ( CanE , CE , en-CA ) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada . According to the 2016 census , English was the first language of more than 19.4 million Canadians , or 58.1% of the total population ; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French ( 20.8% ) or other languages , at 21.1% ) . A larger number , 28 million people , reported using English as their dominant language . Of Canadians outside the province of Quebec , 82% reported speaking English natively , but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French . Canadian English contains major elements of both British English and American English , as well as many uniquely Canadian characteristics . While , broadly speaking , Canadian English tends to be closest to American English in terms of linguistic distance , the precise influence of American English , British English and other sources on Canadian English varieties has been the ongoing focus of systematic studies since the 1950s . Phonologically , Canadian and American English are classified together as North American English , emphasizing the fact that the vast majority of outsiders , even other native English speakers , can not distinguish the typical accents of the two countries by sound alone . There are minor disagreements over the degree to which even Canadians and Americans themselves can differentiate their own two accents , and there is even evidence that some Western American English ( Pacific Northwest and California English , for example ) is undergoing a vowel shift partially coinciding with a vowel shift occurring in mainland Canadian English , first reported in the early 1990s .",
