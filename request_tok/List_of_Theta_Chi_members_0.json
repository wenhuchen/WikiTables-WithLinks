The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress . Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin .

  "/wiki/Brigadier_General": "Brigadier general ( Brig . Gen. ) or brigade general is a senior rank in the armed forces . It is the lowest ranking general officer in some countries , usually sitting between the ranks of colonel and major general . When appointed to a field command , a brigadier general is typically in command of a brigade consisting of around 4,000 troops ( four battalions ) . In some countries a brigadier general is informally designated as a one-star general ( OF-6 ) . In some countries , this rank is given the name of brigadier , which is usually equivalent to brigadier general in the armies of nations that use the rank . The rank can be traced back to the militaries of Europe where a brigadier general , or simply a brigadier , would command a brigade in the field . The rank name g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade ( which translates as brigade general ) was first used in the French revolutionary armies . In the first quarter of the 20th century , British and Commonwealth armies used the rank of brigadier general as a temporary appointment , or as an honorary appointment on retirement ; in the 1920s this practice changed to the use of brigadier , which was not classed as a general officer . Some armies , such as Taiwan and Japan , use major general as the equivalent of brigadier general ( See also Japan & Taiwan for details. ) . Some of these armies then use the rank of colonel general to make four general-officer ranks . [ citation needed ] Mexico uses the ranks of both General brigadier and General de brigada .",
  "/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Medal_(U.S._Army)": "The Distinguished Service Medal ( DSM ) is a military award of the United States Army that is presented to any person who , while serving in any capacity with the United States military , has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility . The performance must be such as to merit recognition for service that is clearly exceptional . Exceptional performance of normal duty will not alone justify an award of this decoration . Separate Distinguished Service Medals exist for the different branches of the military as well as a fifth version of the medal which is a senior award of the United States Department of Defense . The army version of the Distinguished Service Medal is typically referred to simply as the Distinguished Service Medal , while the other branches of service use the service name as a prefix . For service not related to actual war , the term duty of a great responsibility applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war , and requires evidence of conspicuously significant achievement . However , justification of the award may accrue by virtue of exceptionally meritorious service in a succession of high positions of great importance . Awards may be made to persons other than members of the United States Armed Forces for wartime services only , and then only under exceptional circumstances , with the express approval of the president in each case .",

  "/wiki/First_Transcontinental_Railroad": "The First Transcontinental Railroad ( known originally as the Pacific Railroad and later as the Overland Route ) was a 1,912-mile ( 3,077 km ) continuous railroad line constructed between 1863 and 1869 that connected the existing eastern U.S. rail network at Council Bluffs , Iowa with the Pacific coast at the Oakland Long Wharf on San Francisco Bay . The rail line was built by three private companies over public lands provided by extensive US land grants . Construction was financed by both state and US government subsidy bonds as well as by company issued mortgage bonds . [ N 1 ] The Western Pacific Railroad Company built 132 mi ( 212 km ) of track from the road 's western terminus at Alameda/Oakland to Sacramento , California . The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California ( CPRR ) constructed 690 mi ( 1,110 km ) eastward from Sacramento to Promontory Summit , Utah Territory . The Union Pacific built 1,085 mi ( 1,746 km ) from the road 's eastern terminus at Council Bluffs near Omaha , Nebraska westward to Promontory Summit . The railroad opened for through traffic between Sacramento and Omaha on May 10 , 1869 , when CPRR President Leland Stanford ceremonially tapped the gold Last Spike ( later often referred to as the Golden Spike ) with a silver hammer at Promontory Summit . In the following six months , the last leg from Sacramento to San Francisco Bay was completed . The resulting coast-to-coast railroad connection revolutionized the settlement and economy of the American West . It brought the western states and territories into alignment with the northern Union states and made transporting passengers and goods coast-to-coast considerably quicker , safer and less expensive . Paddle steamers linked Sacramento to the cities and their harbor facilities in the San Francisco Bay until late 1869 , when the CPRR completed and opened the Western Pacific portion ( which the CPRR had acquired control of in 1867-68 [ N 2 ] [ N 3 ] ) to Alameda first and then to Oakland . The first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad 's original western terminus at the Alameda Terminal on September 6 , 1869 , where they transferred to the steamer Alameda for transport across the Bay to San Francisco .",

  "/wiki/Lieutenant_General": "Lieutenant general , lieutenant-general and similar ( abbrev Lt Gen , LTG and similar ) is a three-star military rank ( NATO code OF-8 ) used in many countries . The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages , where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield , who was normally subordinate to a captain general . In modern armies , lieutenant general normally ranks immediately below general and above major general ; it is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air marshal . A lieutenant general commands an army corps , made up of typically three army divisions , and consisting of around 60,000-70,000 soldiers ( U.S. ) . The seeming incongruity that a lieutenant general outranks a major general ( whereas a major outranks a lieutenant ) is due to the derivation of the former rank from sergeant major general , which was also subordinate to lieutenant general . In some countries ( e.g . France and Italy ) , the ranks of corps general or lieutenant colonel general are used instead of lieutenant general , in an attempt to solve this apparent anomaly - these ranks are often translated into English as lieutenant general . [ citation needed ] However , some countries of Latin America such as Brazil and Chile use divisional general as the equivalent of lieutenant general . In addition , because no brigadier general rank is used in Japan , lieutenant general is the rank of divisional commander . Therefore , it corresponds to divisional general of these countries . In a number of smaller states which employ NATO and western style military organizational structures , because of the limited number of soldiers in their armies , the rank of lieutenant general is the highest army rank in use . In Latvia , Lithuania and Singapore , the chief of defence is a lieutenant general , and in the Irish Defence Forces and Israel Defense Forces , the Chief of Staff holds this rank .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Corps": "The United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) was the aerial warfare service component of the United States Army between 1926 and 1941 . After World War I , as early aviation became an increasingly important part of modern warfare , a philosophical rift developed between more traditional ground-based army personnel and those who felt that aircraft were being underutilized and that air operations were being stifled for political reasons unrelated to their effectiveness . The USAAC was renamed from the earlier United States Army Air Service on 2 July 1926 , and was part of the larger United States Army . The Air Corps became the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) on 20 June 1941 , giving it greater autonomy from the Army 's middle-level command structure . During World War II , although not an administrative echelon , the Air Corps ( AC ) remained as one of the combat arms of the Army until 1947 , when it was legally abolished by legislation establishing the Department of the Air Force . The Air Corps was renamed by the United States Congress largely as a compromise between the advocates of a separate air arm and those of the traditionalist Army high command who viewed the aviation arm as an auxiliary branch to support the ground forces . Although its members worked to promote the concept of air power and an autonomous air force in the years between the world wars , its primary purpose by Army policy remained support of ground forces rather than independent operations . On 1 March 1935 , still struggling with the issue of a separate air arm , the Army activated the General Headquarters Air Force for centralized control of aviation combat units within the continental United States , separate from but coordinate with the Air Corps . The separation of the Air Corps from control of its combat units caused problems of unity of command that became more acute as the Air Corps enlarged in preparation for World War II . This was resolved by the creation of the Army Air Forces ( AAF ) , making both organizations subordinate to the new higher echelon . On June 20 , 1941 , the Army Air Corps ' existence as the primary air arm of the U.S. Army changed to that of solely being the training and logistics elements of the then-new United States Army Air Forces , which embraced the formerly-named General Headquarters Air Force under the new Air Force Combat Command organization for front-line combat operations ; this new element , along with the Air Corps , comprised the USAAF . The Air Corps ceased to have an administrative structure after 9 March 1942 , but as the permanent statutory organization of the air arm , and the principal component of the Army Air Forces , the overwhelming majority of personnel assigned to the AAF were members of the Air Corps .",

Around 13,100 American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions made night parachute drops early on D-Day , June 6 , followed by 3,937 glider troops flown in by day . As the opening maneuver of Operation Neptune ( the assault operation for Overlord ) the two American airborne divisions were delivered to the continent in two parachute and six glider missions . The divisions were part of the U.S. VII Corps and provided it with support in its mission of capturing Cherbourg as soon as possible to provide the Allies with a port of supply . The specific missions of the two airborne divisions were to block approaches into the vicinity of the amphibious landing at Utah Beach , to capture causeway exits off the beaches , and to establish crossings over the Douve River at Carentan to assist the U.S. V Corps in merging the two U.S. beachheads . The assault did not succeed in blocking the approaches to Utah for three days . Numerous factors played a part , most of which dealt with excessive scattering of the drops .

It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in eastern Belgium , northeast France , and Luxembourg , towards the end of the war in Europe . The offensive was intended to stop Allied use of the Belgian port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines , allowing the Germans to encircle and destroy four Allied armies and force the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis powers ' favor . The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944 , due to a combination of Allied overconfidence , preoccupation with Allied offensive plans , and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather . American forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war . The battle also severely depleted Germany 's armored forces , and they were largely unable to replace them . German personnel and , later , Luftwaffe aircraft ( in the concluding stages of the engagement ) also sustained heavy losses . The Germans had attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line , taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies ' overwhelmingly superior air forces . Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive , around Elsenborn Ridge , and in the south , around Bastogne , blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success . Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads . This , and terrain that favored the defenders , threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops . The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame , south east of Dinant , being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944 .",
