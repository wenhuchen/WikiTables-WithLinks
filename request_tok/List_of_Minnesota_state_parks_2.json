  "/wiki/Open-pit_mining": "Open-pit , open-cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow . This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth , such as long wall mining . Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface . It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling ( as would be the case for sand , cinder , and gravel ) . In contrast , minerals that have been found underground but are difficult to retrieve due to hard rock , can be reached using a form of underground mining . To create an open-pit mine , the miners must determine the information of the ore that is underground . This is done through drilling of probe holes in the ground , then plotting each hole location on a map . The information gained through the holes with provide an idea of the vertical extent of the ore 's body . This vertical information is then used to pit tentative locations of the benches that will occur in the mine . It is important to consider the grade and economic value of the ore in the potential pit . Open-pit mines that produce building materials and dimension stone are commonly referred to as quarries . Open-pit mines are typically enlarged until either the mineral resource is exhausted , or an increasing ratio of overburden to ore makes further mining uneconomic .",
  "/wiki/Mountain_biking": "Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road , often over rough terrain , using specially designed mountain bikes . Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain . Mountain biking can generally be broken down into multiple categories : cross country , trail riding , all mountain ( also referred to as Enduro ) , downhill , freeride and dirt jumping . This sport requires endurance , core strength and balance , bike handling skills , and self-reliance . Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs . In the case of freeride , downhill , and dirt jumping , aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps . Mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack , back-country roads , wider bike park trails , fire roads , and some advanced trails are designed with jumps , berms , and drop-off to add excitement to the trail . Riders with enduro and downhill bikes will often visit ski resorts that stay open in the summer to ride downhill specific trails , using the ski lifts to return to the top with their bikes . Because riders are often far from civilization , there is a strong ethic of self-reliance in the sport . Riders learn to repair broken bikes and flat tires to avoid being stranded . Many riders carry a backpack , including water , food , tools for trailside repairs , and a first aid kit in case of injury . Group rides are common , especially on longer treks .",

The area was a bustling fur trading station since the 1700s , and the French Canadian Voyageurs termed the settled village Grand Marais which is French for Great Marsh , referring to a marsh that , in early fur-trading times , was 20 acres ( 8.1 ha ) or less in area , nearly at the level of Lake Superior , and situated at the head of the little bay and harbor that led to the settlement of the village there .

Ecologically , the Driftless Area 's flora and fauna are more closely related to those of the Great Lakes region and New England than those of the broader Midwest and central Plains regions . Colloquially , the term includes the incised Paleozoic Plateau of southeastern Minnesota and northeastern Iowa . The region includes elevations ranging from 603 to 1,719 feet ( 184 to 524 m ) at Blue Mound State Park and covers 24,000 square miles ( 62,200 km2 ) . The rugged terrain is due both to the lack of glacial deposits , or drift , and to the incision of the upper Mississippi River and its tributaries into bedrock . An alternative , less restrictive definition of the Driftless Area includes the sand Plains region northeast of Wisconsin 's portion of the incised Paleozoic Plateau in the southwestern part of the state . This part of the Driftless Area in the southwestern section of Wisconsin 's Central Plain also lacks evidence of glaciation ( although it was modified by glacial meltwaters that collected in Glacial Lake Wisconsin ) , and contains many isolated hills , bluffs , mesas , buttes , and pinnacles that are outlying eroded Cambrian bedrock remnants of the plateau to the southwest .",
