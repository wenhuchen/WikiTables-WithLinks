  "/wiki/Argentina": "Argentina ( Spanish : [ a\u027exen\u02c8tina ] ) , officially the Argentine Republic [ A ] ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica Argentina ) , is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America . Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

  "/wiki/Treason": "In law , treason is criminal disloyalty , typically to the state . It is a crime that covers some of the more extreme acts against one 's nation or sovereign . This usually includes things such as participating in a war against one 's native country , attempting to overthrow its government , spying on its military , its diplomats , or its secret services for a hostile and foreign power , or attempting to kill its head of state . A person who commits treason is known in law as a traitor . Historically , in common law countries , treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors , such as the murder of a husband by his wife or that of a master by his servant . Treason against the king was known as high treason and treason against a lesser superior was petty treason . As jurisdictions around the world abolished petty treason , treason came to refer to what was historically known as high treason . At times , the term traitor has been used as a political epithet , regardless of any verifiable treasonable action . In a civil war or insurrection , the winners may deem the losers to be traitors . Likewise the term traitor is used in heated political discussion - typically as a slur against political dissidents , or against officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents . In certain cases , as with the Dolchsto\u00dflegende ( Stab-in-the-back myth ) , the accusation of treason towards a large group of people can be a unifying political message .",
  "/wiki/Shooting": "Shooting is the act or process of discharging a projectile from a ranged weapon ( such as a gun , slingshot , crossbow , or bow ) . Even the acts of launching/discharging artillery , darts , grenades , rockets and guided missiles can be considered acts of shooting . When using a firearm , the act of shooting is often called firing as it involves initiating a combustion process ( deflagration ) . Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field , in shooting sports , hunting or in combat . The person involved in the shooting activity is called a shooter . A skilled , accurate shooter is a marksman or sharpshooter , and a person 's level of shooting proficiency is referred to as their marksmanship .",

Spanish is the official and predominant language , although 36 indigenous languages also have official status , of which the most commonly spoken are Guarani , Aymara and Quechua languages . Before Spanish colonization , the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the Inca Empire , while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes . Spanish conquistadors arriving from Cuzco and Asunci\u00f3n took control of the region in the 16th century .",
  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",

It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro .

  "/wiki/Hanging": "Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck . The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck , though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain hanging . Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times , and is the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions . The first known account of execution by hanging was in Homer 's Odyssey ( Book XXII ) . In this specialised meaning of the common word hang , the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung . Hanging is also a common method of suicide in which a person applies a ligature to the neck and brings about unconsciousness and then death by suspension or partial suspension .",

Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) of Antarctica under the Chilean Antarctic Territory . [ nb 3 ] , The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper and lithium . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia .

It is bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest , Brazil to the east and northeast , and Bolivia to the northwest . Although it is one of only two landlocked countries in South America ( the other is Bolivia ) , the country has coasts , beaches and ports on the Paraguay and Paran\u00e1 rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay Waterway . Due to its central location in South America , it is sometimes referred to as Coraz\u00f3n de Sudam\u00e9rica ( Heart of South America ) . Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the R\u00edo de la Plata to the Paran\u00e1 River , and finally up the Paraguay River . In 1537 , they established the city of Asunci\u00f3n , which was the first capital of the Governorate of Paraguay and R\u00edo de la Plata . Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions , where the Guaran\u00ed people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions , mainly during the 17th century . However , after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish territories in 1767 , Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony , with few urban centers and settlers . Following independence from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century , Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist , isolationist and protectionist policies . This period ended with the disastrous Paraguayan War , during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25-33% of its territory to the Triple Alliance of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay . In the 20th century , Paraguay faced another major international conflict - the Chaco War - against Bolivia , from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious . Afterwards , the country entered a period of military dictatorships , ending with the 35 year regime of Alfredo Stroessner that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup .",

The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent . Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017 .",
  "/wiki/Espionage": "Espionage or spying is the act of obtaining secret or confidential information or divulging of the same without the permission of the holder of the information . Spies help agencies uncover secret information . Any individual or spy ring ( a cooperating group of spies ) , in the service of a government , company or independent operation , can commit espionage . The practice is clandestine , as it is by definition unwelcome . In some circumstances it may be a legal tool of law enforcement and in others it may be illegal and punishable by law . Espionage is a method of gathering which includes information gathering from non-disclosed sources . Espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern . However , the term tends to be associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for military purposes . Spying involving corporations is known as industrial espionage .

  "/wiki/Firing_squad": "Execution by firing squad , in the past sometimes called fusillading ( from the French fusil , rifle ) , is a method of capital punishment , particularly common in the military and in times of war . Execution by shooting is a fairly old practice . Some reasons for its use are that firearms are usually readily available and a gunshot to a vital organ , such as brain or heart , usually kills relatively quickly . A firing squad is normally composed of several military personnel . Usually , all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously , thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot . To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head , the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart , sometimes aided by a paper target . The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded , as well as restrained , although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered . Media portrayals have frequently shown condemned being offered a final cigarette as well . Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting . There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light or at sunrise . This gave rise to the phrase shot at dawn . Execution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms , such as an execution by shooting to the back of the head or neck .",

Suriname was long inhabited by various indigenous people before being invaded and contested by European powers from the 16th century , eventually coming under Dutch rule in the late 17th century . As the chief sugar colony during the Dutch colonial period , it was primarily a plantation economy dependent on African slaves and , following the abolition of slavery in 1863 , indentured servants from Asia . Suriname was ruled by the Dutch-chartered company Society of Suriname between 1683 and 1795 . In 1954 , Suriname became one of the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands .

It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century , with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics . A series of economic crises put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century , culminating in a 1973 coup , which established a civic-military dictatorship . The military government persecuted leftists , socialists , and political opponents , resulting in several deaths and numerous instances of torture by the military ; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985 . Uruguay is today a democratic constitutional republic , with a president who serves as both head of state and head of government . Uruguay is ranked first in Latin America in democracy , peace , low perception of corruption , e-government , and is first in South America when it comes to press freedom , size of the middle class and prosperity ."
