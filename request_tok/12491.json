  "/wiki/Six_Flags_AstroWorld": "Six Flags AstroWorld or AstroWorld was a seasonally operated theme park located in Houston , Texas . Owned and operated by Six Flags , it was located on approximately 57 acres ( 23 ha ) of land , which was later expanded to over 75 acres ( 30 ha ) between Kirby Drive and Fannin Avenue , directly south of Loop 610 in Houston . Part of the Six Flags Houston complex , the park also included Six Flags WaterWorld , a water park that was adjacent to the main park . The park opened on June 1 , 1968 , and was originally developed and constructed as part of the Astrodomain , the brainchild of local philanthropist and former Houston mayor Judge Roy Hofheinz , who intended it to complement The Astrodome . AstroWorld was sold to the Six Flags Corporation by the Hofheinz family in 1975 . Although it was the fourth theme park to be included in the Six Flags family , it was the first to be acquired by that company rather than built from the ground up . Initially , it was marketed as AstroWorld : A Member of the Six Flags Family so as to not confuse patrons with Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington . AstroWorld was permanently closed by Six Flags , Inc. after its final day of operations on October 30 , 2005 , the final night of Fright Fest 2005 . Shortly after , it began to be demolished , which lasted through the first half of 2006 , though parts of WaterWorld were already being demolished prior to the final operating day at AstroWorld . The Loop 610 bridge crossing from the park to the parking lot continues to stand and is the last remaining structure from AstroWorld . The area where AstroWorld once stood is now just grassland , and is used for overflow parking during the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo .",
