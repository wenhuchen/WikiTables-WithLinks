  "/wiki/Geography_of_Cyprus": "Cyprus is an island in the Eastern Basin of the Mediterranean Sea . It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean , after the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia , and the 80th largest island in the world by area . It is located south of the Anatolian peninsula , so it may be included in Western Asia or the Middle East : Cyprus is close to Southern Europe , and Northern Africa , and has had lengthy periods of mainly Greek and intermittent Anatolian , Levantine , Byzantine , Turkish , and Western European influence . The island is dominated by two mountain ranges , the Troodos Mountains and the Kyrenia Mountains or Pentadaktylos , and the central plain , the Mesaoria , between them . The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area . The narrow Kyrenia Range extends along the northern coastline . It is not as high as the Troodos Mountains , and it occupies substantially less area . The two mountain ranges run generally parallel to the Taurus Mountains on the Turkish mainland , the outlines of which are visible from northern Cyprus . Coastal lowlands , varying in width , surround the island . Geopolitically , the island is divided into four segments . The Republic of Cyprus , the only internationally recognized government , occupies the southern 60% of the island , and has been a member state of the European Union since 1 May 2004 . The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus , is diplomatically recognized only by Turkey , occupies the northern one-third of the island , around 36% of the territory .",
  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region . The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies . The countries surrounding the Mediterranean in clockwise order are Spain , France , Monaco , Italy , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro , Albania , Greece , Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Israel , Egypt , Libya , Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco ; Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea .

In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved .

The Falkland Islands ' capital is Stanley on East Falkland . Controversy exists over the Falklands ' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans . At various times , the islands have had French , British , Spanish , and Argentine settlements . Britain reasserted its rule in 1833 , but Argentina maintains its claim to the islands . In April 1982 , Argentine military forces invaded the islands . British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War . Almost all Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory . Its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/Gibraltar": "Gibraltar ( /d\u0292\u026a\u02c8br\u0254\u02d0lt\u0259r/ jih-BRAWL-t\u0259r , Spanish : [ xi\u03b2\u027eal\u02c8ta\u027e ] ) is a British Overseas Territory located at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula . It has an area of 6.7 km2 ( 2.6 sq mi ) and is bordered to the north by Spain . The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar at the foot of which is a densely populated town area , home to over 32,000 people , primarily Gibraltarians . In 1704 , Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne . The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . During World War II it was an important base for the Royal Navy as it controlled the entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea , the Strait of Gibraltar , which is only 14.3 km ( 8.9 mi ) wide at this naval choke point . It remains strategically important , with half the world 's seaborne trade passing through the strait . Today Gibraltar 's economy is based largely on tourism , online gambling , financial services and cargo ship refuelling . The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations because Spain asserts a claim to the territory . Gibraltarians rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum and , in a 2002 referendum , the idea of shared sovereignty was also rejected .",

  "/wiki/Continental_Europe": "Continental or mainland Europe is the contiguous continent of Europe , excluding its surrounding islands . It can also be referred to ambiguously as the European continent - which can conversely mean the whole of Europe - and by some , simply the Continent . The most common definition of continental Europe excludes continental islands , encompassing the Greek Islands , Cyprus , Malta , Sicily , Sardinia , Corsica , the Balearic Islands , Great Britain and Ireland and surrounding islands , Novaya Zemlya and the Nordic archipelago , as well as nearby oceanic islands , including the Canary Islands , Madeira , the Azores , Iceland , the Faroe Islands , and Svalbard . The Scandinavian Peninsula is sometimes also excluded , as even though it is technically part of mainland Europe , the de facto connections to the rest of the continent are across the Baltic Sea or North Sea ( rather than via the lengthy land route that involves travelling to the north of the peninsula where it meets Finland , and then south through north-east Europe ) . The old notion of Europe as a cultural and European unification term was centred on core Europe ( Kerneuropa ) , the continental territory of the historical Carolingian Empire , corresponding to modern France , Italy , Germany ( or German-speaking Europe ) and the Benelux states ( historical Austrasia ) .",
  "/wiki/Montserrat": "Montserrat ( /\u02ccm\u0252nts\u0259\u02c8r\u00e6t/ MONT-s\u0259-RAT ) is a British Overseas Territory ( BOT ) in the Caribbean . The island is in the Leeward Islands , which is part of the chain known as the Lesser Antilles , in the West Indies . Montserrat measures approximately 16 km ( 10 mi ) in length and 11 km ( 7 mi ) in width , with approximately 40 km ( 25 mi ) of coastline . Montserrat is nicknamed The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean both for its resemblance to coastal Ireland and for the Irish ancestry of many of its inhabitants . On 18 July 1995 , the previously dormant Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano , in the southern part of the island , became active . Eruptions destroyed Montserrat 's Georgian era capital city of Plymouth . Between 1995 and 2000 , two-thirds of the island 's population was forced to flee , primarily to the United Kingdom , leaving fewer than 1,200 people on the island in 1997 ( rising to nearly 5,000 by 2016 ) . The volcanic activity continues , mostly affecting the vicinity of Plymouth , including its docking facilities , and the eastern side of the island around the former W. H. Bramble Airport , the remnants of which were buried by flows from volcanic activity on 11 February 2010 . An exclusion zone , encompassing the southern half of the island to as far north as parts of the Belham Valley , was imposed because of the size of the existing volcanic dome and the resulting potential for pyroclastic activity . Visitors are generally not permitted entry into the exclusion zone , but a view of the destruction of Plymouth can be seen from the top of Garibaldi Hill in Isles Bay . Relatively quiet since early 2010 , the volcano continues to be closely monitored by the Montserrat Volcano Observatory . A new town and port are being developed at Little Bay , which is on the northwest coast of the island .",

Constructed on historical lava deposits near the then long-inactive Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano , the town was evacuated in 1995 when the volcano resumed erupting . Plymouth was eventually abandoned permanently in 1997 after it was substantially burnt and mostly buried by a series of pyroclastic flows and lahars . For centuries , it had been the only port of entry to the island . Plymouth is still the de jure capital city of Montserrat , making it the only ghost town that serves as the capital of a political territory .",

After a long period of dormancy , the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano became active in 1995 and has continued to erupt ever since . Its eruptions have rendered more than half of Montserrat uninhabitable , destroying the capital city , Plymouth , and causing widespread evacuations : about two thirds of the population have left the island . It is andesitic in nature , and the current pattern of activity includes periods of lava dome growth , punctuated by brief episodes of dome collapse which result in pyroclastic flows , ash venting , and explosive eruption . The volcano is monitored by the Montserrat Volcano Observatory . Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System , which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas , improving prediction of volcanic activity . The Centre Hills in the central part of the island and the Silver Hills in the north are older volcanic massifs related to the subduction zone .",
