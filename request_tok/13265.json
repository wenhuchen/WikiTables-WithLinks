  "/wiki/Mound_Builders": "The various cultures collectively termed Mound Builders were inhabitants of North America who , during a 5,000-year period , constructed various styles of earthen mounds for religious , ceremonial , burial , and elite residential purposes . These included the pre-Columbian cultures of the Archaic period , Woodland period ( Calusa culture , Adena and Hopewell cultures ) , and Mississippian period ; dating from roughly 3500 BCE ( the construction of Watson Brake ) to the 16th century CE , and living in regions of the Great Lakes , the Ohio River Valley , and the Mississippi River valley and its tributary waters . Since the 19th century , the prevailing scholarly consensus has been that the mounds were constructed by indigenous peoples of the Americas . Sixteenth-century Spanish explorers met natives living in a number of later Mississippian cities , described their cultures , and left artifacts . Research and study of these cultures and peoples has been based mostly on archaeology and anthropology .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing .

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Holt_and_Balcom_Logging_Camp_No._1": "The Holt and Balcom Logging Camp No . 1 in Lakewood , Wisconsin was built around 1880 in what was then timber along McCaslin Brook . It is probably the oldest lumber camp in Wisconsin still standing in its original location , and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 . The Holt-Balcom Lumber Company was organized in 1862 , with headquarters in Chicago . Devillo Holt was a New Yorker who came west to Mackinac Island around 1843 for a job with the American Fur Company , then moved to Chicago in 1847 to operate a lumber yard . Uri Balcom was a lumberman from out east who came to Oconto in 1856 to continue logging . Their 1862 company held timber land in Marinette and Oconto counties and promptly opened a branch office and sawmill in Oconto . At that time much of northeast Wisconsin was still covered with forests of virgin timber , and Holt-Balcom proceeded to cut the white pine logs from the tracts that they owned . By 1880 they had reached McCaslin Brook , a tributary of the Oconto River fifty miles upstream from their sawmill . They built splash dams on the brook , and built the logging camp that is the subject of this article on a rise about 80 feet from the brook . Now the camp looks out across the very domestic McCaslin Brook Golf and Country Club , but in the 1880s it would have been surrounded by wilderness - tall trees and brush .

  "/wiki/Sawmill": "A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber . Modern saw mills use a motorized saw to cut logs lengthwise to make long pieces , and crosswise to length depending on standard or custom sizes ( dimensional lumber ) . The portable saw mill is iconic and of simple operation - the logs lay flat on a steel bed and the motorized saw cuts the log horizontally along the length of the bed , by the operator manually pushing the saw . The most basic kind of saw mill consists of a chainsaw and a customized jig ( Alaskan saw mill ) , with similar horizontal operation . Before the invention of the sawmill , boards were made in various manual ways , either rived ( split ) and planed , hewn , or more often hand sawn by two men with a whipsaw , one above and another in a saw pit below . The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill , a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis , Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD . Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa , the Middle East and Central Asia , and in the next few centuries , spread across Europe . The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade . Generally , only the saw was powered , and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand . An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage , also water powered , to move the log steadily through the saw blade . By the time of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century , the circular saw blade had been invented , and with the development of steam power in the 19th century , a much greater degree of mechanisation was possible . Scrap lumber from the mill provided a source of fuel for firing the boiler .",
  "/wiki/Greek_revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Galvanized_steel": "Hot-dip galvanization is a form of galvanization . It is the process of coating iron and steel with zinc , which alloys with the surface of the base metal when immersing the metal in a bath of molten zinc at a temperature of around 449 \u00b0C ( 840 \u00b0F ) . When exposed to the atmosphere , the pure zinc ( Zn ) reacts with oxygen ( O2 ) to form zinc oxide ( ZnO ) , which further reacts with carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) to form zinc carbonate ( ZnCO3 ) , a usually dull grey , fairly strong material that protects the steel underneath from further corrosion in many circumstances . Galvanized steel is widely used in applications where corrosion resistance is needed without the cost of stainless steel , and is considered superior in terms of cost and life-cycle . It can be identified by the crystallization patterning on the surface ( often called a spangle ) . Galvanized steel can be welded ; however , one must exercise caution around the resulting toxic zinc fumes . Galvanized fumes are released when the galvanized metal reaches a certain temperature . This temperature varies by the galvanization process used . In long-term , continuous exposure , the recommended maximum temperature for hot-dip galvanized steel is 200 \u00b0C ( 392 \u00b0F ) , according to the American Galvanizers Association . The use of galvanized steel at temperatures above this will result in peeling of the zinc at the inter metallic layer [ citation needed ] . Electrogalvanized sheet steel is often used in automotive manufacturing to enhance the corrosion performance of exterior body panels ; this is , however , a completely different process which tends to achieve lower coating thicknesses of zinc . Like other corrosion protection systems , galvanizing protects steel by acting as a barrier between steel and the atmosphere .",
  "/wiki/Fire_tower": "A fire lookout tower , fire tower or lookout tower , provides housing and protection for a person known as a fire lookout whose duty it is to search for wildfires in the wilderness . The fire lookout tower is a small building , usually located on the summit of a mountain or other high vantage point , in order to maximize the viewing distance and range , known as view shed . From this vantage point the fire lookout can see smoke that may develop , determine the location by using a device known as an Osborne Fire Finder , and call fire suppression personnel to the fire . Lookouts also report weather changes and plot the location of lightning strikes during storms . The location of the strike is monitored for a period of days after in case of ignition . The typical fire lookout tower consists of a small room , known as a cab located atop a large steel , or wooden tower . Historically , the tops of tall trees have also been used to mount permanent platforms . Sometimes natural rock may be used to create a lower platform . In cases where the terrain makes a tower unnecessary , the structure is known as a ground cab . Ground cabs are called towers , even if they do n't sit on a tower . Towers gained popularity in the early 1900s , and fires were reported using telephones , carrier pigeons , and heliographs . Although many fire lookout towers have fallen into disrepair as a result of neglect , abandonment , and declining budgets , some fire service personnel have made an effort to preserve older fire towers , arguing that a good set of human eyes watching the forest for wildfire can be an effective and cheap fire safety measure .",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

  "/wiki/Georgian_Revival": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",

The Rocky Mountains stretch 3,000 km ( 1,900 mi ) in straight-line distance from the northernmost part of British Columbia , in western Canada , to New Mexico in the Southwestern United States . The northern terminus is near the Liard River , while the southernmost point is near Albuquerque , adjacent the Sandia-Manzano Mountains . Located within the North American Cordillera , the Rockies are distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges , Cascade Range , and the Sierra Nevada , which all lie farther to the west . The Rocky Mountains formed 80 million to 55 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny , in which a number of plates began sliding underneath the North American plate . The angle of subduction was shallow , resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western North America . Since then , further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers have sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys . At the end of the last ice age , humans began inhabiting the mountain range . After Europeans , such as Sir Alexander Mackenzie , and Americans , such as the Lewis and Clark expedition , began exploring the range , minerals and furs drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains , although the range itself never experienced a dense population . Of the 100 highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains , 78 ( including the 30 highest ) are located in Colorado , ten in Wyoming , six in New Mexico , and three in Montana . Public parks and forest lands protect much of the mountain range , and they are popular tourist destinations , especially for hiking , camping , mountaineering , fishing , hunting , mountain biking , skiing , and snowboarding .",
  "/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States": "The Gulf Coast of the United States is the coastline along the Southern United States where they meet the Gulf of Mexico . The coastal states that have a shoreline on the Gulf of Mexico are Southeast Texas & South Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida , and these are known as the Gulf States . The economy of the Gulf Coast area is dominated by industries related to energy , petrochemicals , fishing , aerospace , agriculture , and tourism . The large cities of the region are ( from west to east ) McAllen , Brownsville , Corpus Christi , Houston , Galveston , Beaumont , Lafayette , Baton Rouge , New Orleans , Gulfport , Biloxi , Mobile , Pensacola , St. Petersburg , Tampa , and increasingly , Sarasota . All are the centers of their respective metropolitan areas and contain large ports . ( Baton Rouge is relatively far from the Gulf of Mexico ; its port is on the Mississippi River , as is the port of New Orleans . )",
  "/wiki/St._Mark's_Episcopal_Church,_Guild_Hall_and_Vicarage": "St. Mark 's Episcopal Church , Guild Hall and Vicarage is a historic Episcopal church complex in Oconto , Wisconsin , with its buildings in architectural styles popular when they were constructed . The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 1 , 1985 for its architectural significance . St. Mark 's church is a Neogothic-styled building designed by A.H. James of Kansas City and built in 1900 . It has walls of limestone with low buttresses on the south side . The front gable end features an apsidiole at the center at ground level , with a rose window above that and above that on the ridge a stone cross .

The frame Guild Hall north of the current church building was built in 1866-67 across the street by the first Methodist congregation in Oconto . Typical of that period , its style is Greek Revival , with returned cornices and tall windows . In 1894 St. Mark 's bought the building and moved it to their site to replace their original building .",
  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 ."
