  "/wiki/Australian_rules_football": "Australian rules football , officially known as Australian football , or simply called Aussie rules , football or footy , is a contact sport played between two teams of eighteen players on an oval-shaped field , often a modified cricket ground . Points are scored by kicking the oval-shaped ball between the middle goal posts ( worth six points ) or between a goal and behind post ( worth one point ) . During general play , players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball . The primary methods are kicking , handballing and running with the ball . There are rules on how the ball can be handled : for example , players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground . Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball . A distinctive feature of the game is the mark , where players anywhere on the field who catch the ball from a kick ( with specific conditions ) are awarded possession . Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid . Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents . Dangerous physical contact ( such as pushing an opponent in the back ) , interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks , distance penalties or suspension for a certain number of matches , depending on the seriousness of the infringement . The game features frequent physical contests , spectacular marking , fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring . The sport 's origins can be traced to football matches played in Melbourne , Victoria in 1858 , inspired by English public school football games .",
