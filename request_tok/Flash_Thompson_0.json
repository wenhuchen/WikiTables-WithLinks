  "/wiki/List_of_Venom_titles": "The various iterations of Venom have appeared as a principal character in a number of limited series , one shots , and ongoing series published by Marvel Comics . With the first issue of the first limited series published at the end of 1992 ( cover dated February 1993 ) , the character appeared in a string of 17 limited series . These series did not overlap in publication ( with the exception of Venom - Deathtrap : The Vault , which was a reprint of another book ) , each having more than a month between the end of one series and the start of the next . With the exception of one shot titles , this resulted in the character appearing as the focal character of a new issue each month through the end of Venom : The Finale , published in November 1997 ( cover dated January 1998 ) , composing the equivalent of a five-year ongoing series from 1992 to 1997 , with other issues and series following that . For most of these issues Eddie Brock has been the main character and host for the Venom symbiote with the exception of Venom vol . 1 , Dark Reign : Sinister Spider-Man , Venom/Deadpool What If ? , and Venom vol . 2 . The Amazing Spider-Man Presents - Anti-Venom : New Ways to Live could also be considered an exception because Eddie Brock is the main character but it is not the original Venom symbiote .",
