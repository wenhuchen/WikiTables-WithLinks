  "/wiki/Ajaeng": "The ajaeng is a Korean string instrument . It is a wide zither with strings made of twisted silk , played by means of a slender stick made of forsythia wood , which is scraped against the strings in the manner of a bow . The original version of the instrument , and that used in court music ( called the jeongak ajaeng ) , has seven strings , while the ajaeng used for sanjo and sinawi ( called the sanjo ajaeng ) has eight strings ; some instruments may have up to nine strings . The ajaeng is generally played while seated on the floor . It has a tone similar to that of a cello , but raspier . Some contemporary players prefer to use an actual horsehair bow rather than a stick , believing the sound to be smoother . The instrument is used in court , aristocratic , and folk music , as well as in contemporary classical music and film scores . The ajaeng is derived from the Chinese yazheng ( simplified : \u8f67\u7b5d ; traditional : \u8ecb\u7b8f ) .",
  "/wiki/Music_of_Korea": "The music of Korea refers to music from the Korean peninsula ranging from prehistoric times to the division of Korea into South and North in 1945 . It includes court music , folk music , poetic songs , and religious music used in shamanistic and Buddhist traditions . Together , traditional Korean music is referred to as gugak ( Hangul : \uad6d\uc545 ) , which literally means national music .",

  "/wiki/Zither": "Zither ( /\u02c8z\u026a\u00f0\u0259r , \u02c8z\u026a\u03b8-/ ; German : [ \u02c8ts\u026at\u0250 ] ) is a class of stringed instruments . The word Zither is a German rendering of the Greek word cithara , from which the modern word guitar also derives . Historically , it has been applied to any instrument of the cittern family , or to an instrument consisting of many strings stretched across a thin , flat body - similar to a psaltery . This article describes the latter variety . Zithers are played by strumming or plucking the strings , either with the fingers ( sometimes using an accessory called a plectrum or pick ) , sounding the strings with a bow , or , with varieties of the instrument like the santur or cimbalom , by beating the strings with specially shaped hammers . Like a guitar or lute , a zither 's body serves as a resonating chamber ( sound box ) , but , unlike guitars and lutes , a zither lacks a distinctly separate neck assembly . The number of strings varies , from one to more than fifty . In modern common usage the term zither refers to three specific instruments : the concert zither ( German : Konzertzither ) , its variant the Alpine zither ( both using a fretted fingerboard ) , and the chord zither ( more recently described as a fretless zither or guitar zither ) . Concert and Alpine zithers are traditionally found in Slovenia , Austria , Hungary , France , north-western Croatia , the southern regions of Germany , alpine Europe , Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Russia , Ukraine and Belarus . Emigration from these areas during the 19th century introduced the concert and Alpine zither to North and South America . Chord zithers similar to the instrument in the photograph also became popular in North America during the late 19th and early 20th century . These variants all use metal strings , similar to the cittern .",
  "/wiki/String_instrument": "String instruments , stringed instruments , or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner . Musicians play some string instruments by plucking the strings with their fingers or a plectrum - and others by hitting the strings with a light wooden hammer or by rubbing the strings with a bow . In some keyboard instruments , such as the harpsichord , the musician presses a key that plucks the string . With bowed instruments , the player pulls a rosined horsehair bow across the strings , causing them to vibrate . With a hurdy-gurdy , the musician cranks a wheel whose rosined edge touches the strings . Bowed instruments include the string section instruments of the Classical music orchestra ( violin , viola , cello and double bass ) and a number of other instruments ( e.g. , viols and gambas used in early music from the Baroque music era and fiddles used in many types of folk music ) . All of the bowed string instruments can also be plucked with the fingers , a technique called pizzicato . A wide variety of techniques are used to sound notes on the electric guitar , including plucking with the fingernails or a plectrum , strumming and even tapping on the fingerboard and using feedback from a loud , distorted guitar amplifier to produce a sustained sound . Some types of string instrument are mainly plucked , such as the harp and the electric bass . In the Hornbostel-Sachs scheme of musical instrument classification , used in organology , string instruments are called chordophones . Other examples include the sitar , rebab , banjo , mandolin , ukulele , and bouzouki . In most string instruments , the vibrations are transmitted to the body of the instrument , which often incorporates some sort of hollow or enclosed area .",
  "/wiki/Strings_(music)": "A string is the vibrating element that produces sound in string instruments such as the guitar , harp , piano ( piano wire ) , and members of the violin family . Strings are lengths of a flexible material that a musical instrument holds under tension so that they can vibrate freely , but controllably . Strings may be plain , consisting only of a single material , like steel , nylon , or gut , or wound , having a core of one material and an overwinding of another . This is to make the string vibrate at the desired pitch , while maintaining a low profile and sufficient flexibility for playability . The invention of wound strings , such as nylon covered in wound metal , was a crucial step in string instrument technology , because a metal-wound string can produce a lower pitch than a catgut string of similar thickness . This enabled stringed instruments to be made with less thick bass strings . On string instruments that the player plucks or bows directly ( e.g. , double bass ) , this enabled instrument makers to use thinner strings for the lowest-pitched strings , which made the lower-pitch strings easier to play . On stringed instruments in which the player presses a keyboard , causing a mechanism to strike the strings , such as a piano , this enabled piano builders to use shorter , thicker strings to produce the lowest-pitched bass notes , enabling the building of smaller upright pianos designed for small rooms and practice rooms .",
  "/wiki/Geomungo": "The geomungo ( also spelled komungo or k\u014fmun'go ) or hyeongeum ( literally black zither , also spelled hyongum or hy\u014fn'g\u016dm ) is a traditional Korean stringed musical instrument of the zither family of instruments with both bridges and frets . Scholars believe that the name refers to Goguryeo and translates to Goguryeo zither or that it refers to the colour and translates to black crane zither ( hyeonhakgeum , \ud604\ud559\uae08 / \u7384\u9db4\u7434 ) . The geomungo 's place in Korean culture is traditionally that of a scholars instrument for self-cultivation , much like ancient Chinese had done with the guqin in China .",
  "/wiki/Guqin": "The guqin ( [ ku\u0300t\u0255\u02b0i\u030cn ] ( listen ) ; Chinese : \u53e4\u7434 ) is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family . It has been played since ancient times , and has traditionally been favoured by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement , as highlighted by the quote a gentleman does not part with his qin or se without good reason , as well as being associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius . It is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as the father of Chinese music or the instrument of the sages . The guqin is not to be confused with the guzheng , another Chinese long zither also without frets , but with moveable bridges under each string . Traditionally , the instrument was simply referred to as the qin ( \u7434 ) but by the twentieth century the term had come to be applied to many other musical instruments as well : the yangqin hammered dulcimer , the huqin family of bowed string instruments , and the Western piano are examples of this usage . The prefix gu- ( \u53e4 ; meaning ancient ) was later added for clarification . Thus , the instrument is called guqin today . It can also be called qixian-qin ( \u4e03\u7d43\u7434 ; lit . seven-stringed zither ) . Because Robert Hans van Gulik 's book about the qin is called The Lore of the Chinese Lute , the guqin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute . Other incorrect classifications , mainly from music compact discs , include harp or table-harp . The guqin is a very quiet instrument , with a range of about four octaves , and its open strings are tuned in the bass register .",
  "/wiki/Music_of_China": "Music of China refers to the music of the Chinese people , which may be the music of the Han Chinese as well as other ethnic minorities within mainland China . It also includes music produced by people of Chinese origin in some territories outside mainland China using traditional Chinese instruments or in the Chinese language . It covers a highly diverse range of music from the traditional to the modern . Different types of music have been recorded in historical Chinese documents from the early periods of Chinese civilization which , together with archaeological artifacts discovered , provided evidence of a well-developed musical culture as early as the Zhou dynasty ( 1122 BC - 256 BC ) . These further developed into various forms of music through succeeding dynasties , producing the rich heritage of music that is part of the Chinese cultural landscape today . Chinese music continues to evolve in the modern times , and more contemporary forms of music have also emerged .",
  "/wiki/Guzheng": "The zheng ( Chinese : \u7b8f ; pinyin : zh\u0113ng ; Wade-Giles : cheng ) or guzheng ( Chinese : \u53e4\u7b8f ; pinyin : g\u01d4zh\u0113ng ; literally : 'ancient zheng ' ) , also known as a Chinese zither , is a Chinese plucked string instrument with a more than 2,500-year history . The modern guzheng commonly has 21 , 25 or 26 strings , is 64 inches ( 1.6 m ) long , and is tuned in a major pentatonic scale . It has a large , resonant soundboard made from Paulownia . Other components are often made from other woods for structural or decorative reasons . Guzheng players often wear fingerpicks made from materials such as plastic , resin , tortoiseshell , or ivory on one or both hands . The guzheng is ancestral to several other Asian zithers such as the Japanese koto , the Korean gayageum , Mongolian yatga , the Vietnamese \u0111\u00e0n tranh , and the Sundanese kacapi . The guzheng should not be confused with the guqin , a Chinese zither with 7 strings played without moveable bridges . The guzheng has gone through many changes during its long history . The oldest specimen yet discovered held 13 strings and was dated to around 500 BCE , possibly during the Warring States period ( 475-221 BCE ) . The guzheng became prominent during the Qin dynasty ( 221-206 BCE ) . By the Tang Dynasty ( 618-907 CE ) the guzheng may have been the most commonly played instrument in China .",

The koto is the national instrument of Japan . Koto are about 180 centimetres ( 71 in ) length , and made from kiri wood ( Paulownia tomentosa ) . They have 13 strings that are usually strung over 13 movable bridges along the width of the instrument . There is also a 17-string variant . Players can adjust the string pitches by moving the white bridges before playing . To play the instrument , the strings are plucked using three finger picks ( thumb , index finger , and middle finger ) .",

It is a variant of the koto , which traditionally has thirteen strings . The instrument is also known as j\u016bshichi-gens\u014d ( \u5341\u4e03\u7d43\u7b8f ) , seventeen-stringed koto , or bass koto ( although kotos with a greater number of strings also exist ) . The j\u016bshichi-gen was invented in 1921 by Michio Miyagi , a musician who felt that the standard koto lacked the range he sought . His seventeen-stringed creation , sometimes described as a bass koto , has a deeper sound and requires specialized plectra ( picks worn attached to the player 's fingers with which the strings are plucked ) . Though his original j\u016bshichi-gen was considerably larger than a normal koto , seventeen-stringed koto of a normal koto size are more common today ; these presumably do not have as deep a sound .",
  "/wiki/Se_(instrument)": "The history of the se extends back to early Chinese history . It was one of the most important stringed instruments to be created in China , other than the guzheng . The se was a highly popular instrument during the Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn period . Together with the qin , it is mentioned in the well-known first poem of the Classic of Poetry , Guan ju , a work dating to the seventh century BCE . Surviving specimens have been excavated from places such as the Hubei and Hunan provinces , and the Jiangnan region of China . Other places include Jiangsu , Anhui , Shandong , and Liaoning . In Hubei , the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng ( in the late 400 's BCE ) was a treasure trove of ancient Chinese instruments , including a complete set of bianzhong ( bronze bells ) , se , guqin ( plucked zither ) , stone chimes , and a drum . His musical entourage of 21 girls and women were also buried with him . By the Warring States Period , the early types of guzheng emerged , which was developed from the se . Thus , it is sometimes said that the guzheng is essentially a smaller and simplified version of the se ( with less strings ) . According to legend , Fuxi created the se . And so it is believed that by the time of the Xia Dynasty the se had already come into being .",
