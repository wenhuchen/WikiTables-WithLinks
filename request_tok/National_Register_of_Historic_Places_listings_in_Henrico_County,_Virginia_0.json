Nearby , the Chickahominy River separates New Kent from Charles City County . U.S. Route 60 and State Route 155 pass through Providence Forge . The Colonial Downs horse-racing facility is located nearby adjacent to the Providence Forge exit of Interstate 64 . A station on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway ( C & O ) was located at Providence Forge in 1881 during construction of the railroad 's new Peninsula Subdivision , which was built primarily to facilitate transportation of West Virginia bituminous coal to the newly created city of Newport News . There , on the harbor of Hampton Roads , coal piers were built to load colliers for worldwide export shipment . The C & O 's Peninsula Extension was good news for the farmers and merchants of the Virginia Peninsula , and they generally welcomed the railroad . Providence Forge was a stop for passengers until about 1931 and for freight until at least the late 1960s , according to the Chesapeake & Ohio Historical Society . The structure was dismantled sometime in 2006 .

  "/wiki/James_River_and_Kanawha_Canal_Historic_District": "The James River and Kanawha Canal was a partially built canal in Virginia intended to facilitate shipments of passengers and freight by water between the western counties of Virginia and the coast . Ultimately its towpath became the roadbed for a rail line following the same course . Surveyed and planned by George Washington , [ citation needed ] the canal project was begun in 1785 as the James River Company , and later restarted under the James River and Kanawha Canal Company . It was an expensive project which failed several times financially and was frequently damaged by floods . Though largely financed by the Commonwealth of Virginia through the Virginia Board of Public Works , it was only half completed by 1851 , reaching Buchanan , in Botetourt County . When work to extend it further west stopped permanently , railroads were overtaking the canal as a far more productive mode of transportation . After the American Civil War funds for resuming construction were unavailable from either the war-torn Commonwealth or private sources and the project did poorly against railroad competition , finally succumbing to damage done by massive flooding in 1877 . In the end its right-of-way was bought and the canal was largely dismantled by the new Richmond and Allegheny Railroad , which laid tracks on the former towpath . The R & A became part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in the 1890s , which developed much of the former canal route into an important line for West Virginia bituminous coal headed eastbound for the Peninsula Extension to reach the Hampton Roads coal piers at Newport News for worldwide export aboard large colliers .",
