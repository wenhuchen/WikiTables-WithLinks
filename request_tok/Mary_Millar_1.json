Manhattan serves as the city 's economic and administrative center , cultural identifier , and historical birthplace . The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island , bounded by the Hudson , East , and Harlem rivers ; as well as several small adjacent islands . Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill , a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland , that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River . Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components , each aligned with the borough 's long axis : Lower , Midtown , and Upper Manhattan . Manhattan has been described as the cultural , financial , media , and entertainment capital of the world , and the borough hosts the United Nations Headquarters .

  "/wiki/The_Relapse": "The Relapse , or , Virtue in Danger is a Restoration comedy from 1696 written by John Vanbrugh . The play is a sequel to Colley Cibber 's Love 's Last Shift , or , The Fool in Fashion . In Cibber 's Love 's Last Shift , a free-living Restoration rake is brought to repentance and reform by the ruses of his wife , while in The Relapse , the rake succumbs again to temptation and has a new love affair . His virtuous wife is also subjected to a determined seduction attempt , and resists with difficulty . Vanbrugh planned The Relapse around particular actors at Drury Lane , writing their stage habits , public reputations , and personal relationships into the text . One such actor was Colley Cibber himself , who played the luxuriant fop Lord Foppington in both Love 's Last Shift and The Relapse . However , Vanbrugh 's artistic plans were threatened by a cutthroat struggle between London 's two theatre companies , each of which was seducing actors from the other . The Relapse came close to being not produced at all , but the successful performance that was eventually achieved in November 1696 vindicated Vanbrugh 's intentions , and saved the company from bankruptcy as well . Unlike Love 's Last Shift , which never again performed after the 1690s , The Relapse has retained its audience appeal . In the 18th century , however , its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted adultery gradually became unacceptable to public opinion , and the original play was for a century replaced on the stage by Sheridan 's moralised version A Trip to Scarborough ( 1777 ) . On the modern stage , The Relapse has been established as one of the most popular Restoration comedies , valued for Vanbrugh 's light , throwaway wit and the consummate acting part of Lord Foppington , a burlesque character with a dark side .",

The plot follows two theatre critics named Moon and Birdboot who are watching a ludicrous setup of a country house murder mystery , in the style of a whodunit . By chance , they become involved in the action causing a series of events that parallel the play they are watching . The play was written between 1961 and 1962 , drawing on Stoppard 's experiences as a Bristol theatre critic . It was initially named The Stand-ins and later , The Critics . It is a parody of the stereotypical parlor mystery in the style of Agatha Christie 's The Mousetrap , as well as of the critics watching the play , with their personal desires and obsessions interwoven into their bombastic and pompous reviews . The title is a direct reference to the ending of The Mousetrap , a play well known for guarding the secrecy of its twist ending , although the producers of Agatha Christie 's play could not publicly object without drawing even more attention to the fact . [ citation needed ] The Real Inspector Hound , much like Stoppard 's earlier play Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead , examines the ideas of fate and free will , as well as exploring the themes of the 'play within a play ' .

First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James 's Theatre in London , it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations . Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London , the play 's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage , and the resulting satire of Victorian ways . Some contemporary reviews praised the play 's humour and the culmination of Wilde 's artistic career , while others were cautious about its lack of social messages . Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde 's most enduringly popular play . The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde 's career but also heralded his downfall . The Marquess of Queensberry , whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde 's lover , planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show . Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission . Their feud came to a climax in court , where Wilde 's homosexuality was revealed to the Victorian public and he was sentenced to imprisonment . Despite the play 's early success , Wilde 's notoriety caused the play to be closed after 86 performances . After his release from prison , he published the play from exile in Paris , but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work .
