  "/wiki/SCImago_Journal_Rank": "SCImago Journal Rank ( SJR indicator ) is a measure of scientific influence of scholarly journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from . A journal 's SJR is a numeric value indicating the average number of weighted citations received during a selected year per document published in that journal during the previous three years . Higher SJR values are meant to indicate greater journal prestige . The SJR indicator is a variant of the eigenvector centrality measure used in network theory . Such measures establish the importance of a node in a network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node . The SJR indicator has been developed to be used in extremely large and heterogeneous journal citation networks . It is a size-independent indicator and its values order journals by their average prestige per article and can be used for journal comparisons in science evaluation processes . The SJR indicator is a free journal metric inspired by , and using an algorithm similar to , PageRank . The SJR indicator provides an alternative to the impact factor ( IF ) or average citations per document in a 2-year period , abbreviated as Cites per Doc . ( 2y ) .",
  "/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index_(INSEAD)": "The Global Innovation Index ( GII ) is an annual ranking of countries by their capacity for , and success in , innovation .

The GII is commonly used by corporate and government officials to compare countries by their level of innovation . The GII is computed by taking a simple average of the scores in two sub-indices , the Innovation Input Index and Innovation Output Index , which are composed of five and two pillars respectively . Each of these pillars describe an attribute of innovation , and comprise up to five indicators , and their score is calculated by the weighted average method .",

  "/wiki/Innovation": "Innovation in its modern meaning is a new idea , creative thoughts , new imaginations in form of device or method . Innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements , unarticulated needs , or existing market needs . Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective products , processes , services , technologies , or business models that are made available to markets , governments and society . An innovation is something original and more effective and , as a consequence , new , that breaks into the market or society . Innovation is related to , but not the same as , invention , as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention ( ie new / improved ability ) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society , and not all innovations require an invention . Innovation often [ quantify ] manifests itself via the engineering process , when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature . The opposite of innovation is exnovation . While a novel device is often described [ by whom ? ] as an innovation , in economics , management science , and other fields of practice and analysis , innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society . In industrial economics , innovations are created and found [ by whom ? ] empirically from services to meet growing consumer demand . Innovation also has an older historical meaning which is quite different .",

  "/wiki/Academic_publishing": "Academic publishing is the subfield of publishing which distributes academic research and scholarship . Most academic work is published in academic journal article , book or thesis form . The part of academic written output that is not formally published but merely printed up or posted on the Internet is often called grey literature . Most scientific and scholarly journals , and many academic and scholarly books , though not all , are based on some form of peer review or editorial refereeing to qualify texts for publication . Peer review quality and selectivity standards vary greatly from journal to journal , publisher to publisher , and field to field . Most established academic disciplines have their own journals and other outlets for publication , although many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary , and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields . There is also a tendency for existing journals to divide into specialized sections as the field itself becomes more specialized . Along with the variation in review and publication procedures , the kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions to knowledge or research differ greatly among fields and subfields . Academic publishing is undergoing major changes , as it makes the transition from the print to the electronic format . Business models are different in the electronic environment . Since the early 1990s , licensing of electronic resources , particularly journals , has been very common . An important trend , particularly with respect to journals in the sciences , is open access via the Internet .",
  "/wiki/Science": "Science ( from the Latin word scientia , meaning knowledge ) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe . The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE . Their contributions to mathematics , astronomy , and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity , whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries ( 400 to 1000 CE ) of the Middle Ages but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age . The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy , which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions . The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape ; along with the changing of natural philosophy to natural science . Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences ( e.g. , biology , chemistry , and physics ) , which study nature in the broadest sense ; the social sciences ( e.g. , economics , psychology , and sociology ) , which study individuals and societies ; and the formal sciences ( e.g. , logic , mathematics , and theoretical computer science ) , which study abstract concepts . There is disagreement , however , on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence . Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes , such as engineering and medicine , are described as applied sciences . Science is based on research , which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies . The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products , armaments , health care , and environmental protection .",
  "/wiki/Technology": "Technology ( science of craft , from Greek \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 , techne , art , skill , cunning of hand ; and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 , -logia ) is the sum of techniques , skills , methods , and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives , such as scientific investigation . Technology can be the knowledge of techniques , processes , and the like , or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings . Systems ( e. g. machines ) applying technology by taking an input , changing it according to the system 's use , and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems . The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools . The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food , and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment . Developments in historic times , including the printing press , the telephone , and the Internet , have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale . Technology has many effects . It has helped develop more advanced economies ( including today 's global economy ) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class . Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth 's environment . Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology . Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity , and the challenges of bioethics . Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology , with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it .",
  "/wiki/Mathematics": "Mathematics ( from Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 m\u00e1th\u0113ma , knowledge , study , learning ) includes the study of such topics as quantity ( number theory ) , structure ( algebra ) , space ( geometry ) , and change ( mathematical analysis ) . It has no generally accepted definition . Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures ; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof . When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena , mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature . Through the use of abstraction and logic , mathematics developed from counting , calculation , measurement , and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects . Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist . The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry . Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics , most notably in Euclid 's Elements . Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano ( 1858-1932 ) , David Hilbert ( 1862-1943 ) , and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century , it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions . Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance , when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day . Mathematics is essential in many fields , including natural science , engineering , medicine , finance , and the social sciences . Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines , such as statistics and game theory .",

Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines , and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves . [ a ] Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and , through its inclusion of astronomy , perhaps the oldest . Over much of the past two millennia , physics , chemistry , biology , and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy , but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right . [ b ] Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research , such as biophysics and quantum chemistry , and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined . New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy . Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies . For example , advances in the understanding of electromagnetism , solid-state physics , and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society , such as television , computers , domestic appliances , and nuclear weapons ; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization ; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus .",

  "/wiki/Medicine": "Medicine is the science and practice of establishing the diagnosis , prognosis , treatment , and prevention of disease . Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness . Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research , genetics , and medical technology to diagnose , treat , and prevent injury and disease , typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery , but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy , external splints and traction , medical devices , biologics , and ionizing radiation , amongst others . Medicine has been around for thousands of years , during most of which it was an art ( an area of skill and knowledge ) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture . For example , a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing , or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism . In recent centuries , since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science ( both basic and applied , under the umbrella of medical science ) . While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice , the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science . Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine , though they do not fall within the modern definition of medicine which is based in medical science . Traditional medicine and folk medicine remain commonly used with , or instead of , scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine",
  "/wiki/Chemistry": "Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms , molecules and ions : their composition , structure , properties , behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances . In the scope of its subject , chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology . It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level . For example , chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry ( botany ) , the formation of igneous rocks ( geology ) , how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded ( ecology ) , the properties of the soil on the moon ( astrophysics ) , how medications work ( pharmacology ) , and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene ( forensics ) . Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds . There are four types of chemical bonds : covalent bonds , in which compounds share one or more electron ( s ) ; ionic bonds , in which a compound donates one or more electrons to another compound to produce ions ( cations and anions ) ; hydrogen bonds ; and Van der Waals force bonds .",
  "/wiki/Nanotechnology": "Nanotechnology ( nanotech ) is manipulation of matter on an atomic , molecular , and supramolecular scale . The earliest , widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products , also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology . A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative , which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers . This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale , and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold . It is therefore common to see the plural form nanotechnologies as well as nanoscale technologies to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size . Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad , including fields of science as diverse as surface science , organic chemistry , molecular biology , semiconductor physics , energy storage , microfabrication , molecular engineering , etc . The associated research and applications are equally diverse , ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly , from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale . Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology . Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications , such as in nanomedicine , nanoelectronics , biomaterials energy production , and consumer products . On the other hand , nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology , including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials , and their potential effects on global economics , as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios . These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted .",

The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council .

  "/wiki/Technology_Life_Cycle": "The technology life-cycle ( TLC ) describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase , and the financial return during its vital life . Some technologies , such as steel , paper or cement manufacturing , have a long lifespan ( with minor variations in technology incorporated with time ) while in other cases , such as electronic or pharmaceutical products , the lifespan may be quite short . The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle ( PLC ) dealt with in product life-cycle management . The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction , marketing measures , and business costs . The technology underlying the product ( for example , that of a uniquely flavoured tea ) may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different . The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology , the timeline of recovering cost , and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved . The TLC may , further , be protected during its cycle with patents and trademarks seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it . The product of the technology may be a commodity such as polyethylene plastic or a sophisticated product like the integrated circuits used in a smartphone . The development of a competitive product or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology , making it shorter . Equally , the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements ( if any ) through leakages also work to reduce a technology 's lifespan . Thus , it is apparent that the management of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development .

Emerging technologies are often perceived as capable of changing the status quo . Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty ( in application even if not in origins ) , relatively fast growth , coherence , prominent impact , and uncertainty and ambiguity . In other words , an emerging technology can be defined as a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain ( s ) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors , institutions and patterns of interactions among those , along with the associated knowledge production processes .

  "/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations": "Diffusion of innovations is a theory that seeks to explain how , why , and at what rate new ideas and technology spread . Everett Rogers , a professor of communication studies , popularized the theory in his book Diffusion of Innovations ; the book was first published in 1962 , and is now in its fifth edition ( 2003 ) . Rogers argues that diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated over time among the participants in a social system . The origins of the diffusion of innovations theory are varied and span multiple disciplines . Rogers proposes that four main elements influence the spread of a new idea : the innovation itself , communication channels , time , and a social system . This process relies heavily on human capital . The innovation must be widely adopted in order to self-sustain . Within the rate of adoption , there is a point at which an innovation reaches critical mass . The categories of adopters are innovators , early adopters , early majority , late majority , and laggards . Diffusion manifests itself in different ways and is highly subject to the type of adopters and innovation-decision process . The criterion for the adopter categorization is innovativeness , defined as the degree to which an individual adopts a new idea .",
  "/wiki/Human_capital": "Human capital is the stock of habits , knowledge , social and personality attributes ( including creativity ) embodied in the ability to perform labour so as to produce economic value . Human capital is unique and differs from any other capital . It is needed for companies to achieve goals , develop and remain innovative . Companies can invest in human capital for example through education and training enabling improved levels of quality and production . Human capital theory is closely associated with the study of human resources management as found in the practice of business administration and macroeconomics . The original idea of human capital can be traced back at least to Adam Smith in the 18th century . The modern theory was popularized by Gary Becker , an economist and Nobel Laureate from the University of Chicago , Jacob Mincer , and Theodore Schultz . As a result of his conceptualization and modeling work using Human Capital as a key factor , the 2018 Nobel Prize for Economics was jointly awarded to Paul Romer , who founded the modern innovation-driven approach to understanding economic growth . In the recent literature , the new concept of task-specific human capital was coined in 2004 by Robert Gibbon , an economist at MIT , and Michael Waldman , an economist at Cornell University . The concept emphasizes that in many cases , human capital is accumulated specific to the nature of the task ( or , skills required for the task ) , and the human capital accumulated for the task are valuable to many firms requiring the transferable skills . This concept can be applied to job-assignment , wage dynamics , tournament , promotion dynamics inside firms , etc .",

The term is believed to have originated from Thorstein Veblen ( 1857-1929 ) , an American sociologist and economist . The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely Clarence Ayres who was a follower of Thorstein Veblen and John Dewey . William Ogburn was also known for his radical technological determinism . The first major elaboration of a technological determinist view of socioeconomic development came from the German philosopher and economist Karl Marx , who argued that changes in technology , and specifically productive technology , are the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structure , and that social relations and cultural practices ultimately revolve around the technological and economic base of a given society . Marx 's position has become embedded in contemporary society , where the idea that fast-changing technologies alter human lives is pervasive . Although many authors attribute a technologically determined view of human history to Marx 's insights , not all Marxists are technological determinists , and some authors question the extent to which Marx himself was a determinist . Furthermore , there are multiple forms of technological determinism .",
  "/wiki/Patent": "A patent is a form of intellectual property that gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making , using , selling and importing an invention for a limited period of years , in exchange for publishing an enabling public disclosure of the invention . In most countries patent rights fall under civil law and the patent holder needs to sue someone infringing the patent in order to enforce his or her rights . In some industries patents are an essential form of competitive advantage ; in others they are irrelevant . :17 The procedure for granting patents , requirements placed on the patentee , and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements . Typically , however , a patent application must include one or more claims that define the invention . A patent may include many claims , each of which defines a specific property right . These claims must meet relevant patentability requirements , such as novelty , usefulness , and non-obviousness . Under the World Trade Organization 's ( WTO ) TRIPS Agreement , patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention , in all fields of technology , provided they are new , involve an inventive step , and are capable of industrial application . Nevertheless , there are variations on what is patentable subject matter from country to country , also among WTO member states . TRIPS also provides that the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years .",
  "/wiki/Business_incubator": "A business incubator is a company that helps new and startup companies to develop by providing services such as management training or office space . The National Business Incubation Association ( NBIA ) defines business incubators as a catalyst tool for either regional or national economic development . NBIA categorizes their members incubators by the following five incubator types : academic institutions ; non-profit development corporations ; for-profit property development ventures ; venture capital firms , and combination of the above . Business incubators differ from research and technology parks in their dedication to startup and early-stage companies . Research and technology parks , on the other hand , tend to be large-scale projects that house everything from corporate , government or university labs to very small companies . Most research and technology parks do not offer business assistance services , which are the hallmark of a business incubation program . However , many research and technology parks house incubation programs . Incubators also differ from the U.S. Small Business Administration 's Small Business Development Centers ( and similar business support programs ) in that they serve only selected clients . Congress created the Small Business Administration in the Small Business Act of July 30 , 1953 . Its purpose is to aid , counsel , assist and protect , insofar as is possible , the interests of small business concerns . In addition , the charter ensures that small businesses receive a fair proportion of any government contracts and sales of surplus property . SBDCs work with any small business at any stage of development , not only startup companies .",
  "/wiki/Invention": "An invention is a unique or novel device , method , composition or process . The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process . It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result . An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough . Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field . An inventor may be taking a big step toward success or failure . Some inventions can be patented . A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention . The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive . Another meaning of invention is cultural invention , which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others . The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books . Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity .",
  "/wiki/Seed_accelerator": "Startup accelerators , also known as seed accelerators , are fixed-term , cohort-based programs that include seed investment , connections , sales , mentorship , educational components , and culminate in a public pitch event or demo day to accelerate growth . Most startup accelerators in Silicon Valley and globally are privately funded as an investment fund that take equity and focus on a wide range of industries .",
  "/wiki/Science_park": "A science park ( also called a university research park , technology park , technopole , or a science and technology park ( STP ) ) is defined as being a property-based development that accommodates and fosters the growth of tenant firms and that is affiliated with a university ( or a government and private research bodies ) based on proximity , ownership , and/or governance . This is so that knowledge can be shared , innovation promoted , and research outcomes progressed to viable commercial products . Science parks are also often perceived as contributing to national economic development , stimulating the formation of new high-technology firms , attracting foreign investment and promoting exports .",
  "/wiki/Trademark": "A trademark ( also written trade mark or trade-mark ) is a type of intellectual property consisting of a recognizable sign , design , or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others , although trademarks used to identify services are usually called service marks . The trademark owner can be an individual , business organization , or any legal entity . A trademark may be located on a package , a label , a voucher , or on the product itself . For the sake of corporate identity , trademarks are often displayed on company buildings . It is legally recognized as a type of intellectual property . The first legislative act concerning trademarks was passed in 1266 under the reign of Henry III , requiring all bakers to use a distinctive mark for the bread they sold . [ citation needed ] The first modern trademark laws emerged in the late 19th century . In France the first comprehensive trademark system in the world was passed into law in 1857 . The Trade Marks Act 1938 of the United Kingdom changed the system , permitting registration based on intent-to-use , creating an examination based process , and creating an application publication system . The 1938 Act , which served as a model for similar legislation elsewhere , contained other novel concepts such as associated trademarks , a consent to use system , a defensive mark system , and non claiming right system . The symbols \u2122 ( the trademark symbol ) and \u00ae ( the registered trademark symbol ) can be used to indicate trademarks ; the latter is only for use by the owner of a trademark that has been registered .",
  "/wiki/List_of_space_agencies": "This is a list of government agencies engaged in activities related to outer space and space exploration . As of 2018 , 72 different government space agencies are in existence ; 14 of those have launch capability .

  "/wiki/Timeline_of_first_orbital_launches_by_country": "This is a timeline of first orbital launches by country . While a number of countries have built satellites , as of 2019 , eleven countries have had the capability to send objects into orbit using their own launch vehicles . Russia and Ukraine inherited the space launchers and satellites capability from the Soviet Union , following its dissolution in 1991 . Russia launches its rockets from its own and foreign ( Kazakh ) spaceports . Ukraine launched only from foreign ( Russian and Kazakh ) launch facilities until 2015 , after which political differences with Russia effectively halted Ukraine 's ability to produce orbital rockets . France became a space power independently , launching a payload into orbit from Algeria , before joining space launcher facilities in the multi-national Ariane project . The United Kingdom became a space power independently following a single payload insertion into orbit from Australia , before discontinuing official participation in space launch capability , including the Ariane project , in the 1970s . Thus , as of 2019 [ update ] , nine countries and one inter-governmental organisation ( ESA ) currently have a proven orbital launch capability , [ a ] and three countries ( France , Italy and UK ) formerly had such an independent capability . In all cases where a country has conducted independent human spaceflights ( as of 2019 , three - Russia , USA , and China ) , these launches were preceded by independent unmanned launch capability . The race to launch the first satellite was closely contested by the Soviet Union and the United States , and was the beginning of the Space Race . The launching of satellites , while still contributing to national prestige , is a significant economic activity as well , with public and private rocket systems competing for launches , using cost and reliability as selling points .",
  "/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty": "The Outer Space Treaty , formally the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies , is a treaty that forms the basis of international space law . The treaty was opened for signature in the United States , the United Kingdom , and the Soviet Union on 27 January 1967 , and entered into force on 10 October 1967 . As of June 2019 , 109 countries are parties to the treaty , while another 23 have signed the treaty but have not completed ratification . In addition , Taiwan , which is currently recognized by 14 UN member states , ratified the treaty prior to the United Nations General Assembly 's vote to transfer China 's seat to the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) in 1971 . Among the Outer Space Treaty 's main points are that it prohibits the placing of nuclear weapons in space , it limits the use of the Moon and all other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes only , and establishes that space shall be free for exploration and use by all nations , but that no nation may claim sovereignty of outer space or any celestial body . The Outer Space Treaty does not ban military activities within space , military space forces , or the weaponization of space , with the exception of the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space . It is mostly a non-armament treaty and offers insufficient and ambiguous regulations to newer space activities such as lunar and asteroid mining .",
  "/wiki/Animals_in_space": "Non-human animals in space originally served to test the survivability of spaceflight , before human spaceflights were attempted . Later , other non-human animals were flown to investigate various biological processes and the effects microgravity and space flight might have on them . Bioastronautics is an area of bioengineering research which spans the study and support of life in space . To date , seven national space programs have flown animals into space : the Soviet Union , the United States , France , Argentina , China , Japan and Iran . A wide variety of non-human animals have been launched into space , including monkeys , dogs , tortoises , mice , and insects . The United States launched flights containing monkeys and primates primarily between 1948-1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985 . France launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967 . The Soviet Union and Russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996 . During the 1950s and 1960s , the Soviet space program used a number of dogs for sub-orbital and orbital space flights . Two tortoises and a variety of insects were the first inhabitants of Earth to circle the Moon , on the 1968 Zond 5 mission . Fe , Fi , Fo , Fum , and Phooey were five mice who circled the Moon 75 times in the orbiter of the 1972 Apollo 17 mission , the last crewed voyage to the Moon .",
