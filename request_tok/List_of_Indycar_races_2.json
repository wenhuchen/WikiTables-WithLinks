Better known as the Indy 500 or the Indianapolis 500 , it is held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway ( IMS ) in Speedway , Indiana , United States , an enclave suburb of Indianapolis , Indiana . The event is held over Memorial Day weekend in late May . It is contested as part of the IndyCar Series , the top level of American Championship Car racing , an open-wheel open-cockpit formula colloquially known as Indy Car Racing . The name of the race is often shortened to Indy 500 , and the track itself is nicknamed the Brickyard , as the racing surfacing was paved in brick in the fall of 1909 , with a yard of brick remaining exposed at the start/finish line . The event billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing , is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport , which comprises three of the most prestigious motorsports events in the world , also including the Monaco Grand Prix and the 24 Hours of Le Mans . The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management , but the permanent seating capacity is upwards of 250,000 , and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000 . It shares its date with NASCAR 's 600-mile event at Charlotte , with drivers having completed both events in one day before in a so-called Double Duty . The inaugural race was held in 1911 and was won by Ray Harroun . The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011 , and the 100th running was held in 2016 . The event was put on hiatus twice , from 1917 to 1918 due to World War I and from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II . Simon Pagenaud is the current champion .",

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

In total , the Indianapolis 500 was not held from 1942 to 1945 . This was the second instance in which the Indianapolis Motor Speedway suspended the annual running of the Indianapolis 500 . During World War I the Speedway management voluntarily suspended competition in 1917-1918 . However , for World War II , the decision to cancel the race was more resolute , and ultimately was part of a four-year nationwide ban on automobile racing . During the war , the track was closed and neglected , and fell into a terrible state of disrepair . Towards the end of the war , revival of the 500 appeared unlikely , and the facility was in danger of being demolished in favor of development .",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",

CART was founded in 1979 by United States Auto Club ( USAC ) Championship Division team owners who disagreed with the direction and leadership of USAC , with the then-novel idea of car owners sanctioning and promoting their own series collectively instead of relying on a neutral body to do so . Through the 1980s , the Indy Car World Series became the pre-eminent open-wheel auto racing series in North America , featuring street circuits , road courses , and oval track racing . CART drivers continued to compete at the USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 . Even as the series prospered , concerns about costs , competitiveness , and revenue sharing began to create opposition to CART 's organizational structure . Attempts at reform , which saw the company rebranded as IndyCar in 1992 and a compromise board formed , failed . In 1996 , an open wheel split saw the newly created Indy Racing League ( IRL ) take full control over the Indianapolis 500 and start a competing oval-based open-wheel series . CART ceased using the IndyCar name but continued its series without participating in the Indianapolis 500 . The split saw a dramatic fall in general interest for open wheel racing in the United States , which was compounded by the growing popularity of NASCAR , creating a downward trend in sponsorship and attendance at some tracks . After a series of setbacks in the early 2000s saw the departure of major racing teams and engine manufacturers to the IRL , CART went bankrupt at the end of the 2003 season .
