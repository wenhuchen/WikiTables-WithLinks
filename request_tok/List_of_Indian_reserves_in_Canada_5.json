Though known by several names in the past , such as Algoumequin ( at the time of Samuel de Champlain ) , the most common term Algonquin has been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word elak\u00f3mkwik ( IPA : [ \u025bl\u00e6\u02c8\u0261omo\u0261wik ] ) : they are our relatives/allies . The much larger heterogeneous group of Algonquian-speaking peoples , who , according to Brian Conwell , stretch from Virginia to the Rocky Mountains and north to Hudson Bay , was named after the tribe . Most Algonquins live in Quebec . The nine Algonquin bands in that province and one in Ontario have a combined population of about 11,000 . The Algonquin are original natives of southern Quebec and eastern Ontario in Canada . Today they live in nine communities in Quebec and one in Ontario . The Algonquin were a small tribe that also lives in northern Michigan and southern Quebec and eastern Ontario . ( Popular usage reflects some confusion on the point .
