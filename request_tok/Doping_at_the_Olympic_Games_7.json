  "/wiki/Anabolic_steroid": "Anabolic steroids , also known more properly as anabolic-androgenic steroids ( AAS ) , are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone . They are anabolic and increase protein within cells , especially in skeletal muscles , and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects , including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair . The word anabolic , referring to anabolism , comes from the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae anabole , that which is thrown up , mound . Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists , the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone . AAS were synthesized in the 1930s , and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite , induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions , such as cancer and AIDS . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS , in the presence of adequate diet , can contribute to increases in body weight , often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals . Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS . These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels ( increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein ) , acne , high blood pressure , liver damage ( mainly with most oral AAS ) , and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart . These risks are further increased when , as they often do , athletes take steroids alongside other drugs , causing significantly more damage to their bodies . The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes . Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS . In women and children , AAS can cause irreversible masculinization .",

  "/wiki/Testosterone": "Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid . In male humans , testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate , as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass , and the growth of body hair . In addition , testosterone is involved in health and well-being , and the prevention of osteoporosis . Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss . Testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively . It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites . It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor . In humans and most other vertebrates , testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and , to a lesser extent , the ovaries of females . On average , in adult males , levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females . As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced , the daily production is about 20 times greater in men . Females are also more sensitive to the hormone .
