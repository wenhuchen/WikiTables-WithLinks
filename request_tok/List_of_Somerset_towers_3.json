  "/wiki/Listed_building": "A listed building , or listed structure , is one that has been placed on one of the four statutory lists maintained by Historic England in England , Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland , Cadw in Wales , and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency in Northern Ireland . The term has also been used in Ireland , where buildings are surveyed for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage in accordance with the country 's obligations under the Granada Convention . However , the preferred term in Ireland is protected structure . A listed building may not be demolished , extended , or altered without special permission from the local planning authority , which typically consults the relevant central government agency , particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings . In England and Wales , a national amenity society must be notified of any work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition . Exemption from secular listed building control is provided for some buildings in current use for worship , but only in cases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent permissions procedure . Owners of listed buildings are , in some circumstances , compelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they fail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations . When alterations are permitted , or when listed buildings are repaired or maintained , the owners are often required to use specific materials or techniques . Although most sites appearing on the lists are buildings , other structures such as bridges , monuments , sculptures , war memorials , and even milestones and mileposts and The Beatles ' Abbey Road pedestrian crossing are also listed . Ancient , military , and uninhabited structures , such as Stonehenge , are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and protected by much older legislation , whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently listed on a non-statutory basis .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/Norman_architecture": "The term Norman architecture is used to categorise styles of Romanesque architecture developed by the Normans in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries . In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture . The Normans introduced large numbers of castles and fortifications including Norman keeps , and at the same time monasteries , abbeys , churches and cathedrals , in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded arches ( particularly over windows and doorways ) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style .",

  "/wiki/Rood_screen": "The rood screen ( also choir screen , chancel screen , or jub\u00e9 ) is a common feature in late medieval church architecture . It is typically an ornate partition between the chancel and nave , of more or less open tracery constructed of wood , stone , or wrought iron . The rood screen would originally have been surmounted by a rood loft carrying the Great Rood , a sculptural representation of the Crucifixion . In English , Scottish , and Welsh cathedrals , monastic , and collegiate churches , there were commonly two transverse screens , with a rood screen or rood beam located one bay west of the pulpitum screen , but this double arrangement nowhere survives complete , and accordingly the preserved pulpitum in such churches is sometimes referred to as a rood screen . At Wells Cathedral the medieval arrangement was restored in the 20th century , with the medieval strainer arch supporting a rood , placed in front of the pulpitum and organ . Rood screens can be found in churches in many parts of Europe , however , in Catholic countries they were generally removed during the Counter-reformation , when the retention of any visual barrier between the laity and the high altar was widely seen as inconsistent with the decrees of the Council of Trent . Accordingly , rood screens now survive in much greater numbers in Anglican and Lutheran churches ; with the greatest number of survivals complete with screen and rood figures in Scandinavia . The iconostasis in Eastern Christian churches is a visually similar barrier , but is now generally considered to have a different origin , deriving from the ancient altar screen or templon .

  "/wiki/Church_bell": "A church bell in the Christian tradition is a bell which is rung in a church for a variety of ceremonial purposes , and can be heard outside the building . Traditionally they are used to call worshippers to the church for a communal service , and to announce times of daily prayer , called the canonical hours . They are also rung on special occasions such as a wedding , or a funeral service . In some religious traditions they are used within the liturgy of the church service to signify to people that a particular part of the service has been reached . The ringing of church bells , in the Christian tradition , is also believed to drive out demons . The traditional European church bell ( see cutaway drawing ) used in Christian churches worldwide consists of a cup-shaped metal resonator with a pivoted clapper hanging inside which strikes the sides when the bell is swung . It is hung within a steeple or belltower of a church or religious building , so the sound can reach a wide area . Such bells are either fixed in position ( hung dead ) or hung from a pivoted beam ( the headstock ) so they can swing to and fro . A rope hangs from a lever or wheel attached to the headstock , and when the bell ringer pulls on the rope the bell swings back and forth and the clapper hits the inside , sounding the bell . Bells that are hung dead are normally sounded by hitting the sound bow with a hammer or occasionally by a rope which pulls the internal clapper against the bell . A church may have a single bell , or a collection of bells which are tuned to a common scale . They may be stationary and chimed , rung randomly by swinging through a small arc , or swung through a full circle to enable the high degree of control of English change ringing .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Victoria": "Victoria ( Alexandrina Victoria ; 24 May 1819 - 22 January 1901 ) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death . On 1 May 1876 , she adopted the additional title of Empress of India . Known as the Victorian era , her reign of 63 years and seven months was longer than that of any of her predecessors . It was a period of industrial , cultural , political , scientific , and military change within the United Kingdom , and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire . Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn ( the fourth son of King George III ) , and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld . After both the Duke and his father died in 1820 , she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller , John Conroy . She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father 's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue . The United Kingdom was an established constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power . Privately , she attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments ; publicly , she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality . Victoria married her cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840 . Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent , earning Victoria the sobriquet the grandmother of Europe and spreading haemophilia in European royalty . After Albert 's death in 1861 , Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances .",
  "/wiki/Octave": "In music , an octave ( Latin : octavus : eighth ) or perfect octave ( sometimes called the diapason ) is the interval between one musical pitch and another with double its frequency . The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the basic miracle of music , the use of which is common in most musical systems . The interval between the first and second harmonics of the harmonic series is an octave . In music notation , notes separated by an octave ( or multiple octaves ) have the same letter name and are of the same pitch class . To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals ( including unison , perfect fourth , and perfect fifth ) , the octave is designated P8 . Other interval qualities are also possible , though rare . The octave above or below an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8a or 8va ( Italian : all'ottava ) , 8va bassa ( Italian : all'ottava bassa , sometimes also 8vb ) , or simply 8 for the octave in the direction indicated by placing this mark above or below the staff .",
  "/wiki/Clock": "A clock is a device used to measure , keep , and indicate time . The clock is one of the oldest human inventions , meeting the need to measure intervals of time shorter than the natural units : the day , the lunar month , and the year . Devices operating on several physical processes have been used over the millennia . Some predecessors to the modern clock may be considered as clocks that are based on movement in nature : A sundial shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a flat surface . There is a range of duration timers , a well-known example being the hourglass . Water clocks , along with the sundials , are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments . A major advance occurred with the invention of the verge escapement , which made possible the first mechanical clocks around 1300 in Europe , which kept time with oscillating timekeepers like balance wheels . Traditionally in horology , the term clock was used for a striking clock , while a clock that did not strike the hours audibly was called a timepiece . In general usage today , a clock refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time . Watches and other timepieces that can be carried on one 's person are often distinguished from clocks . Spring-driven clocks appeared during the 15th century . During the 15th and 16th centuries , clockmaking flourished .",
  "/wiki/Hymn": "A hymn is a type of song , usually religious , specifically written for the purpose of adoration or prayer , and typically addressed to a deity or deities , or to a prominent figure or personification . The word hymn derives from Greek \u1f55\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( hymnos ) , which means a song of praise . A writer of hymns is known as a hymnist . The singing or composition of hymns is called hymnody . Collections of hymns are known as hymnals or hymn books . Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment . Although most familiar to speakers of English in the context of Christianity , hymns are also a fixture of other world religions , especially on the Indian subcontinent . Hymns also survive from antiquity , especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures . Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts .",
  "/wiki/Hymn_tune": "A hymn tune is the melody of a musical composition to which a hymn text is sung . Musically speaking , a hymn is generally understood to have four-part ( or more ) harmony , a fast harmonic rhythm ( chords change frequently ) , and no refrain or chorus . From the late sixteenth century in England and Scotland , when most people were not musically literate and learned melodies by rote , it was a common practice to sing a new text to a hymn tune the singers already knew which had a suitable meter and character . There are many hymn tunes which might fit a particular hymn : a hymn in Long Metre might be sung to any hymn tune in Long Metre , but the tunes might be as different as those tunes that have been used for centuries with hymns such as Te lucis ante terminum , on one hand , and an arrangement of the calypso tune used with Jamaica Farewell , on the other .",
