Rool ( Japanese : \u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb Hepburn : Kingu Kur\u016bru ) is a fictional anthropomorphic crocodile and the main antagonist of Nintendo 's Donkey Kong video game franchise , as well as the archenemy of Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong . K. Rool is the hot-tempered leader of a group of crocodilian raiders known as the Kremlings , who have crossed paths with the Kongs on many occasions . First appearing in the 1994 video game Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , he has been described as being to Donkey Kong what Bowser is to Mario . He is depicted as a crazed Kremling who frequently feigns defeat in order to deceive the Kongs ; he tricks them by wearing different costumes , and utilizes a variety of gadgets to his advantage . K. Rool resembles an overweight crocodile with an infected , bulging eye . The name K. Rool is a play on the word cruel , a nod to his malevolent nature . In addition to video games , K. Rool has appeared in the manga adaption of Donkey Kong Country , the Donkey Kong Country animated series , comics , and several pieces of Nintendo merchandise . In Donkey Kong 64 and the Game Boy Advance ports of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy , K. Rool 's voice was provided by former Rare developer Chris Sutherland . K. Rool is currently voiced by Japanese voice actor Toshihide Tsuchiya , who also provides the voice of Funky Kong .",
  "/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Country": "Donkey Kong Country [ \u03b1 ] is a 1994 platform game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , as part of the Donkey Kong franchise created by Shigeru Miyamoto . The game centers on the duo of Donkey Kong and his nephew Diddy Kong , who are on a quest to recover their stolen banana hoard from King K. Rool and his henchmen Kremlings . Development began shortly after Rare founders , brothers Tim and Chris Stamper , ran experiments with a Silicon Graphics ( SGI ) workstation to render 3D sprites . Nintendo became interested in Rare 's work and acquired 49% of the company , leading to the production of a game for the SNES using Alias and SGI technology . The Stamper brothers expressed interest in creating a standalone Donkey Kong game and assembled a team of 12 developers to work on the game over 18 months . Donkey Kong Country is the first Donkey Kong game that was not produced or directed by the franchise 's creator Shigeru Miyamoto , though he was involved with the project . Following an aggressive marketing campaign , Donkey Kong Country received critical acclaim and sold more than nine million copies worldwide , making it the third best-selling SNES game and has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time . It was ported to the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance consoles , and was made available for Nintendo 's Virtual Console . Donkey Kong Country is the first game in the Donkey Kong Country series and was followed by two sequels on the SNES : Donkey Kong Country 2 : Diddy 's Kong Quest in 1995 , and Donkey Kong Country 3 : Dixie Kong 's Double Trouble ! in 1996 . In 2017 , the game was released as a part of the Super NES Classic Edition .",

As a fifth generation console , the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn . The PlayStation was the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units , which it had reached nine years after its initial launch . In July 2000 , a redesigned , slim version called the PS one was released , replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor , the PlayStation 2 . The PlayStation 2 , which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation 's DualShock controller and games , was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000 . The last PS one units were sold in late 2006 to early 2007 shortly after it was officially discontinued , for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch eleven years earlier . Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 - over eleven years after it had been released , and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3 .

  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems .

The Dreamcast was Sega 's final home console , marking the end of the company 's 18 years in the console market . In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn , the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components , including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU . Released in Japan to a subdued reception , the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign , but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2 . Sales did not meet Sega 's expectations despite several price cuts , and the company continued to incur significant financial losses . After a change in leadership , Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31 , 2001 , withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher . 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide . Although the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited third-party support , reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time .

The sequel , Sonic 2 , gave Sonic a fox friend named Tails . Shortly afterward , Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose , a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic , and Sonic 3 introduced Knuckles the Echidna , Sonic 's rival and , later , friend . All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games . The series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years . These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like Shadow the Hedgehog and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like Metal Sonic and E-123 Omega , as well as human characters like Eggman 's grandfather Gerald Robotnik . The series also features two fictional species : Chao , which have usually functioned as digital pets and minor gameplay and plot elements , and more recently , Wisps , which have been used as power-ups .

A spin-off from the Sonic the Hedgehog series , it features Knuckles the Echidna and four other characters known as the Chaotix , who must prevent Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic from obtaining six magic rings and conquering a mysterious island . Gameplay is similar to previous Sonic games : players complete levels while collecting rings and defeating enemies . Knuckles ' Chaotix introduces a partner system whereby the player is connected to another character via a tether ; the tether behaves like a rubber band and must be used to maneuver the characters . While Sonic Team is sometimes credited with creating Knuckles ' Chaotix , it was developed by another Sega team . Production began with Sonic Crackers , a 1994 prototype for the Sega Genesis which experimented with the tethering system and featured Sonic and Tails . The game was intended for release as a mainline Sonic entry for the Sega Saturn , but transitioned to the 32X when it could not be completed in time . Sonic and Tails were replaced by Knuckles and a group of mostly pre-existing characters ; Mighty the Armadillo first appeared in the arcade game SegaSonic the Hedgehog ( 1993 ) . Knuckles ' Chaotix was released in North America and Japan in April 1995 , and in Europe in June 1995 . It received mixed reviews and failed commercially .

  "/wiki/Sega_32X": "The 32X is an add-on for the Sega Genesis video game console . Codenamed Project Mars , the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the 32-bit era until the release of the Sega Saturn . Independent of the Genesis , the 32X uses its own ROM cartridges and has its own library of games . The add-on was distributed under the name Super 32X [ a ] in Japan , Genesis 32X in North America , Mega Drive 32X in the PAL region , and Mega 32X in Brazil . Unveiled by Sega at June 1994 's Consumer Electronics Show , the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games . Developed in response to the Atari Jaguar and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994 , the product was conceived as an entirely new console . At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team , the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful . The final design contained two 32-bit central processing units and a 3D graphics processor . To bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 1994 , development of the new system and its games was rushed . The console failed to attract third-party video game developers and consumers because of the announcement of the Sega Saturn 's simultaneous release in Japan . Sega 's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development , resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use the add-on 's hardware , including Genesis ports . Sega produced 800,000 units of the 32X and managed to sell an estimated 665,000 by the end of 1994 , selling the rest at steep discounts until it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn .",

Inspired by the Warcraft III : The Frozen Throne mod Defense of the Ancients , the game follows a freemium model and is supported by microtransactions . In League of Legends , players assume the role of a champion with unique abilities and battle against a team of other player- or computer-controlled champions . The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team 's Nexus , a structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures , although other distinct game modes exist as well with varying objectives , rules , and maps . Each League of Legends match is discrete , with all champions starting off relatively weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game . Champions span a variety of roles and blend a variety of fantasy tropes , such as sword and sorcery , steampunk , and Lovecraftian horror . Although the discrete nature of each match prohibits an overarching narrative in-game , the various champions make up a large and ever-evolving fictional universe developed by Riot Games through short stories , comics , cinematics , and books . Riot Games was founded by Brandon Ryze Beck and Marc Tryndamere Merill , former business students and roommates at the University of Southern California , in Los Angeles in September of 2006 . Citing a dissatisfaction with their post-college careers and the business practices of contemporary video game developers , they decided to create their own company dedicated to making free-to-play games that constantly evolved and developed through player feedback . Beck and Merill recruited Defense of the Ancients veteran Steve Guinsoo Feak , as well as several other experienced developers , to help them build and refine the game that would later become League of Legends . Development , originally under the name Onslaught , was difficult , owing to technical limitations and Beck and Merill 's conflicting visions with many publishers at the time .

[ note 1 ] Like many ancient Egyptian deities , Anubis assumed different roles in various contexts . Depicted as a protector of graves as early as the First Dynasty ( c. 3100 - c. 2890 BC ) , Anubis was also an embalmer . By the Middle Kingdom ( c. 2055 - 1650 BC ) he was replaced by Osiris in his role as lord of the underworld . One of his prominent roles was as a god who ushered souls into the afterlife . He attended the weighing scale during the Weighing of the Heart , in which it was determined whether a soul would be allowed to enter the realm of the dead . Despite being one of the most ancient and one of the most frequently depicted and mentioned gods in the Egyptian pantheon , Anubis played almost no role in Egyptian myths .

The game initially started development shortly following a successful relationship between Argonaut and Nintendo , with the former creating a processing chip for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System called the Super FX that was used in games such as Star Fox to display 3D polygonal environments . It was first pitched to Nintendo as a prototype for a 3D platform game in which the player controlled Yoshi from Nintendo 's Super Mario series , but was ultimately rejected by Nintendo , ending the relationship and prompting Argonaut to retool the game as an original property . The game 's characters and game mechanics were designed by Simon Keating in his first-ever video game project . Justin Scharvona composed the game 's music , while Jonathan Aris provided the voice of Croc . Croc : Legend of the Gobbos received average reviews from critics ; praise was directed towards the game 's visuals , music and sound , while criticism was directed towards the controls and camera . It went on to become one of Argonaut 's most successful releases , selling over 3 million copies for the PlayStation . A sequel to the game , titled Croc 2 , was released in 1999 .",
  "/wiki/Sega_Saturn": "The Sega Saturn [ a ] [ b ] is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console developed by Sega and released on November 22 , 1994 in Japan , May 11 , 1995 in North America , and July 8 , 1995 in Europe . The successor to the successful Sega Genesis , the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors . Its games are in CD-ROM format , and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games . Development of the Saturn began in 1992 , the same year Sega 's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted . The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi . Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",
