They are titled Crosby , Stills , Nash & Young ( CSNY ) when joined by Canadian singer-songwriter Neil Young as a fourth member . They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies , often tumultuous interpersonal relationships , political activism , and lasting influence on American music and culture . CSN formed in 1968 shortly after Crosby , Stills and Nash performed together informally in July of that year , discovering they harmonised well . Crosby had been asked to leave The Byrds in late 1967 , and Stills ' band Buffalo Springfield had broken up in early 1968 ; Nash left his band The Hollies in December , and by early 1969 the trio had signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records . Their first album , Crosby , Stills & Nash , was released in May 1969 , from which came two Top 40 hits , Suite : Judy Blue Eyes [ # 21 ] and Marrakesh Express [ # 28 ] . In order to tour the album , the trio hired drummer Dallas Taylor and session bassist Greg Reeves , though they still needed a keyboardist ; Ahmet Ertegun suggested Neil Young , who had played with Stills in Buffalo Springfield , and after some initial reluctance , the trio agreed , signing him on as a full member . The band , now named Crosby , Stills , Nash & Young , started their tour , and played their second gig at Woodstock Festival in the early morning hours of August 18 , 1969 . The first album with Young , D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu , reached number one in several international charts in 1970 , and remains their best selling album , going on to sell over 8 million copies three hit singles . Four singles were released from the album including Woodstock [ # 11 ] , Teach Your Children [ # 16 ] , and Our House [ # 30 ] . The group 's second tour , which produced the live double album 4 Way Street ( 1971 ) was fraught , with arguments between Young and Taylor , which resulted in Taylor being replaced by John Barbata , and tensions with Stills which resulted in his being temporarily dismissed from the band . At the end of the tour the band split up .",
