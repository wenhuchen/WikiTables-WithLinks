  "/wiki/Cathedral_Valley_Corral": "The Cathedral Valley Corral was constructed around 1900 by local cattlemen in the northern portion of what is now Capitol Reef National Park in Utah . It is one of the oldest examples of ranching use in the park . It coincided with a change in the use of the land , where cattle were grazed on the open range and collected into corrals for branding , vaccination and other procedures . The extensive use of open-range grazing practices led to the de-vegetation of portions of the area . The corral was used by the Jeffery and Morrel families . The corral site uses sandstone cliffs as part of the enclosure , with a wood fence closing off an alcove in a cliff . The pen is subdivided into a larger and smaller enclosure , with a cattle chute off the small pen . The Cathedral Valley Corral was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13 , 1999 .",

  "/wiki/Capitol_Reef_National_Park": "Capitol Reef National Park is an American national park in south-central Utah . The park is approximately 60 miles ( 97 km ) long on its north-south axis and just 6 miles ( 9.7 km ) wide on average . The park was established in 1971 to preserve 241,904 acres ( 377.98 sq mi ; 97,895.08 ha ; 978.95 km2 ) of desert landscape and is open all year , with May through September being the highest visitation months . Partially in Wayne County , Utah , the area was originally named Wayne Wonderland in the 1920s by local boosters Ephraim P. Pectol and Joseph S. Hickman . Capitol Reef National Park was designated a national monument on August 2 , 1937 , by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to protect the area 's colorful canyons , ridges , buttes , and monoliths ; however , it was not until 1950 that the area officially opened to the public . Road access was improved in 1962 with the construction of State Route 24 through the Fremont River Canyon . The majority of the nearly 100 mi ( 160 km ) long up-thrust formation called the Waterpocket Fold - a rocky spine extending from Thousand Lake Mountain to Lake Powell - is preserved within the park . Capitol Reef is an especially rugged and spectacular segment of the Waterpocket Fold by the Fremont River . The park was named for its whitish Navajo Sandstone cliffs with dome formations - similar to the white domes often placed on capitol buildings - that run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold . Locally , reef refers to any rocky barrier to land travel , just as ocean reefs are barriers to sea travel .",
