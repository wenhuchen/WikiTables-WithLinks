It was strongly influenced by Taoist philosophy , especially Neo-Daoist thought , and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism . From China , Ch\u00e1n spread south to Vietnam and became Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n , northeast to Korea to become Seon Buddhism , and east to Japan , becoming Japanese Zen . The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa ( Ch\u00e1n ) , which traces its roots to the Indian practice of dhy\u0101na ( meditation ) . [ note 1 ] Zen emphasizes rigorous self-restraint , meditation-practice , insight into the nature of mind ( Ch . jianxing , Jp . kensho , perceiving the true nature ) and nature of things , and the personal expression of this insight in daily life , especially for the benefit of others . As such , it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher . The teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought , especially Yogachara , the Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras , the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra , and the Huayan school , with their emphasis on Buddha-nature , totality , and the Bodhisattva-ideal .

From this room takes its name the shoin-zukuri style . In a shoin-zukuri building , the shoin is the zashiki , a tatami-room dedicated to the reception of guests . The emerging architecture of the Muromachi period was subsequently influenced by the increasing use and appearance of shoin . One of the most noticeable changes in architecture to arise from the shoin came from the practice of lining their floors with tatami mats . Since tatami mats have a standardized size the floor plans for shoin rooms had to be developed around the proportions of the tatami mat ; this in turn affected the proportions of doors , the height of rooms , and other aspects of the structure . Before the shoin popularized the practice of lining floors with tatami mats it had been standard to only bring out a single tatami mat for the highest-ranking person in the room to sit on . The architecture surrounding and influenced by the shoin quickly developed many other distinguishing features . Since the guests sat on the floor instead of on furniture , they were positioned at a lower vantage point than their Chinese counterparts who were accustomed to using furniture . This lower vantage point generated such developments as the suspended ceilings which functioned to make the room feel less expansive , and also resulted in the ceilings rafters being no longer visible as they were in China . The new suspended ceilings also allowed for more elaborate decoration , resulting in many highly ornate suspended ceilings in addition to the much simpler ones .",
