  "/wiki/Bring_the_Noise": "Bring the Noise is a song by the American hip hop group Public Enemy .

It later became the first song on the group 's 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back . The single reached No . 56 on the Billboard Hot R & B/Hip-Hop Songs chart . The song 's lyrics , most of which are delivered by Chuck D with interjections from Flavor Flav , include boasts of Public Enemy 's prowess , an endorsement of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan , retorts to unspecified critics , and arguments for rap as a legitimate musical genre on par with rock . The lyrics also have a notable metrical complexity , making extensive use of meters like dactylic hexameter . The title phrase appears in the chorus . The song includes several shout-outs to artists like Run-D.M.C. , Eric B , LL Cool J and , unusually for a rap group , Yoko Ono and thrash metal band Anthrax , allegedly because Chuck D was flattered about Scott Ian wearing Public Enemy shirts while performing Anthrax gigs . Anthrax later collaborated with Chuck D to cover the song . The song 's production by The Bomb Squad , which exemplifies their characteristic style , features a dissonant mixture of funk samples , drum machine patterns , record scratching by DJ Terminator X , siren sound effects and other industrial noise . Critic Robert Christgau has described the song as postminimal rap refracted through Blood Ulmer and On the Corner , as gripping as it is abrasive , and the black militant dialogue-as-diatribe that goes with it is almost as scary as Stones in My Passway or Holiday in the Sun .",

After experimenting as an adolescent with musicians he met between tours and recording sessions , Trucks founded The Derek Trucks Band in 1994 . With family ties to The Allman Brothers Band , Trucks continued to experiment and play with others , carefully assembling his own band over a period of several years . Led by Trucks and loosely based in his family home in Jacksonville , Florida , the band generally consisted of six members . The band drew upon the wide variety of the influences and musical preferences of its band members . Together , they have gained increasing public notice and critical acclaim for developing a unique sound of their own . Melding together blues , southern rock , jazz , rhythm and blues , gospel , soul , funk with Hindustani classical music , afro-beat and world fusion , the band has released six studio albums , two live albums , and a live DVD . The bandmates have combined their talents to perform pieces from some of the most highly regarded musicians before them , while at the same time collaborating on writing the songs they have recorded . The band 's eclectic sound is a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity alongside his role as a guest , and eventually a permanent member , in The Allman Brothers Band ."
