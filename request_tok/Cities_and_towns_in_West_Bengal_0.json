According to the 2011 Indian census , it is the seventh most populous city ; the city had a population of 4.5 million , while the suburb population brought the total to 14.1 million , making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in India . Kolkata Megalopolis is the area surrounding Kolkata Metropolitan city with additional population . Located on the east bank of the Hooghly River approximately 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) west of the border with Bangladesh , it is the principal commercial , cultural , and educational centre of East India , while the Port of Kolkata is India 's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port . The city , nicknamed the City of Joy is widely regarded as the cultural capital of India and as of 2019 , six Nobel Laureates have been associated with the city . Recent estimates of Kolkata Metropolitan Area 's economy have ranged from $ 60 to $ 150 billion ( GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity ) making it third most-productive metropolitan area in India , after Mumbai and Delhi . In the late 17th century , the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty . After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690 , the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post . Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756 , and the East India Company retook it the following year . In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat ( local rule ) , and assumed full sovereignty of the region . Under the company rule , and later under the British Raj , Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911 , when its perceived geographical disadvantages , combined with growing nationalism in Bengal , led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi . Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement ; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics .",
  "/wiki/Capital_(political)": "A capital or capital city is the municipality exercising primary status in a country , state , province , or other administrative region , usually as its seat of government . A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government 's offices and meeting places ; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution . In some jurisdictions , including several countries , the different branches of government are located in different settlements . In some cases , a distinction is made between the official ( constitutional ) capital and the seat of government , which is in another place . Capital cities that also serve as the prime economic , population , cultural , or intellectual centres of a nation or an empire are sometimes referred to as primate cities . Examples are Athens , Bangkok , Brussels , Copenhagen , Cairo , London , Mexico City , Paris , Lima , Seoul and Tokyo . News media often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there , as a form of metonymy . For example , relations between Washington and London refer to relations between the United States and the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/British_Raj": "The British Raj ( /r\u0251\u02d0d\u0292/ ; from r\u0101j , literally , rule in Sanskrit and Hindustani ) was the rule by the British Crown on the Indian subcontinent from 1858 to 1947 . The rule is also called Crown rule in India , or direct rule in India . The region under British control was commonly called India in contemporaneous usage , and included areas directly administered by the United Kingdom , which were collectively called British India , plus those ruled by indigenous rulers , but under British tutelage or paramountcy , called the princely states . The whole was never officially called the Indian Empire , only informally . As India , it was a founding member of the League of Nations , a participating nation in the Summer Olympics in 1900 , 1920 , 1928 , 1932 , and 1936 , and a founding member of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945 . This system of governance was instituted on 28 June 1858 , when , after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria ( who , in 1876 , was proclaimed Empress of India ) . It lasted until 1947 , when it was partitioned into two sovereign dominion states : the Dominion of India ( later the Republic of India ) and the Dominion of Pakistan ( later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , the eastern part of which , still later , became the People 's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971 ) . At the inception of the Raj in 1858 , Lower Burma was already a part of British India ; Upper Burma was added in 1886 , and the resulting union , Burma ( Myanmar ) , was administered as an autonomous province until 1937 , when it became a separate British colony , gaining its own independence in 1948 .",
