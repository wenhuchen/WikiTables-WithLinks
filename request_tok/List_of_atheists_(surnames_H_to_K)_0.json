  "/wiki/Catholic": "The Catholic Church , sometimes referred to as the Roman Catholic Church , is the largest Christian church , with approximately 1.3 billion baptised Catholics worldwide as of 2017 [ update ] . As the world 's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution , it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation . The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope . Its central administration is the Holy See . The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed . The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , [ note 1 ] that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles , and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ . It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith , reserving infallibility , passed down by sacred tradition . The Latin Church , the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches , and institutes such as mendicant orders , enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church . Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the principal one , celebrated liturgically in the Mass . The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ . The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven , honoured in dogmas and devotions . Its teaching includes Divine Mercy , sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel as well as Catholic social teaching , which emphasises voluntary support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy .",

  "/wiki/Secularist": "Secularism , as defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary , is indifference to , or rejection or exclusion of , religion and religious considerations .

As a philosophy , secularism seeks to interpret life on principles taken solely from the material world , without recourse to religion . Secularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as Zeno of Citium and Marcus Aurelius ; from Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke , Denis Diderot , Voltaire , Baruch Spinoza , James Madison , Thomas Jefferson , and Thomas Paine ; and from more recent freethinkers atheists such as Matthew W. Dillahunty , Robert Ingersoll , Bertrand Russell , and Christopher Hitchens . It shifts the focus from religion to other temporal and this-worldly things , with emphasis on nature , reason , science , and development . In political terms , secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institutions and religious dignitaries ( the attainment of such is termed secularity ) . Defined briefly , secularism means that governments should remain neutral on the matter of religion and should not enforce nor prohibit the free exercise of religion , leaving religious choice to the liberty of the people . One form of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings , or , in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief , from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people . [ Notes 1 ] Another form of secularism is the view that public activities and decisions , especially political ones , should be uninfluenced by religious beliefs or practices . [ Notes 2 ] There exist distinct traditions of secularism in the West ( e.g. , French and Anglo-American ) and beyond ( e.g. , in India ) . The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely .

  "/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick": "Stanley Kubrick ( /\u02c8ku\u02d0br\u026ak/ ; July 26 , 1928 - March 7 , 1999 ) was an American film director , screenwriter , and producer . He is frequently cited as one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history . His films , which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories , cover a wide range of genres , and are noted for their realism , dark humor , unique cinematography , extensive set designs , and evocative use of music . Kubrick was raised in the Bronx , New York City , and attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945 . He received average grades , but displayed a keen interest in literature , photography , and film from a young age , and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school . After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s , he began making short films on a shoestring budget , and made his first major Hollywood film , The Killing , for United Artists in 1956 . This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas , the war picture Paths of Glory ( 1957 ) and the historical epic Spartacus ( 1960 ) . His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew , and he was approached by Marlon Brando to film what would become One-Eyed Jacks ( 1961 ) , though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself . Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios , a dislike of the Hollywood industry , and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961 , where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career . His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire , which he shared with his wife Christiane , became his workplace , where he did his writing , research , editing , and management of production details . This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films , but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios . His first productions in Britain were two films with Peter Sellers , Lolita ( 1962 ) and Dr. Strangelove ( 1964 ) .",

It employs disturbing , violent images to comment on psychiatry , juvenile delinquency , youth gangs , and other social , political , and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain . Alex ( Malcolm McDowell ) , the central character , is a charismatic , antisocial delinquent whose interests include classical music ( especially Beethoven ) , committing rape , theft and what is termed ultra-violence .

The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang , his capture , and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological conditioning technique ( the Ludovico Technique ) promoted by the Minister of the Interior ( Anthony Sharp ) .

The film is based on Stephen King 's 1977 novel of the same name and stars Jack Nicholson , Shelley Duvall , Scatman Crothers , and Danny Lloyd . The central character in The Shining is Jack Torrance ( Nicholson ) , an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic , who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies . Wintering over with Jack are his wife , Wendy Torrance ( Duvall ) and young son , Danny Torrance ( Lloyd ) . Danny possesses the shining , psychic abilities that enable him to see into the hotel 's horrific past .

The hotel had a previous winter caretaker who went insane and killed his family and himself . After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound , Jack 's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel , placing his wife and son in danger . Production took place almost exclusively at EMI Elstree Studios , with sets based on real locations . Kubrick often worked with a small crew , which allowed him to do many takes , sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff . The new Steadicam mount was used to shoot several scenes , giving the film an innovative and immersive look and feel . There has been much speculation into the meanings and actions in the film because of inconsistencies , ambiguities , symbolism , and differences from the book .",
