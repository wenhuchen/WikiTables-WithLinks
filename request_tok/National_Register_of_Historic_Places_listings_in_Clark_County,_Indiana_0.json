  "/wiki/Abbott-Holloway_Farm": "The Abbott-Holloway Farm contains a couple of the few early structures still standing in Bethlehem , Indiana , located in the extreme northeast section of Clark County , Indiana . It overlooks the Ohio River . The land comprising the Abbott-Holloway Farm was first owned by Jonathan Clark , one of the early founders of Bethlehem in 1812 . The primary building on the lot is believed to have been built in 1830 by Asa Abbott ; records destroyed by the Ohio River flood of 1937 makes the exact date unknowable . When first built it was used as a store and post office , as Abbott was the postmaster for the town . Abbott is also believed to be the builder of the farm that also still stands . Due to fires and tornados , these buildings are among the few buildings constructed before 1840 still standing in Bethlehem ; only two other houses still stand from the time . After Abbott died in 1873 , control of the town went to his widowed daughter Athenatia ( Abbott ) Ross . With her 1885 marriage to Missouri man Fleming Holloway , they and his children moved to the farm . During their time of ownership several more barns were placed on the property , but most of those structures were destroyed in a tornado during the 20th century . Upon Athenatia 's 1899 death , Fleming gave up the house to his son Barnes Holloway , and moved to a smaller house on the property . In 1939 the farm was sold to Ira Church .",
