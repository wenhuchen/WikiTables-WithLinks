His unexpected rise to the presidency posed a threat to the presidential ambitions of Henry Clay and other politicians , and left Tyler estranged from both major political parties . Tyler was born to a prominent Virginia family and became a national figure at a time of political upheaval . In the 1820s , the nation 's only political party was the Democratic-Republican Party , and it split into factions . Tyler was initially a Democrat , but he opposed Andrew Jackson during the Nullification Crisis , seeing Jackson 's actions as infringing on states ' rights , and he criticized Jackson 's expansion of executive power during the Bank War . This led Tyler to ally with the Whig Party . He served as a Virginia state legislator , governor , U.S. representative , and U.S. senator . He was put on the 1840 presidential ticket to attract states ' rights Southerners to a Whig coalition to defeat Martin Van Buren 's re-election bid .

He served longer than any president in U.S. history not elected to the office ."
