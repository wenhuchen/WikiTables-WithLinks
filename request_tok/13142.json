He commanded several vessels within the territory of the Alaskan coastline . Following U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward 's Alaska purchase of the vast region in 1867 , Healy patrolled the 20,000 miles ( 32,000 km ) of Alaskan coastline for more than 20 years , earning great respect from the natives and seafarers alike . After commercial fishing had depleted the whale and seal populations , his assistance with the introduction of Siberian reindeer helped prevent starvation among the native Alaskans . The author Jack London was inspired by Healy 's command of the renowned USRC Bear . It was a thick wooden hulled , steam-and-sail powered proto-icebreaker , which had been put into service as a cutter , in 1884 . Nicknamed Hell Roaring Mike , Healy was the fifth of 10 children of the Healy family of Georgia , known for their achievements in the North after being born into slavery . Their parents were an Irish-born planter and his African-American mixed-race slave , with whom he had a common-law marriage .

  "/wiki/Marine_Corps": "Marines , also known as naval infantry , are typically an infantry force that specializes in the support of naval and army operations at sea and on land and air , as well as the execution of their own operations . In many countries , the marines are an integral part of that state 's navy . In others , it is a separate organization altogether , such as in the United States , where the Marine Corps falls under the US Department of the Navy , yet it operates independently ( and similarly the UK 's Royal Marines come under Her Majesty 's Naval Service ) . Marines can also fall under a country 's army like the Troupes de marine ( i.e . the French marines ) . Historically , tasks undertaken by marines have included : helping maintain discipline and order aboard the ship ( reflecting the pressed nature of the ships ' company and the risk of mutiny ) , the boarding of vessels during combat or capture of prize ships , and providing manpower for raiding ashore in support of the naval objectives . With the industrialization of warfare in the 20th century the scale of landing operations increased ; this brought with it an increased likelihood of opposition and a need for co-ordination of various military elements . Marine forces evolved to specialize in the skills and capabilities required for amphibious warfare .",
