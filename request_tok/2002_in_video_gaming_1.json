  "/wiki/Metroid_Prime": "Metroid Prime is an action-adventure game developed by Retro Studios and Nintendo for the GameCube . Metroid Prime is the fifth main installment in the Metroid series , and the first Metroid game to use 3D computer graphics being played from the first-person perspective . Because exploration takes precedence over combat , Nintendo classifies the game as a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter . It was released in North America in November 2002 , and in Japan and Europe the following year . On the same day as its North American release , Nintendo also released the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion , marking the return of the Metroid series after an eight-year hiatus following Super Metroid ( 1994 ) . Metroid Prime is the first of the three-part Prime storyline , which takes place between the original Metroid and Metroid II : Return of Samus . Like previous games in the series , Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran . The story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV . The game was a collaboration between Retro 's staff in Austin , Texas , and Japanese Nintendo employees , including producer Shigeru Miyamoto , who suggested the project after visiting Retro 's headquarters in 2000 . The game garnered critical praise and commercial success , selling more than a million units in North America alone . It won a number of Game of the Year awards , and it is considered by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games ever made , remaining one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic . In 2009 , an enhanced version was released for the Wii as a standalone game in Japan , and as part of the Metroid Prime Trilogy compilation internationally .",

The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium . The discs are in the miniDVD format and the system was not designed to play full-sized DVDs or audio CDs , unlike its competitors , and focused on gaming instead . The console supports limited online gaming for a small number of games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable , which allows players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller . The GameCube uses composite video cables to display games on the television ; however , there are differences in the two GameCube models . The models produced before May 2004 also have the ability to use digital component AV cables and progressive scan and a second serial port . The nameplate on the top of the console with the words Nintendo GameCube can be removed . This model is known as DOL-001 . The previously mentioned features were removed in GameCube consoles produced between 2004-2007 ; the later model was known as DOL-101 . The newer model has updated firmware that disables Action Replay cheats and cheat codes ( a newer version was developed to circumvent this ) and the disc-reading laser was improved in many ways , though it is not as durable .",

Activision was the first independent , third-party , console video game developer . The 1983 video game crash , in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision 's footsteps without the expertise of Activision 's founders , hurt Activision 's position in console games , forcing them to diversify into games for home computers , including the acquisition of Infocom . After a management shift , with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis , the company renamed itself as Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications . Mediagenic quickly fell into debt , and the company was bought for around US $ 500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991 . Kotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts : dismissing most of its staff , moving the company to Los Angeles , and reverting to the Activision name . Building on existing assets , the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and , after recovering from the former debt , started acquiring numerous studios and intellectual properties over the 1990s and 2000s , among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series .

  "/wiki/NFL_2K": "NFL 2K was an American football video game series developed by Visual Concepts and published by Sega . The series was originally exclusive to Sega 's Dreamcast video game console due to the absence of EA Sports 's Madden NFL series on the system . As the foremost 2K title , it marked the beginning of a running athletics series that eventually led to the spinning off of 2K 's sports publishing business under the name of 2K Sports . Upon the Dreamcast 's discontinuation , the series continued to be published for other sixth generation game systems and became the chief competitor of the Madden series . After the competitively priced NFL 2K5 significantly reduced sales of that year 's Madden release , EA signed an exclusivity deal with the NFL that made Madden NFL the only series allowed to use NFL team and player names . After losing the NFL license , Visual Concepts made a brief return to developing football games with the release of All-Pro Football 2K8 , which featured former NFL players on fictional teams .",
