  "/wiki/Water_shortage": "Water scarcity is the lack of fresh water resources to meet water demand . It affects every continent and was listed in 2019 by the World Economic Forum as one of the largest global risks in terms of potential impact over the next decade . It is manifested by partial or no satisfaction of expressed demand , economic competition for water quantity or quality , disputes between users , irreversible depletion of groundwater , and negative impacts on the environment . Two-thirds of the global population ( 4 billion people ) live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least 1 month of the year . Half a billion people in the world face severe water scarcity all year round . Half of the worlds largest cities experience water scarcity . A mere 0.014% of all water on Earth is both fresh and easily accessible . Of the remaining water , 97% is saline and a little less than 3% is hard to access . Technically , there is a sufficient amount of freshwater on a global scale . However , due to unequal distribution ( exacerbated by climate change ) resulting in some very wet and some very dry geographic locations , plus a sharp rise in global freshwater demand in recent decades driven by industry , humanity is facing a water crisis . Demand is expected to outstrip supply by 40% in 2030 , if current trends continue . The essence of global water scarcity is the geographic and temporal mismatch between freshwater demand and availability .",
  "/wiki/Drought": "A drought or drouth is an event of prolonged shortages in the water supply , whether atmospheric ( below-average precipitation ) , surface water or ground water . A drought can last for months or years , or may be declared after as few as 15 days . It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region and harm to the local economy . Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires . Periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour . Drought is a recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world . Many plant species , such as those in the family Cactaceae ( or cacti ) , have drought tolerance adaptations like reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought . Some others survive dry periods as buried seeds . Semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and grasslands . Prolonged droughts have caused mass migrations and humanitarian crisis . Most arid ecosystems have inherently low productivity . The most prolonged drought ever in the world in recorded history occurred in the Atacama Desert in Chile ( 400 Years ) .",

  "/wiki/Consumerism": "Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages an acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts . With the industrial revolution , but particularly in the 20th century , mass production led to overproduction - the supply of goods would grow beyond consumer demand , and so manufacturers turned to planned obsolescence and advertising to manipulate consumer spending . In 1899 , a book on consumerism published by Thorstein Veblen , called The Theory of the Leisure Class , examined the widespread values and economic institutions emerging along with the widespread leisure time in the beginning of the 20th century . In it Veblen views the activities and spending habits of this leisure class in terms of conspicuous and vicarious consumption and waste . Both are related to the display of status and not to functionality or usefulness . In economics , consumerism may refer to economic policies which emphasise consumption . In an abstract sense , it is the consideration that the free choice of consumers should strongly orient the choice by manufacturers of what is produced and how , and therefore orient the economic organization of a society ( compare producerism , especially in the British sense of the term ) . In this sense , consumerism expresses the idea not of one man , one voice , but of one dollar , one voice , which may or may not reflect the contribution of people to society .",

After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s , he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog ( 1956 ) , an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps . Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour ( 1959 ) , Last Year at Marienbad ( 1961 ) , and Muriel ( 1963 ) , all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past . These films were contemporary with , and associated with , the French New Wave ( la nouvelle vague ) , though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement . He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics . He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol , Marguerite Duras , Alain Robbe-Grillet , Jorge Sempr\u00fan and Jacques Sternberg . In later films , Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms , including theatre , music , and comic books . This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn , Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh , as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song . His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness , memory , and the imagination , and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives .

  "/wiki/Nuclear_warfare": "Nuclear warfare ( sometimes atomic warfare or thermonuclear warfare ) is a military conflict or political strategy in which nuclear weaponry is used to inflict damage on the enemy . Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction ; in contrast to conventional warfare , nuclear warfare can produce destruction in a much shorter time and can have a long-lasting radiological warfare result . A major nuclear exchange would have long-term effects , primarily from the fallout released , and could also lead to a nuclear winter that could last for decades , centuries , or even millennia after the initial attack . Some analysts dismiss the nuclear winter hypothesis , and calculate that even with nuclear weapon stockpiles at Cold War highs , although there would be billions of casualties , billions more rural people would nevertheless survive . However , others have argued that secondary effects of a nuclear holocaust , such as nuclear famine and societal collapse , would cause almost every human on Earth to starve to death . So far , two nuclear weapons have been used in the course of warfare , both by the United States near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , a uranium gun-type device ( code name Little Boy ) was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima . Three days later , on August 9 , a plutonium implosion-type device ( code name Fat Man ) was detonated over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These two bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 120,000 people . After World War II , nuclear weapons were also developed by the Soviet Union ( 1949 ) , the United Kingdom ( 1952 ) , France ( 1960 ) , and the People 's Republic of China ( 1964 ) , which contributed to the state of conflict and extreme tension that became known as the Cold War . In 1974 , India , and in 1998 , Pakistan , two countries that were openly hostile toward each other , developed nuclear weapons . Israel ( 1960s ) and North Korea ( 2006 ) are also thought to have developed stocks of nuclear weapons , though it is not known how many .",

This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar , and festivities took place on 21 December 2012 to commemorate the event in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization ( Mexico , Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvador ) , with main events at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala . Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed for this date . A New Age interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation , and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era . Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe . Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum , an interaction between Earth and the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , or Earth 's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru . Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of cataclysmic events as they arose . Mayan scholars stated that no classic Mayan accounts forecast impending doom , and the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Mayan history and culture . Astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience which is easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations .",

  "/wiki/Climate_change": "Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth 's climate system . It is a major aspect of climate change and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming . Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably . But , more accurately , global warming is the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation , while climate change includes both global warming and its effects , such as changes in precipitation . While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming , many observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented over decades to millennia . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded , It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that , during the 21st century , the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 \u00b0C ( 0.5 to 3.1 \u00b0F ) in a moderate scenario , or as much as 2.6 to 4.8 \u00b0C ( 4.7 to 8.6 \u00b0F ) in an extreme scenario , depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and on climate feedback effects . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing . The effects of global warming include rising sea levels , regional changes in precipitation , more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves , and expansion of deserts . Ocean acidification is also caused by greenhouse gas emissions and is commonly grouped with these effects even though it is not driven by temperature . Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic , which have contributed to the retreat of glaciers , permafrost , and sea ice .",

While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming , many observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented over decades to millennia . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded , It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that , during the 21st century , the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 \u00b0C ( 0.5 to 3.1 \u00b0F ) in a moderate scenario , or as much as 2.6 to 4.8 \u00b0C ( 4.7 to 8.6 \u00b0F ) in an extreme scenario , depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and on climate feedback effects . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing . The effects of global warming include rising sea levels , regional changes in precipitation , more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves , and expansion of deserts . Ocean acidification is also caused by greenhouse gas emissions and is commonly grouped with these effects even though it is not driven by temperature . Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic , which have contributed to the retreat of glaciers , permafrost , and sea ice .",

  "/wiki/Petroleum_industry": "The petroleum industry , also known as the oil industry or the oil patch , includes the global processes of exploration , extraction , refining , transporting ( often by oil tankers and pipelines ) , and marketing of petroleum products . The largest volume products of the industry are fuel oil and gasoline ( petrol ) . Petroleum ( oil ) is also the raw material for many chemical products , including pharmaceuticals , solvents , fertilizers , pesticides , synthetic fragrances , and plastics . The extreme monetary value of oil and its products has led to it being known as black gold . The industry is usually divided into three major components : upstream , midstream , and downstream . Upstream deals with Drilling and Production mainly . Petroleum is vital to many industries , and is necessary for the maintenance of industrial civilization in its current configuration , making it a critical concern for many nations . Oil accounts for a large percentage of the worlds energy consumption , ranging from a low of 32% for Europe and Asia , to a high of 53% for the Middle East . Other geographic regions ' consumption patterns are as follows : South and Central America ( 44% ) , Africa ( 41% ) , and North America ( 40% ) . The world consumes 30 billion barrels ( 4.8 km\u00b3 ) of oil per year [ citation needed ] , with developed nations being the largest consumers . The United States consumed 25% of the oil produced in 2007 . The production , distribution , refining , and retailing of petroleum taken as a whole represents the world 's largest industry in terms of dollar value .",
  "/wiki/Car_culture": "Since the start of the twentieth century , the role of the car has become highly important though controversial . It is used throughout the world and has become the most popular mode of transport in the more developed countries . In developing countries , the effects of the car on society are not as visible , however they are significant . The development of the car built upon the transport sector first started by railways . This has introduced sweeping changes in employment patterns , social interactions , infrastructure and the distribution of goods . Nonetheless the positive effects on access to remote places and mobility comfort provided by the automobile , allowing people to geographically increase their social and economic interactions , the negative effects of the car on everyday life are not negligible . Although the introduction of the mass-produced car represented a revolution in industry and convenience , creating job demand and tax revenue , the high motorisation rates also brought severe consequences to the society and to the environment . The modern negative consequences of heavy automotive use include the use of non-renewable fuels , a dramatic increase in the rate of accidental death , the disconnection of local community , the decrease of local economy , the rise in obesity and cardiovascular diseases , the emission of air and noise pollution , the emission of greenhouse gases , generation of urban sprawl and traffic , segregation of pedestrians and other active mobility means of transport , decrease in the railway network , urban decay and the high cost per unit-distance on which the car paradigm is based .",

  "/wiki/Energy": "In physics , energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on , or to heat , the object . [ note 1 ] Energy is a conserved quantity ; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form , but not created or destroyed . The SI unit of energy is the joule , which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton . Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object , the potential energy stored by an object 's position in a force field ( gravitational , electric or magnetic ) , the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects , the chemical energy released when a fuel burns , the radiant energy carried by light , and the thermal energy due to an object 's temperature . Mass and energy are closely related . Due to mass-energy equivalence , any object that has mass when stationary ( called rest mass ) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy , and any additional energy ( of any form ) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object 's total mass just as it increases its total energy . For example , after heating an object , its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass , with a sensitive enough scale . Living organisms require energy to stay alive , such as the energy humans get from food . Human civilization requires energy to function , which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels , nuclear fuel , or renewable energy . The processes of Earth 's climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_meltdown": "A nuclear meltdown ( core meltdown , core melt accident , meltdown or partial core melt ) is a severe nuclear reactor accident that results in core damage from overheating . The term nuclear meltdown is not officially defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency or by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . It has been defined to mean the accidental melting of the core of a nuclear reactor , however , and is in common usage a reference to the core 's either complete or partial collapse . A core meltdown accident occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear fuel element exceeds its melting point . This differs from a fuel element failure , which is not caused by high temperatures . A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant , loss of coolant pressure , or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits . Alternatively , an external fire may endanger the core , leading to a meltdown . Once the fuel elements of a reactor begin to melt , the fuel cladding has been breached , and the nuclear fuel ( such as uranium , plutonium , or thorium ) and fission products ( such as caesium-137 , krypton-85 , or iodine-131 ) within the fuel elements can leach out into the coolant . Subsequent failures can permit these radioisotopes to breach further layers of containment . Superheated steam and hot metal inside the core can lead to fuel-coolant interactions , hydrogen explosions , or water hammer , any of which could destroy parts of the containment . A meltdown is considered very serious because of the potential for radioactive materials to breach all containment and escape ( or be released ) into the environment , resulting in radioactive contamination and fallout , and potentially leading to radiation poisoning of people and animals nearby .",

  "/wiki/Climate_change_denial": "Climate change denial , or global warming denial is denial , dismissal , or unwarranted doubt that contradicts the scientific consensus on climate change , including the extent to which it is caused by humans , its effects on nature and human society , or the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions . Many who deny , dismiss , or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming self-label as climate change skeptics , which several scientists have noted is an inaccurate description . Climate change denial can also be implicit , when individuals or social groups accept the science but fail to come to terms with it or to translate their acceptance into action . Several social science studies have analyzed these positions as forms of denialism , pseudoscience , or propaganda . The campaign to undermine public trust in climate science has been described as a denial machine organized by industrial , political and ideological interests , and supported by conservative media and skeptical bloggers to manufacture uncertainty about global warming . The politics of global warming have been affected by climate change denial and the political global warming controversy , undermining the efforts to act on climate change or adapting to the warming climate . Those promoting denial commonly use rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of a scientific controversy where there is none . Organised campaigning to undermine public trust in climate science is associated with conservative economic policies and backed by industrial interests opposed to the regulation of CO2 emissions . Climate change denial has been associated with the fossil fuels lobby , the Koch brothers , industry advocates and conservative think tanks , often in the United States . More than 90% of papers sceptical on climate change originate from right-wing think tanks . Since the late 1970s , oil companies have published research broadly in line with the standard views on global warming . Despite this , oil companies organized a climate change denial campaign to disseminate public disinformation for several decades , a strategy that has been compared to the organized denial of the hazards of tobacco smoking by the tobacco industry .",

  "/wiki/Earthquake": "An earthquake ( also known as a quake , tremor or temblor ) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth 's lithosphere that creates seismic waves . Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they can not be felt to those violent enough to propel objects ( and people ) into the air , and wreak destruction across entire cities . The seismicity , or seismic activity , of an area is the frequency , type , and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time . The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling . At the Earth 's surface , earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground . When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore , the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami . Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally , volcanic activity . In its most general sense , the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event - whether natural or caused by humans - that generates seismic waves . Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity , landslides , mine blasts , and nuclear tests . An earthquake 's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter . The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter .",
