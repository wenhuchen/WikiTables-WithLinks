  "/wiki/First_Methodist_Protestant_Church_of_Seattle": "First Methodist Protestant Church of Seattle ( Capitol Hill United Methodist Church , Catalysis ) is an historic building , originally built and used as a church , at 128 16th Avenue East in Seattle , Washington . It was built in 1906 and added to the National Register in 1993 . The church that was originally housed in this building , First Methodist Protestant Church of Seattle , later known as Capitol Hill United Methodist Church , was founded by Rev . Daniel Bagley in 1865 and met in buildings in downtown Seattle until the construction of this building on Capitol Hill . In 1991 , due to declining membership and increasing costs of building upkeep , the church moved out of the building . The building was renovated from a church to an office building in 2004 , and is currently owned and occupied by Catalysis Corporation , a Seattle-based digital marketing agency . Neither the church nor the building should be confused with the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Seattle , which was founded in 1853 ( the first church organized in Seattle ) , which was also once housed in an historic building ( at Fifth Avenue and Marion Street in downtown Seattle ) built in 1906 . Prior to the construction of the 1906 buildings , when both congregations met downtown , they were disambiguated by calling the Methodist Episcopal church the Little White Church and the Methodist Protestant one the Little Brown Church . When the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Protestant Church became a single denomination in 1939 , the congregation that met in the Capitol Hill building that is the subject of this article changed their name from First Methodist Protestant to Capitol Hill Methodist , while the downtown Methodist Episcopal congregation became simply First Methodist Church ; decades later , another denominational merger led to both adding United to their names .",
