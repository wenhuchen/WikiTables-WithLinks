  "/wiki/Libertarianism": "Libertarianism ( from Latin : libertas , meaning freedom ) , or libertarism ( from French : libertaire , meaning libertarian ) , is a collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle . Libertarians seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy , emphasizing freedom of choice , voluntary association and individual judgement . Libertarians share a skepticism of authority and state power , but they diverge on the scope of their opposition to existing economic and political systems . Various schools of libertarian thought offer a range of views regarding the legitimate functions of state and private power , often calling for the restriction or dissolution of coercive social institutions . Different categorizations have been used to distinguish various forms of libertarianism . This is done to distinguish libertarian views on the nature of property and capital , usually along left-right or socialist-capitalist lines . Libertarianism originated as a form of left-wing politics such as anti-authoritarian and anti-state socialists like anarchists , especially social anarchists , but more generally libertarian communists/Marxists and libertarian socialists . These libertarians seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production , or else to restrict their purview or effects to usufruct property norms , in favor of common or cooperative ownership and management , viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty . Left-libertarian ideologies include anarchist schools of thought , alongside many other anti-paternalist , New Left schools of thought centered around economic egalitarianism as well as geolibertarianism , green politics , market-oriented left-libertarianism and the Steiner-Vallentyne school . In the mid-20th century , right-libertarian ideologies such as anarcho-capitalism and minarchism co-opted the term libertarian to advocate laissez-faire capitalism and strong private property rights such as in land , infrastructure and natural resources . The latter is the dominant form of libertarianism in the United States , where it advocates civil liberties , natural law , free-market capitalism and a major reversal of the modern welfare state .",
