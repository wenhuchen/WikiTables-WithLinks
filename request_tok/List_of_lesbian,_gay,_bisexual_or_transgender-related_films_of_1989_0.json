  "/wiki/HIV/AIDS": "Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms , or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness . Typically , this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms . If the infection progresses , it interferes more with the immune system , increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis , as well as other opportunistic infections , and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function . These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss . HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex ( including anal and oral sex ) , contaminated blood transfusions , hypodermic needles , and from mother to child during pregnancy , delivery , or breastfeeding . Some bodily fluids , such as saliva , sweat and tears , do not transmit the virus . HIV is a member of the group of viruses known as retroviruses . Methods of prevention include safe sex , needle exchange programs , treating those who are infected , pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis , and male circumcision . Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication . There is no cure or vaccine ; however , antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy .",
