During the second half of the first millennium Ceredigion was a minor kingdom . It has been administered as a county since 1282 . Welsh is spoken by more than half the population . Ceredigion is considered to be a centre of Welsh culture . The county is mainly rural with over 50 miles ( 80 km ) of coastline and a mountainous hinterland . The numerous sandy beaches and the long-distance Ceredigion Coast Path provide excellent views of Cardigan Bay . In the 18th and early 19th centuries , Cardiganshire had more industry than it does today ; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county ; lead , silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour . The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market . During the 20th century , livestock farming became less profitable , and the county 's population declined as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated . However , there has been a population increase caused by elderly people moving to the county for retirement , and various government initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income . Ceredigion 's population at the 2011 UK census was 75,900 .",

The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .",

It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England .

Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points . The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics , and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing , Cornish pilot gig rowing , sea kayaking and powerboating .",
  "/wiki/Sovereign_(British_coin)": "The sovereign is a gold coin of the United Kingdom , with a nominal value of one pound sterling . Struck from 1817 until the present time , it was originally a circulating coin accepted in Britain and elsewhere in the world ; it is now a bullion coin and is sometimes mounted in jewellery . In most recent years , it has borne the design of Saint George and the Dragon on the reverse ; the initials ( B P ) of the designer , Benedetto Pistrucci , are visible to the right of the date . The coin was named after the English gold sovereign , last minted about 1603 , and originated as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816 . Many in Parliament believed a one-pound coin should be issued rather than the 21-shilling ( 1.05 pounds ) guinea struck until that time . The Master of the Mint , William Wellesley Pole , had Pistrucci design the new coin , and his depiction was also used for other gold coins . Originally , the coin was unpopular as the public preferred the convenience of banknotes , but paper currency of value \u00a31 was soon limited by law . With that competition gone , the sovereign not only became a popular circulating coin , but was used in international trade and in foreign lands , trusted as a coin containing a known quantity of gold . The British government promoted the use of the sovereign as an aid to international trade , and the Royal Mint took steps to see that lightweight gold coins were withdrawn from circulation . From the 1850s until 1932 , the sovereign was also struck at colonial mints , initially in Australia , and later in Canada , South Africa and India - they have been struck again in India since 2013 ( in addition to the production in Britain by the Royal Mint ) for the local market . The sovereigns issued in Australia initially carried a unique local design , but by 1887 , all new sovereigns bore Pistrucci 's George and Dragon design . Strikings there were so large that by 1900 , about 40 per cent of the sovereigns in Britain had been minted in Australia .",
