  "/wiki/Sawmill": "A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber . Modern saw mills use a motorized saw to cut logs lengthwise to make long pieces , and crosswise to length depending on standard or custom sizes ( dimensional lumber ) . The portable saw mill is iconic and of simple operation - the logs lay flat on a steel bed and the motorized saw cuts the log horizontally along the length of the bed , by the operator manually pushing the saw . The most basic kind of saw mill consists of a chainsaw and a customized jig ( Alaskan saw mill ) , with similar horizontal operation . Before the invention of the sawmill , boards were made in various manual ways , either rived ( split ) and planed , hewn , or more often hand sawn by two men with a whipsaw , one above and another in a saw pit below . The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill , a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis , Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD . Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa , the Middle East and Central Asia , and in the next few centuries , spread across Europe . The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade . Generally , only the saw was powered , and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand . An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage , also water powered , to move the log steadily through the saw blade . By the time of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century , the circular saw blade had been invented , and with the development of steam power in the 19th century , a much greater degree of mechanisation was possible . Scrap lumber from the mill provided a source of fuel for firing the boiler .",
  "/wiki/Contributing_property": "In the law regulating historic districts in the United States , a contributing property or contributing resource is any building , object , or structure which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make the historic district , listed locally or federally , significant . Government agencies , at the state , national , and local level in the United States , have differing definitions of what constitutes a contributing property but there are common characteristics . Local laws often regulate the changes that can be made to contributing structures within designated historic districts . The first local ordinances dealing with the alteration of buildings within historic districts was in Charleston , South Carolina in 1931 . Properties within a historic district fall into one of two types of property : contributing and non-contributing . A contributing property , such as a 19th-century mansion , helps make a historic district historic , while a non-contributing property , such as a modern medical clinic , does not . The contributing properties are key to a historic district 's historic associations , historic architectural qualities , or archaeological qualities . A property can change from contributing to non-contributing and vice versa if significant alterations take place .",

  "/wiki/Tudor_Revival_architecture": "Tudor Revival architecture ( also known as mock Tudor in the UK ) first manifested itself in domestic architecture in the United Kingdom in the latter half of the 19th century . Based on revival of aspects that were perceived as Tudor architecture , in reality it usually took the style of English vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages that had survived into the Tudor period . The style later became an influence elsewhere , especially the British colonies . For example , in New Zealand , the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate . In Singapore , then a British colony , architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House . The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey , in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design . Tudorbethan is a subset of Tudor Revival architecture that eliminated some of the more complex aspects of Jacobethan in favor of more domestic styles of Merrie England , which were cosier and quaint .

  "/wiki/Half-timbered": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers , creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs . It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century . If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered , and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect . The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany . Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast . The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber . Hewing this with broadaxes , adzes , and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers ( brace and bit ) and other woodworking tools , artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building .

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/Classical_Revival": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament .

Especially for middle-sized houses , the style includes the English version of Queen Anne style architecture . Sir Christopher Wren presided over the genesis of the English Baroque manner , which differed from the continental models by clarity of design and subtle taste for classicism . Following the Great Fire of London , Wren rebuilt fifty-three churches , where Baroque aesthetics are apparent primarily in dynamic structure and multiple changing views . His most ambitious work was St Paul 's Cathedral ( 1675-1711 ) , which bears comparison with the most effulgent domed churches of Italy and France . In this majestically proportioned edifice , the Palladian tradition of Inigo Jones is fused with contemporary continental sensibilities in masterly equilibrium . Less influential were straightforward attempts to engraft the Berniniesque vision onto British church architecture ( e.g. , by Thomas Archer in St. John 's , Smith Square , 1728 ) and the contemporary mood soon shifted toward the stripped down orthodoxy of British Palladianism popularised by Colen Campbell 's influential Vitruvius Britannicus . Baroque aesthetics , whose influence was so potent in mid-17th century France , made little impact in England during the Protectorate and the first Restoration years . [ citation needed ] Colen Campbell writing in 1715 declared the Italians had lost all taste for architecture in the pursuit of capricious novelties .

This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater ( 1935 ) , which has been called the best all-time work of American architecture . As a founder of organic architecture , Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century , influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works . Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture , and he also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City , his unique vision for urban planning in the United States . In addition to his houses , Wright designed original and innovative offices , churches , schools , skyscrapers , hotels , museums , and other structures . He often designed interior elements for these buildings , as well , including furniture and stained glass . Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe . Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as the greatest American architect of all time . In 2019 , a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright . Raised in rural Wisconsin , Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago with noted architects Joseph Lyman Silsbee and Louis Sullivan . He opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 , and developed an influential home and studio in Oak Park , Illinois .",
  "/wiki/Usonian": "Usonia ( /ju\u02d0\u02c8so\u028ani\u0259/ ) is a word that was used by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright to refer to the United States in general ( in preference to America ) , and more specifically to his vision for the landscape of the country , including the planning of cities and the architecture of buildings . Wright proposed the use of the adjective Usonian to describe the particular New World character of the American landscape as distinct and free of previous architectural conventions .",

  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",

  "/wiki/Second_Empire_architecture": "The Napoleon III style , also known as the Second Empire style , was a highly eclectic style of architecture and decorative arts , which used elements of many different historical styles , and also made innovative use of modern materials , such as iron frameworks and glass skylights . It flourished during the reign of Emperor Napoleon III in France ( 1852-1871 ) and had an important influence on architecture and decoration in the rest of Europe and the United States . Major examples of the style include the Op\u00e9ra Garnier ( 1862-1871 ) in Paris by Charles Garnier , the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France , and the Church of Saint Augustine ( 1860-1871 ) . The architectural style was closely connected with Haussmann 's renovation of Paris carried out during the Second Empire ; the new buildings , such as the opera , were intended as the focal points of the new boulevards .",

It is composed of nine federated states ( Bundesl\u00e4nder ) , one of which is Vienna , Austria 's capital and its largest city . It is bordered by Germany to the northwest , Czech Republic to the north , Slovakia to the northeast , Hungary to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

  "/wiki/Shingle_style": "The Shingle style is an American architectural style made popular by the rise of the New England school of architecture , which eschewed the highly ornamented patterns of the Eastlake style in Queen Anne architecture . In the Shingle style , English influence was combined with the renewed interest in Colonial American architecture which followed the 1876 celebration of the Centennial . The plain , shingled surfaces of colonial buildings were adopted , and their massing emulated . Aside from being a style of design , the style also conveyed a sense of the house as continuous volume . This effect - of the building as an envelope of space , rather than a great mass , was enhanced by the visual tautness of the flat shingled surfaces , the horizontal shape of many Shingle style houses , and the emphasis on horizontal continuity , both in exterior details and in the flow of spaces within the houses .",
  "/wiki/Wisconsin_River": "The Wisconsin River is a tributary of the Mississippi River in the U.S. state of Wisconsin . At approximately 430 miles ( 692 km ) long , it is the state 's longest river . The river 's name , first recorded in 1673 by Jacques Marquette as Meskousing , is rooted in the Algonquian languages used by the area 's American Indian tribes , but its original meaning is obscure . French explorers who followed in the wake of Marquette later modified the name to Ouisconsin , and so it appears on Guillaume de L'Isle 's map ( Paris , 1718 ) . This was simplified to Wisconsin in the early 19th century before being applied to Wisconsin Territory and finally the state of Wisconsin . The Wisconsin River originates in the forests of the North Woods Lake District of northern Wisconsin , in Lac Vieux Desert near the border of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan . It flows south across the glacial plain of central Wisconsin , passing through Wausau , Stevens Point , and Wisconsin Rapids . In southern Wisconsin it encounters the terminal moraine formed during the last ice age , where it forms the Dells of the Wisconsin River . North of Madison at Portage , the river turns to the west , flowing through Wisconsin 's hilly Western Upland and joining the Mississippi approximately 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) south of Prairie du Chien . The highest waterfall on the river is Grandfather Falls in Lincoln County .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",
  "/wiki/Eastlake_Movement": "The Eastlake Movement was a nineteenth-century architectural and household design reform movement started by British architect and writer Charles Eastlake ( 1836-1906 ) . The movement is generally considered part of the late Victorian period in terms of broad antique furniture designations . In architecture the Eastlake Style or Eastlake architecture is part of the Queen Anne style of Victorian architecture . Eastlake 's book Hints on Household Taste in Furniture , Upholstery , and Other Details posited that furniture and decor in people 's homes should be made by hand or machine workers who took personal pride in their work . Manufacturers in the United States used the drawings and ideas in the book to create mass-produced Eastlake Style or Cottage furniture . The geometric ornaments , spindles , low relief carvings , and incised lines were designed to be affordable and easy to clean ; nevertheless , many of the designs which resulted are artistically complex .",
  "/wiki/Bargeboard": "Bargeboard ( probably from Medieval Latin bargus , or barcus , a scaffold , and not from the now obsolete synonym vergeboard ) is a board fastened to the projecting gables of a roof to give them strength , protection , and to conceal the otherwise exposed end of the horizontal timbers or purlins of the roof to which they were attached . Bargeboards are sometimes moulded only or carved , but as a rule the lower edges were cusped and had tracery in the spandrels besides being otherwise elaborated . An example in Britain was one at Ockwells in Berkshire ( built 1446-1465 ) , which was moulded and carved as if it were intended for internal work . In New Orleans , bargeboard is the wood from which many of the creole cottages were constructed in the early to mid-1800s . Barges were constructed up-river to carry goods to New Orleans , and upon arrival dismantled and used for construction of houses . The planks are generally 2 inches ( 5.1 cm ) thick and of varying lengths and widths , although 10 inches ( 25 cm ) width is common . It is hard , solid wood that has lasted between 150 and 200 years in a wet , humid climate . [ citation needed ]",
