  "/wiki/South_Gloucestershire": "South Gloucestershire is a unitary authority area in South West England . It comprises multiple suburban areas to the north and east of Bristol as well as a large rural hinterland . South Gloucestershire was created in 1996 from the northern section of the county of Avon , which was abolished at that time . The area includes multiple towns and population centres , with many of these areas continuing to expand in both population and industry . Many of these towns and population areas are listed under two major subheadings below . South Gloucestershire took its title for historic reasons , but as a unitary authority it is not administered as part of the shire county of Gloucestershire . It is , however , part of the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire , which means it shares its Lord Lieutenant ( the Sovereign 's representative to the county ) with Gloucestershire . Because of its history as part of the county of Avon , South Gloucestershire works closely with the other unitary authorities that took over when that county was abolished , including shared services such as Avon Fire and Rescue Service and the Avon and Somerset Constabulary , together with co-operation in planning strategy for transport , roads and housing .",
  "/wiki/Aerospace": "Aerospace is the human effort in science , engineering , and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth ( aeronautics ) and surrounding space ( astronautics ) . Aerospace organizations research , design , manufacture , operate , or maintain aircraft or spacecraft . Aerospace activity is very diverse , with a multitude of commercial , industrial and military applications . Aerospace is not the same as airspace , which is the physical air space directly above a location on the ground . The beginning of space and the ending of the air is considered as 100 km above the ground according to the physical explanation that the air pressure is too low for a lifting body to generate meaningful lift force without exceeding orbital velocity .",
  "/wiki/Filton_Airfield": "Filton Airport or Filton Aerodrome ( IATA : FZO , ICAO : EGTG ) was a private airport on the border between Filton and Patchway , within South Gloucestershire , 4 NM ( 7.4 km ; 4.6 mi ) north of Bristol , England . The airfield was bordered by the A38 road to the East , and the former London to Avonmouth railway line to the South . To the North it was bordered by the Filton Bypass . A major road now dissects this bypass , running across former airfield land and enabling a Filton and Patchway link to Cribbs Causeway . The housing development of Charlton Hayes is being built on the section of the airfield that is in the town of Patchway . The airfield had a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Ordinary Licence ( number P741 ) allowing flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee . Several private jets had the airfield as their home . Filton 's runway is wider than most , at 91 m ( 300 ft ) , and is a considerable length at 2,467 m ( 8,094 ft ) long , having been extended for the maiden flight of the Bristol Brabazon airliner in 1949 . Its size was also important in the late 1960s and early 1970s for development and manufacture of the supersonic Concorde . Filton had a succession of owners . Following a review of its commercial viability , the last owners , BAE Systems Aviation Services Limited , decided to close the airfield for business effective 31 December 2012 . BAE left the site , selling parts of the industrial buildings and land to Airbus , who have expanded their presence there .",
  "/wiki/Concorde": "The A\u00e9rospatiale/BAC Concorde ( /\u02c8k\u0252\u014bk\u0254\u02d0rd/ ) is a British-French turbojet-powered supersonic passenger airliner that was operated until 2003 . It had a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound , at Mach 2.04 ( 1,354 mph or 2,180 km/h at cruise altitude ) , with seating for 92 to 128 passengers . First flown in 1969 , Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued flying for the next 27 years . It is one of only two supersonic transports to have been operated commercially ; the other is the Soviet-built Tupolev Tu-144 , which operated in the late 1970s . Concorde was jointly developed and manufactured by Sud Aviation ( later A\u00e9rospatiale ) and the British Aircraft Corporation ( BAC ) under an Anglo-French treaty . Twenty aircraft were built , including six prototypes and development aircraft . Air France ( AF ) and British Airways ( BA ) were the only airlines to purchase and fly Concorde . The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for the aircraft 's speed and luxury service . For example , in 1997 , the round-trip ticket price from New York to London was $ 7,995 ( $ 12.7 thousand in 2019 dollars ) , more than 30 times the cost of the cheapest option to fly this route . The original programme cost estimate of \u00a370 million met huge overruns and delays , with the program eventually costing \u00a31.3 billion . It was this extreme cost that became the main factor in the production run being much smaller than anticipated . Later , another factor , which affected the viability of all supersonic transport programmes , was that supersonic flight could only be used on ocean-crossing routes , to prevent sonic boom disturbance over populated areas .",
  "/wiki/Aeroplanes": "An airplane or aeroplane ( informally plane ) is a powered , fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine , propeller or rocket engine . Airplanes come in a variety of sizes , shapes , and wing configurations . The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation , transportation of goods and people , military , and research . Worldwide , commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually , which is less than 1% of the world 's cargo movement . Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft , but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones . The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903 , recognized as the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight . They built on the works of George Cayley dating from 1799 , when he set forth the concept of the modern airplane ( and later built and flew models and successful passenger-carrying gliders ) . Between 1867 and 1896 , the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal also studied heavier-than-air flight . Following its limited use in World War I , aircraft technology continued to develop . Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II . The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178 in 1939 . The first jet airliner , the de Havilland Comet , was introduced in 1952 .",
  "/wiki/Helicopters": "A helicopter , or chopper , is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors . This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically , to hover , and to fly forward , backward , and laterally . These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL ( Vertical TakeOff and Landing ) aircraft can not perform . The English word helicopter is adapted from the French word h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re , coined by Gustave Ponton d'Am\u00e9court in 1861 , which originates from the Greek helix ( \u1f15\u03bb\u03b9\u03be ) helix , spiral , whirl , convolution and pteron ( \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd ) wing . English language nicknames for helicopter include chopper , copter , helo , heli , and whirlybird . Helicopters were developed and built during the first half-century of flight , with the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936 . Some helicopters reached limited production , but it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production , with 131 aircraft built . Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor , it is the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration . Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity . Coaxial helicopters , tiltrotor aircraft , and compound helicopters are all flying today . Quadcopter helicopters were pioneered as early as 1907 in France , and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones .",
  "/wiki/Guided_weapons": "A precision-guided munition ( PGM , smart weapon , smart munition , smart bomb ) is a guided munition intended to precisely hit a specific target , to minimize collateral damage and increase lethality against intended targets . During the First Gulf War guided munitions accounted for only 9% of weapons fired , but accounted for 75% of all successful hits . Despite guided weapons generally being used on more difficult targets , they were still 35 times more likely to destroy their targets per weapon dropped . Because the damage effects of explosive weapons decrease with distance due to an inverse cube law , even modest improvements in accuracy ( hence reduction in miss distance ) enable a target to be attacked with fewer or smaller bombs . Thus , even if some guided bombs miss , fewer air crews are put at risk and the harm to civilians and the amount of collateral damage may be reduced . The advent of precision-guided munitions resulted in the renaming of older bombs unguided bombs , dumb bombs , or iron bombs . Notable precision guided munitions builders are the US , Russia , Israel , Iran , China , among others .",

  "/wiki/Bristol_Harbour": "Bristol Harbour is the harbour in the city of Bristol , England . The harbour covers an area of 70 acres ( 28.3 ha ) . It has existed since the 13th century but was developed into its current form in the early 19th century by installing lock gates on a tidal stretch of the River Avon in the centre of the city and providing a tidal by-pass for the river . It is often called the Floating Harbour as the water level remains constant and it is not affected by the state of the tide on the river . Netham Lock in east Bristol is the upstream limit of the harbour . Beyond the lock is a junction : on one arm the navigable River Avon continues upstream to Bath , and on the other arm is the tidal River Avon . The first 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) of the floating harbour , downstream from Netham Lock to Totterdown Basin , is an artificial canal known as the Feeder Canal , while the tidal River Avon follows its original route . Downstream of Totterdown Basin , the floating harbour occupies the former natural course of the River Avon , whilst the tidal River Avon flows through an artificial channel known as the New Cut . This separation of the floating harbour and the tidal River Avon allows boats in the harbour to remain floating at low tide , reduces currents and silting and prevents flooding . Between Bristol Temple Meads railway station and Hotwells , the harbour and the River Avon run parallel at a distance of no more than 0.65 miles ( 1.0 km ) apart .

The city borders North Somerset and South Gloucestershire , with the cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east , respectively . South Wales lies across the Severn estuary . Iron Age hill forts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the rivers Frome and Avon , and around the beginning of the 11th century , the settlement was known as Brycgstow ( Old English the place at the bridge ) . Bristol received a royal charter in 1155 and was historically divided between Gloucestershire and Somerset until 1373 when it became a county of itself . From the 13th to the 18th century , Bristol was among the top three English cities , after London , in tax receipts . Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of Birmingham , Manchester and Liverpool in the Industrial Revolution . Bristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World .

  "/wiki/Tea": "Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis , an evergreen shrub ( bush ) native to East Asia . After water , it is the most widely consumed drink in the world . There are many different types of tea ; some , like Darjeeling and Chinese greens , have a cooling , slightly bitter , and astringent flavour , while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet , nutty , floral or grassy notes . Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content . Tea originated in Southwest China during the Shang dynasty , where it was used as a medicinal drink . An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD , in a medical text written by Hua Tuo . It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty , and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries . Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century . During the 17th century , drinking tea became fashionable among Britons , who started large-scale production and commercialisation of the plant in India . Combined , China and India supplied 62% of the world 's tea in 2016 . The term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis : infusions of fruit , leaves , or other parts of the plant , such as steeps of rosehip , chamomile , or rooibos . These are sometimes called tisanes or herbal infusions to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant .",

He is one of the early innovators of what became known as Early Netherlandish painting , and one of the most significant representatives of Early Northern Renaissance art . The surviving records of his early life indicate that he was born around 1380-1390 , most likely in Maaseik ( then Maaseyck , hence his name ) , in present-day Belgium . He took employment in the Hague around 1422 , when he was already a master painter with workshop assistants , and employed as painter and valet de chambre with John III the Pitiless , ruler of Holland and Hainaut . He was then employed in Lille as court painter to Philip the Good , Duke of Burgundy after John 's death in 1425 , until he moved to Bruges in 1429 where he lived until his death . He was highly regarded by Philip and undertook a number of diplomatic visits abroad , including to Lisbon in 1428 to explore the possibility of a marriage contract between the duke and Isabella of Portugal . About 20 surviving paintings are confidently attributed to him , as well as the Ghent Altarpiece and the illuminated miniatures of the Turin-Milan Hours , all dated between 1432 and 1439 . Ten are dated and signed with a variation of his motto ALS ICH KAN ( As I ( Eyck ) can ) , a pun on his name , which he typically painted in Greek characters . Van Eyck painted both secular and religious subject matter , including altarpieces , single-panel religious figures and commissioned portraits . His work includes single panels , diptychs , triptychs , and polyptych panels . He was well paid by Philip , who sought that the painter was secure financially and had artistic freedom so that he could paint whenever he pleased . Van Eyck 's work comes from the International Gothic style , but he soon eclipsed it , in part through a greater emphasis on naturalism and realism .",
  "/wiki/The_Arnolfini_Portrait": "The Arnolfini Portrait ( or The Arnolfini Wedding , The Arnolfini Marriage , the Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife , or other titles ) is a 1434 oil painting on oak panel by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck . It forms a full-length double portrait , believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife , presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges . It is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art , because of its beauty , complex iconography , geometric orthogonal perspective , and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror . According to Ernst Gombrich in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello 's or Masaccio 's work in Italy . A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic . For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term . The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract , recorded as a painting . Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434 , it is , with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert , the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera . The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842 . Van Eyck used the technique of applying several layers of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour . The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism , and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini 's world . Van Eyck took advantage of the longer drying time of oil paint , compared to tempera , to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms .",

It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel , its coastline facing southeastern Wales . Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon . Somerset 's county town is Taunton . Somerset is a rural county of rolling hills , the Blackdown Hills , Mendip Hills , Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park , and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels . There is evidence of human occupation from Paleolithic times , and of subsequent settlement by the Celts , Romans and Anglo-Saxons . The county played a significant part in Alfred the Great 's rise to power , and later the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion .

  "/wiki/Mansion": "A mansion is a large dwelling house . The word itself derives through Old French from the Latin word mansio dwelling , an abstract noun derived from the verb manere to dwell . The English word manse originally defined a property large enough for the parish priest to maintain himself , but a mansion is no longer self-sustaining in this way ( compare a Roman or medieval villa ) . Manor comes from the same root - territorial holdings granted to a lord who would remain there .",
  "/wiki/Estate_(house)": "Historically , an estate comprises the houses , outbuildings , supporting farmland , and woods that surround the gardens and grounds of a very large property , such as a country house or mansion . It is the modern term for a manor , but lacks a manor 's now-abolished jurisdictional authority . It is an estate because the profits from its produce and rents are sufficient to support the household in the house at its center , formerly known as the manor house . Thus , the estate may refer to all other cottages and villages in the same ownership as the mansion itself , covering more than one former manor . Examples of such great estates are Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire , England , and Blenheim Palace , in Oxfordshire , England , built to replace the former manor house of Woodstock . Estate , with its stately home connotations , has been a natural candidate for inflationary usage during the 20th century . The term estate properly alludes to estates comprising several farms , and is not well used to describe a single farm . More generally and usually in modern times , an estate is any large packet of land in single ownership : see",

These include prehistoric sites , medieval castles , Roman forts and country houses . The charity states that it uses these properties to bring the story of England to life for over 10 million people each year . Within its portfolio are Stonehenge , Dover Castle , Tintagel Castle and the best preserved parts of Hadrian 's Wall . English Heritage also manages the London Blue Plaque scheme , which links influential historical figures to particular buildings . When originally formed in 1983 , English Heritage was the operating name of an executive non-departmental public body of the British Government , officially titled the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England , that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties . It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection . In 1999 the organisation merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England and the National Monuments Record , bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England 's historic environment . On 1 April 2015 , English Heritage was divided into two parts : Historic England , which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation , and the new English Heritage Trust , a charity that would operate the historic properties , and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo . The British government gave the new charity an \u00a380 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust , although the historic properties remained in the ownership of the state .",

  "/wiki/Science": "Science ( from the Latin word scientia , meaning knowledge ) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe . The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE . Their contributions to mathematics , astronomy , and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity , whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries ( 400 to 1000 CE ) of the Middle Ages but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age . The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy , which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions . The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape ; along with the changing of natural philosophy to natural science . Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences ( e.g. , biology , chemistry , and physics ) , which study nature in the broadest sense ; the social sciences ( e.g. , economics , psychology , and sociology ) , which study individuals and societies ; and the formal sciences ( e.g. , logic , mathematics , and theoretical computer science ) , which study abstract concepts . There is disagreement , however , on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence . Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes , such as engineering and medicine , are described as applied sciences . Science is based on research , which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies . The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products , armaments , health care , and environmental protection .",

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques , processes , and the like , or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings . Systems ( e. g. machines ) applying technology by taking an input , changing it according to the system 's use , and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems . The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools . The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food , and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment . Developments in historic times , including the printing press , the telephone , and the Internet , have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale . Technology has many effects . It has helped develop more advanced economies ( including today 's global economy ) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class . Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth 's environment . Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology . Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity , and the challenges of bioethics . Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology , with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it .",

Forces applied to objects result in displacements , or changes of an object 's position relative to its environment . This branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece with the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes ( see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics ) . During the early modern period , scientists such as Galileo , Kepler , and Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics . It is a branch of classical physics that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light . It can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm . The field is yet less widely understood in terms of quantum theory .",

  "/wiki/Space": "Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction . Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions , although modern physicists usually consider it , with time , to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime . The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe . However , disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity , a relationship between entities , or part of a conceptual framework . Debates concerning the nature , essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity ; namely , to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato , or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called kh\u00f4ra ( i.e . space ) , or in the Physics of Aristotle ( Book IV , Delta ) in the definition of topos ( i.e . place ) , or in the later geometrical conception of place as space qua extension in the Discourse on Place ( Qawl fi al-Makan ) of the 11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen . Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century , particularly during the early development of classical mechanics . In Isaac Newton 's view , space was absolute - in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space . Other natural philosophers , notably Gottfried Leibniz , thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects , given by their distance and direction from one another . In the 18th century , the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the visibility of spatial depth in his Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision . Later , the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world - they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences .",

  "/wiki/Rainforests": "Rainforests are forests characterized by high and continuous rainfall , with annual rainfall in the case of tropical rainforests between 2.5 and 4.5 metres ( 98 and 177 in ) and definitions varying by region for temperate rainforests . The monsoon trough , alternatively known as the intertropical convergence zone , plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the Earth 's tropical rainforests : which are distinct from monsoonal areas of seasonal tropical forest . Estimates vary from 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests . There may be many millions of species of plants , insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests . Tropical rainforests have been called the jewels of the Earth and the world 's largest pharmacy , because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there . Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world 's oxygen turnover , sometimes misnamed oxygen production , processing it through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide and consuming it through respiration . The undergrowth in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of sunlight to ground level . If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned , the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense , tangled growth of vines , shrubs and small trees , called a jungle . The term jungle is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally . Rainforests as well as endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to deforestation , the resulting habitat loss and pollution of the atmosphere .",

  "/wiki/IMAX": "IMAX is a proprietary system of high-resolution cameras , film formats , film projectors , and theaters known for having very large screens with a tall aspect ratio ( approximately 1.43:1 & 1.90:1 ) and steep stadium seating . Graeme Ferguson , Roman Kroitor , Robert Kerr , and William C. Shaw were the co-founders of what would be named the IMAX Corporation ( founded in September 1967 as Multiscreen Corporation , Limited ) , and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Canada . Unlike conventional film projectors , the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock . When IMAX was introduced , it was a radical change in the movie-going experience . Viewers were treated to the scene of a gently-curved giant screen more than seven stories tall ( 75 feet ( 23 m ) , with the tallest measuring 117 feet ( 36 m ) ) and steep stadium seating that made for a visually immersive experience . This was enhanced by a sound system that was far superior to the audio at typical theaters in the years prior to the advent of THX . Some IMAX theaters have a hemispheric dome screen geometry , which can give the viewer an even more immersive feel . Over the decades since its introduction , IMAX evolved to include 3D stereoscopic films , introduced in January 1998 , and then began to proliferate with a transition away from analog film into the digital era . Beginning in May 1991 , a visceral dimension of the movie experience was added by having the audience 's seats mounted on a full-motion platform as an amusement park ride in IMAX ride film theaters . With the advent of digital projection , the IMAX brand has also been applied to lower-resolution imaging systems , causing some degree of confusion among the viewing public .",

Some movie theaters , however , are operated by non-profit organizations or societies that charge members a membership fee to view films . The film is projected with a movie projector onto a large projection screen at the front of the auditorium while the dialogue , sounds and music are played through a number of wall-mounted speakers . Since the 1970s , subwoofers have been used for low-pitched sounds . In the 2010s , most movie theaters are equipped for digital cinema projection , removing the need to create and transport a physical film print on a heavy reel . A great variety of films are shown at cinemas , ranging from animated films to blockbusters to documentaries . The smallest movie theaters have a single viewing room with a single screen .

Austen 's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security . Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism . [ b ] Her use of biting irony , along with her realism , humour , and social commentary , have long earned her acclaim among critics , scholars , and popular audiences alike . With the publications of Sense and Sensibility ( 1811 ) , Pride and Prejudice ( 1813 ) , Mansfield Park ( 1814 ) and Emma ( 1816 ) , she achieved success as a published writer . She wrote two additional novels , Northanger Abbey and Persuasion , both published posthumously in 1818 , and began another , eventually titled Sanditon , but died before its completion . She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript , a short epistolary novel Lady Susan , and another unfinished novel , The Watsons . Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print , although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime . A significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833 , when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley 's Standard Novels series , illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering , and sold as a set . They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership . In 1869 , fifty-two years after her death , her nephew 's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience . Austen has inspired many critical essays and literary anthologies .",
  "/wiki/Northanger_Abbey": "Northanger Abbey ( /\u02c8n\u0254\u02d0r\u03b8\u00e6\u014b\u0259r/ ) was the first of Jane Austen 's novels to be completed for publication , in 1803 . However , it was not published until after her death in 1855 , along with another novel of hers , Persuasion . Northanger Abbey is a satire of Gothic novels , which were quite popular at the time , in 1898-99 . This coming-of-age story revolves around Catherine Morland , a young and na\u00efve heroine , who entertains the reader on her journey to a better understanding of the world and those around her . In the course of the novel , she discovers that she differs from those other women who crave wealth or social acceptance , as instead she wishes only to have happiness supported by genuine morality . Austen first titled the novel Susan , when she sold it in 1803 for \u00a310 to a London bookseller , Crosby & Co . This publisher did not print the work but held on to the manuscript . Austen reportedly threatened to take her work back from them , but Crosby & Co responded that she would face legal consequences for reclaiming her text . In the spring of 1816 , the bookseller sold it back to the novelist 's brother , Henry Austen , for the same sum as they had paid for it . There is evidence that Austen further revised the novel in 1816-1817 with the intention of having it published . She rewrote sections , renaming the main character Catherine and using that as her working title . After her death , Austen 's brother Henry gave the novel its final name and arranged for publication of Northanger Abbey in late December 1817 ( 1818 given on the title page ) , as the first two volumes of a four-volume set , with a preface for the first time publicly identifying Jane Austen as the author of all her novels .",

  "/wiki/Victorian_era": "In the history of the United Kingdom , the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign , from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901 . The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine . Between 1837 and 1901 about 15 million emigrated from Great Britain , mostly to the United States , Canada , South Africa , New Zealand , and Australia .",

  "/wiki/Natural_history": "Natural history is a domain of inquiry involving organisms , including animals , fungi and plants , in their natural environment , leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study . A person who studies natural history is called a naturalist or natural historian . Natural history encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it . It involves the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms . So while it dates from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world , through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation , today 's natural history is a cross discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences ; e.g. , geobiology has a strong multi-disciplinary nature .",
  "/wiki/Archaeology": "Archaeology , or archeology , is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture . The archaeological record consists of artifacts , architecture , biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes . Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities . In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines , while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology . Archaeologists study human prehistory and history , from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades . Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology , which is the study of fossil remains . It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies , for whom there may be no written records to study . Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past , from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world . Archaeology has various goals , which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time . The discipline involves surveying , excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past . In broad scope , archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research . It draws upon anthropology , history , art history , classics , ethnology , geography , geology , literary history , linguistics , semiology , sociology , textual criticism , physics , information sciences , chemistry , statistics , paleoecology , paleography , paleontology , paleozoology , and paleobotany .",
  "/wiki/Edwardian": "The Edwardian era or Edwardian period of British history spanned the reign of King Edward VII , 1901 to 1910 , and is sometimes extended to the start of the First World War . The death of Queen Victoria in January 1901 marked the end of the Victorian era . Her son and successor , Edward VII , was already the leader of a fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europe . Samuel Hynes described the Edwardian era as a leisurely time when women wore picture hats and did not vote , when the rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously , and the sun really never set on the British flag . The Liberals returned to power in 1906 and made significant reforms . Below the upper class , the era was marked by significant shifts in politics among sections of society that had largely been excluded from power , such as labourers , servants , and the industrial working class . Women started to play more of a role in politics .",
  "/wiki/Baroque_architecture": "Baroque architecture is a highly decorative and theatrical style which appeared in Italy in the early 17th century and gradually spread across Europe . It was originally introduced by the Catholic Church , particularly by the Jesuits , as a means to combat the Reformation and the Protestant church with a new architecture that inspired surprise and awe . It reached its peak in the High Baroque ( 1625-1675 ) , when it was used in churches and palaces in Italy , Spain , Portugal and France , and Austria . In the Late Baroque period ( 1675-1750 ) , it reached as far as Russia and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Latin America , Beginning in about 1730 , an even more elaborately decorative variant called Rococo appeared and flourished in Central Europe . Baroque architects took the basic elements of Renaissance architecture , including domes and colonnades , and made them higher , grander , more decorated , and more dramatic . The interior effects were often achieved with the use of quadratura , or trompe-l'oeil painting combined with sculpture ; The eye is drawn upward , giving the illusion that one is looking into the heavens . Clusters of sculpted angels and painted figures crowd the ceiling . Light was also used for dramatic effect ; it streamed down from cupolas , and was reflected from an abundance of gilding . Twisted columns were also often used , to give an illusion of upwards motion , and cartouches and other decorative elements occupied every available space . In Baroque palaces , grand stairways became a central element . The Early Baroque ( 1584-1625 ) was largely dominated by the work of Roman architects , notably the Church of the Ges\u00f9 by Giacomo della Porta ( consecrated 1584 ) facade and colonnade of St. Peter 's Basilica by Carlo Maderno ( completed 1612 ) and the lavish Barberini Palace interiors by Pietro da Cortona ( 1633-1639 ) .

  "/wiki/Slate_industry_in_Wales": "The existence of a slate industry in Wales is attested since the Roman period , when slate was used to roof the fort at Segontium , now Caernarfon . The slate industry grew slowly until the early 18th century , then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century , at which time the most important slate producing areas were in northwest Wales , including the Penrhyn Quarry near Bethesda , the Dinorwic Quarry near Llanberis , the Nantlle Valley quarries , and Blaenau Ffestiniog , where the slate was mined rather than quarried . Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest slate quarries in the world , and the Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest slate mine in the world . Slate is mainly used for roofing , but is also produced as thicker slab for a variety of uses including flooring , worktops and headstones . Up to the end of the 18th century , slate was extracted on a small scale by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord , carted slate to the ports , and then shipped it to England , Ireland and sometimes France . Towards the close of the century , the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves , on a larger scale . After the government abolished slate duty in 1831 , rapid expansion was propelled by the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates to the ports . The slate industry dominated the economy of north-west Wales during the second half of the 19th century , but was on a much smaller scale elsewhere . In 1898 , a work force of 17,000 men produced half a million tons of slate . A bitter industrial dispute at the Penrhyn Quarry between 1900 and 1903 marked the beginning of its decline , and the First World War saw a great reduction in the number of men employed in the industry . The Great Depression and Second World War led to the closure of many smaller quarries , and competition from other roofing materials , particularly tiles , resulted in the closure of most of the larger quarries in the 1960s and 1970s . Slate production continues on a much reduced scale .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",

  "/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy": "Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) , formerly known as electroshock therapy , is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from mental disorders . Typically , 70 to 120 volts are applied externally to the patient 's head resulting in approximately 800 milliamperes of direct current passed through the brain , for 100 milliseconds to 6 seconds duration , either from temple to temple ( bilateral ECT ) or from front to back of one side of the head ( unilateral ECT ) . The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 and rapidly replaced less safe and effective forms of biological treatments in use at the time . ECT is often used with informed consent as a safe and effective intervention for major depressive disorder , mania , and catatonia . ECT machines were originally placed in the Class III category by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) since 1976 . They were re-classified as Class II devices , for treatment of catatonia , major depressive disorder , and bipolar disorder , in 2018 . A course of ECT is effective for about 50% of people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder , whether it is unipolar or bipolar . Follow-up treatment is still poorly studied , but about half of people who respond relapse within 12 months . Aside from effects in the brain , the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia . :259 Immediately following treatment , the most common adverse effects are confusion and transient memory loss .

Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

  "/wiki/John_Wesley": "John Wesley ( /\u02c8w\u025bsli/ ; 28 June [ O.S . 17 June ] 1703 - 2 March 1791 ) was an English cleric , theologian and evangelist who was a leader of a revival movement within the Church of England known as Methodism . The societies he founded became the dominant form of the independent Methodist movement that continues to this day . Educated at Charterhouse and Christ Church , Oxford , Wesley was elected a fellow of Lincoln College , Oxford in 1726 and ordained as an Anglican priest two years later . He led the Holy Club , a society formed for the purpose of study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life ; it had been founded by his brother , Charles , and counted George Whitefield among its members . After an unsuccessful ministry of two years at Savannah in the Georgia Colony , Wesley returned to London and joined a religious society led by Moravian Christians . On 24 May 1738 he experienced what has come to be called his evangelical conversion , when he felt his heart strangely warmed . He subsequently left the Moravians , beginning his own ministry . A key step in the development of Wesley 's ministry was , like Whitefield , to travel and preach outdoors . In contrast to Whitefield 's Calvinism , Wesley embraced Arminian doctrines . Moving across Great Britain and Ireland , he helped form and organise small Christian groups that developed intensive and personal accountability , discipleship and religious instruction ; most importantly , he appointed itinerant , unordained evangelists to care for these groups of people . Under Wesley 's direction , Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day , including prison reform and the abolition of slavery .",
  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Pulpit": "A pulpit is a raised stand for preachers in a Christian church . The origin of the word is the Latin pulpitum ( platform or staging ) . The traditional pulpit is raised well above the surrounding floor for audibility and visibility , accessed by steps , with sides coming to about waist height . From the late medieval period onwards , pulpits have often had a canopy known as the sounding board or abat-voix above and sometimes also behind the speaker , normally in wood . Though sometimes highly decorated , this is not purely decorative , but can have a useful acoustic effect in projecting the preacher 's voice to the congregation below . Most pulpits have one or more book-stands for the preacher to rest his or her bible , notes or texts upon . The pulpit is generally reserved for clergy . This is mandated in the regulations of the Roman Catholic church , and several others ( though not always strictly observed ) . Even in Welsh Nonconformism , this was felt appropriate , and in some chapels a second pulpit was built opposite the main one for lay exhortations , testimonials and other speeches . Many churches have a second , smaller stand called the lectern , which can be used by lay persons , and is often used for all the readings and ordinary announcements . The traditional Catholic location of the pulpit to the side of the chancel or nave has been generally retained by Anglicans and some Protestant denominations , while in Presbyterian and Evangelical churches the pulpit has often replaced the altar at the centre . Equivalent platforms for speakers are the bema ( bima , bimah ) of Ancient Greece and Jewish synagogues , and the minbar of Islamic mosques .",

He was a younger brother of Methodist founder John Wesley and Anglican cleric Samuel Wesley the Younger , and he became the father of musician Samuel Wesley and grandfather of musician Samuel Sebastian Wesley . Wesley was educated at Oxford where his brothers had also studied , and he formed the Holy Club among his fellow students in 1729 . John Wesley later joined this group , as did George Whitefield . Charles followed his father and brother into the church in 1735 , and he travelled with John to Georgia in America , returning a year later . In 1749 , he married Sarah Gwynne , daughter of a Welsh gentleman who had been converted to Methodism by Howell Harris . She accompanied the brothers on their evangelistic journeys throughout Britain until Charles ceased to travel in 1765 . Despite their closeness , Charles and John did not always agree on questions relating to their beliefs . In particular , Charles was strongly opposed to the idea of a breach with the Church of England into which they had been ordained .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",
  "/wiki/Reform_school": "A reform school was a penal institution , generally for teenagers mainly operating between 1830 and 1900 . In the United Kingdom and its colonies reformatories commonly called reform schools were set up from 1854 onwards for youngsters who were convicted of a crime as an alternative to an adult prison . In parallel , Industrial schools were set up for vagrants and children needing protection . Both were 'certified ' by the government from 1857 , and in 1932 the systems merged and both were 'approved ' and became approved schools . Both in the United Kingdom and United States , they came out of social concerns about cities , poverty , immigration , and vagrancy following industrialization , as well as from a shift in society 's attitude from retribution , punishing the miscreant to reforming . They were distinct from borstals ( 1902-1982 UK ) , which were enclosed juvenile prisons .",

Although the policy was originally envisaged as increasing the regular income of the Crown , much former monastic property was sold off to fund Henry 's military campaigns in the 1540s . He was given the authority to do this in England and Wales by the Act of Supremacy , passed by Parliament in 1534 , which made him Supreme Head of the Church in England , thus separating England from Papal authority , and by the First Suppression Act ( 1535 ) and the Second Suppression Act ( 1539 ) .

  "/wiki/Elizabethan": "The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor period of the history of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I ( 1558-1603 ) . Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history . The symbol of Britannia ( a female personification of Great Britain ) was first used in 1572 , and often thereafter , to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals , international expansion , and naval triumph over Spain . The historian John Guy ( 1988 ) argues that England was economically healthier , more expansive , and more optimistic under the Tudors than at any time in a thousand years . This golden age represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of poetry , music and literature . The era is most famous for theatre , as William Shakespeare and many others composed plays that broke free of England 's past style of theatre . It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad , while back at home , the Protestant Reformation became more acceptable to the people , most certainly after the Spanish Armada was repelled . It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland . The Elizabethan age contrasts sharply with the previous and following reigns . It was a brief period of internal peace between the English Reformation and the religious battles between Protestants and Catholics and then the political battles between parliament and the monarchy that engulfed the remainder of the seventeenth century . The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled , for a time , by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism . England was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe .",

  "/wiki/Newlyn_School": "The Newlyn School was an art colony of artists based in or near Newlyn , a fishing village adjacent to Penzance , on the south coast of Cornwall , from the 1880s until the early twentieth century . The establishment of the Newlyn School was reminiscent of the Barbizon School in France , where artists fled Paris to paint in a more pure setting emphasizing natural light . These schools along with a related California movement were also known as En plein air . Some of the first British artists to settle in the area had already travelled in Brittany , but found in Newlyn a comparable English environment with a number of things guaranteed to attract them : fantastic light , cheap living , and the availability of inexpensive models . The artists were fascinated by the fishermen 's working life at sea and the everyday life in the harbour and nearby villages . Some paintings showed the hazards and tragedy of the community 's life , such as women anxiously looking out to sea as the boats go out , or a young woman crying on hearing news of a disaster . Walter Langley is generally recognised as the pioneer of the Newlyn art colony and Stanhope Forbes , who settled there in 1884 , as the father of it . The later Forbes School of Painting , founded by Forbes and his wife Elizabeth in 1899 , promoted the study of figure painting . A present-day Newlyn School of Art was formed in 2011 with Arts Council funding providing art courses taught by many of the best-known artists working in Cornwall today .

She was the first iron steamer to cross the Atlantic , which she did in 1845 , in the time of 14 days . The ship is 322 ft ( 98 m ) in length and has a 3,400-ton displacement . She was powered by two inclined 2 cylinder engines of the direct-acting type , with twin high pressure cylinders ( diameter uncertain ) and twin low pressure cylinders 88 in ( 220 cm ) bore , all of 6-foot ( 1.8 m ) stroke cylinders . She was also provided with secondary masts for sail power . The four decks provided accommodation for a crew of 120 , plus 360 passengers who were provided with cabins , and dining and promenade saloons . When launched in 1843 , Great Britain was by far the largest vessel afloat . But her protracted construction time of six years ( 1839-1845 ) and high cost had left her owners in a difficult financial position , and they were forced out of business in 1846 , having spent all their remaining funds refloating the ship after she ran aground at Dundrum Bay in County Down near Newcastle in what is now Northern Ireland , after a navigation error . In 1852 she was sold for salvage and repaired .",
  "/wiki/Ocean_liner": "An ocean liner is a passenger ship primarily used as a form of transportation across seas or oceans . Liners may also carry cargo or mail , and may sometimes be used for other purposes ( such as for pleasure cruises or as hospital ships ) . Cargo vessels running to a schedule are sometimes called liners . The category does not include ferries or other vessels engaged in short-sea trading , nor dedicated cruise ships where the voyage itself , and not transportation , is the prime purpose of the trip . Nor does it include tramp steamers , even those equipped to handle limited numbers of passengers . Some shipping companies refer to themselves as lines and their container ships , which often operate over set routes according to established schedules , as liners . Ocean liners are usually strongly built with a high freeboard to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean . Additionally , they are often designed with thicker hull plating than is found on cruise ships , and have large capacities for fuel , food and other consumables on long voyages . The first ocean liners were built in the mid-19th century . Technological innovations such as the steam engine and steel hull allowed larger and faster liners to be built , giving rise to a competition between world powers of the time , especially between the United Kingdom and Germany . Once the dominant form of travel between continents , ocean liners were rendered largely obsolete by the emergence of long-distance aircraft after World War II . Advances in automobile and railway technology also played a role .",
  "/wiki/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel": "Isambard Kingdom Brunel FRS ( /\u02c8\u026az\u0259mb\u0251\u02d0rd bru\u02d0\u02c8n\u025bl/ ; 9 April 1806 - 15 September 1859 ) was a British civil engineer who is considered one of the most ingenious and prolific figures in engineering history , one of the 19th-century engineering giants , and one of the greatest figures of the Industrial Revolution , [ who ] changed the face of the English landscape with his groundbreaking designs and ingenious constructions . Brunel built dockyards , the Great Western Railway , a series of steamships including the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship , and numerous important bridges and tunnels . His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering . Though Brunel 's projects were not always successful , they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems . During his career , Brunel achieved many engineering firsts , including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a navigable river and development of SS Great Britain , the first propeller-driven , ocean-going , iron ship , which , when built in 1843 , was the largest ship ever built . Brunel set the standard for a well-built railway , using careful surveys to minimise gradients and curves . This necessitated expensive construction techniques , new bridges , new viaducts , and the two-mile ( 3.2 km ) long Box Tunnel . One controversial feature was the wide gauge , a broad gauge of 7 ft 1\u20444 in ( 2,140 mm ) , instead of what was later to be known as standard gauge of 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) . He astonished Britain by proposing to extend the Great Western Railway westward to North America by building steam-powered , iron-hulled ships . He designed and built three ships that revolutionised naval engineering : the SS Great Western ( 1838 ) , the SS Great Britain ( 1843 ) , and the SS Great Eastern ( 1859 ) . In 2002 , Brunel was placed second in a BBC public poll to determine the 100 Greatest Britons . In 2006 , the bicentenary of his birth , a major programme of events celebrated his life and work under the name Brunel 200 .",
  "/wiki/Great_Western_Steamship_Company": "The Great Western Steam Ship Company operated the first regular transatlantic steamer service from 1838 until 1846 . Related to the Great Western Railway , it was expected to achieve the position that was ultimately secured by the Cunard Line . The firm 's first ship , Great Western was capable of record Blue Riband crossings as late as 1843 and was the model for Cunard 's Britannia and her three sisters . The company 's second steamer , the Great Britain was an outstanding technical achievement of the age . The company collapsed because it failed to secure a mail contract and Great Britain appeared to be a total loss after running aground . The company might have had a more successful outcome had it built sister ships for Great Western instead of investing in the too advanced Great Britain .",
  "/wiki/Transatlantic_crossing": "Transatlantic crossings are passages of passengers and cargo across the Atlantic Ocean between Europe or Africa and the Americas . The majority of passenger traffic is across the North Atlantic between Western Europe and North America . Centuries after the dwindling of sporadic Viking trade with Markland , a regular and lasting transatlantic trade route was established in 1566 with the Spanish West Indies fleets , following the Voyages of Christopher Columbus .",

With an estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748 distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles ( 784 km2 ) , New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States . Located at the southern tip of the U.S. state of New York , the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area , the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass and one of the world 's most populous megacities , with an estimated 19,979,477 people in its 2018 metropolitan statistical area and 22,679,948 residents in its combined statistical area . A global power city , New York City has been described as the cultural , financial , and media capital of the world , and exerts a significant impact upon commerce , entertainment , research , technology , education , politics , tourism , art , fashion , and sports . The city 's fast pace has inspired the term New York minute . Home to the headquarters of the United Nations , New York is an important center for international diplomacy . Situated on one of the world 's largest natural harbors , New York City consists of five boroughs , each of which is a separate county of the State of New York . The five boroughs - Brooklyn , Queens , Manhattan , The Bronx , and Staten Island - were consolidated into a single city in 1898 .

  "/wiki/Screw_propeller": "A propeller is a device with a rotating hub and radiating blades that are set at a pitch to form a helical spiral , that when rotated performs an action which is similar to Archimedes ' screw . It transforms rotational power into linear thrust by acting upon a working fluid such as water or air . The rotational motion of the blades is converted into thrust by creating a pressure difference between the two surfaces . A given mass of working fluid is accelerated in one direction and the craft moves in the opposite direction . Propeller dynamics , like those of aircraft wings , can be modelled by Bernoulli 's principle and Newton 's third law . Most marine propellers are screw propellers with helical blades rotating around an approximately horizontal axis or propeller shaft .",
  "/wiki/Navigation": "Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another . The field of navigation includes four general categories : land navigation , marine navigation , aeronautic navigation , and space navigation . It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge used by navigators to perform navigation tasks . All navigational techniques involve locating the navigator 's position compared to known locations or patterns . Navigation , in a broader sense , can refer to any skill or study that involves the determination of position and direction . In this sense , navigation includes orienteering and pedestrian navigation .",
  "/wiki/Marine_salvage": "Marine salvage is the process of recovering a ship and its cargo after a shipwreck or other maritime casualty . Salvage may encompass towing , re-floating a vessel , or effecting repairs to a ship . Today , protecting the coastal environment from spillage of oil or other contaminants is a high priority . Before the invention of radio , salvage services would be given to a stricken vessel by any ship that happened to be passing by . Nowadays , most salvage is carried out by specialist salvage firms with dedicated crew and equipment . The legal significance of salvage is that a successful salvor is entitled to a reward , which is a proportion of the total value of the ship and its cargo . The amount of the award is determined subsequently at a hearing on the merits by a maritime court in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of the International Salvage Convention of 1989 . The common law concept of salvage was established by the English Admiralty Court , and is defined as a voluntary successful service provided in order to save maritime property in danger at sea , entitling the salvor to a reward ; and this definition has been further refined by the 1989 Convention . Originally , a successful salvage was one where at least some of the ship or cargo was saved , otherwise the principle of No Cure , No Pay meant that the salvor would get nothing . In the 1970s , a number of marine casualties of single-skin-hull tankers led to serious oil spills . Such casualties were unattractive to salvors , so the Lloyd 's Open Form ( LOF ) made provision that a salvor who acts to try to prevent environmental damage will be paid , even if unsuccessful . This Lloyd 's initiative proved so advantageous that it was incorporated into the 1989 Convention .",
  "/wiki/Immigration_to_Australia": "Immigration to Australia began when the ancestors of Indigenous Australians arrived on the continent via the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia and New Guinea . Permanent European settlement began in 1788 with the establishment of a British penal colony in New South Wales . From early federation in 1901 , Australia maintained the White Australia policy , which forbid the entrance in Australia of people of non-European ethnic origins and was abolished after World War II . Since 1945 , more than 7 million people have settled in Australia . From the late 1970s , there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries , making Australia a multicultural country . Net overseas migration has increased from 30,042 in 1992-93 to 178,582 persons in 2015-16 . The largest components of immigration are the skilled migration and family re-union programs . A 2014 sociological study concluded that : Australia and Canada are the most receptive to immigration among western nations . Australia is a signatory to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and has resettled many asylum seekers . In recent years , Australia 's policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals by boat has attracted controversy . On 7 August 2018 , the Australian Bureau of Statistics population clock reached 25 million , with 62% of the growth in the last ten years being a result of immigration . The milestone was 33 years ahead of schedule .",

The principal islands are about 300 miles ( 483 kilometres ) east of South America 's southern Patagonian coast , and about 752 miles ( 1,210 kilometres ) from the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula , at a latitude of about 52\u00b0S . The archipelago , with an area of 4,700 square miles ( 12,000 square kilometres ) , comprises East Falkland , West Falkland and 776 smaller islands . As a British overseas territory , the Falklands have internal self-governance , and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs . The Falkland Islands ' capital is Stanley on East Falkland . Controversy exists over the Falklands ' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans . At various times , the islands have had French , British , Spanish , and Argentine settlements . Britain reasserted its rule in 1833 , but Argentina maintains its claim to the islands . In April 1982 , Argentine military forces invaded the islands . British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War . Almost all Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory . Its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Hulk_(ship)": "A hulk is a ship that is afloat , but incapable of going to sea . Although sometimes used to describe a ship that has been launched but not completed , the term most often refers to an old ship that has had its rigging or internal equipment removed , retaining only its buoyant qualities . The word hulk is also used as a verb : a ship is hulked to convert it to a hulk . The verb was also applied to crews of Royal Navy ships in dock , who were sent to the receiving ship for accommodation , or hulked . Hulks have a variety of uses such as housing , prisons , salvage pontoons , gambling sites , naval training , or cargo storage . Although the term hulk can be used to refer to an abandoned wreck or shell , it is much more commonly applied to hulls that are still performing a useful function . In the days of sail , many hulls served longer as hulks than they did as functional ships . Wooden ships were often hulked when the hull structure became too old and weak to withstand the stresses of sailing . More recently , ships have been hulked when they become obsolete or when they become uneconomical to operate .",
  "/wiki/Scuttling": "Scuttling is the deliberate sinking of a ship by allowing water to flow into the hull . This can be achieved in several ways - seacocks or hatches can be opened to the sea , or holes may be ripped into the hull with brute force or with explosives . Scuttling may be performed to dispose of an abandoned , old , or captured vessel ; to prevent the vessel from becoming a navigation hazard ; as an act of self-destruction to prevent the ship from being captured by an enemy force ( or , in the case of a vessel engaged in illegal activities , by the authorities ) ; as a blockship to restrict navigation through a channel or within a harbor ; to provide an artificial reef for divers and marine life ; or to alter the flow of rivers .",

  "/wiki/Museum_ship": "A museum ship , also called a memorial ship , is a ship that has been preserved and converted into a museum open to the public for educational or memorial purposes . Some are also used for training and recruitment purposes , mostly for the small number of museum ships that are still operational and thus capable of regular movement . Several hundred museum ships are kept around the world , with around 175 of them organised in the Historic Naval Ships Association though many are not naval museum ships , from general merchant ships to tugs and lightships . Many , if not most , museum ships are also associated with a maritime museum ."
