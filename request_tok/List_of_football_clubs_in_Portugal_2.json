  "/wiki/Caldas_das_Taipas": "Caldas das Taipas ( officially : Caldelas ) is a civil parish in the municipality of Guimar\u00e3es , Portugal . The population in 2011 was 5,723 , in an area of 2.69 km\u00b2 . Town status received 1940-06-19 . During the Roman Era there were some testimonies , like the Ara de Trajano , with inscriptions to the emperor . Several vestiges of that time were found in the place where the first bathhouse was installed , which later became what is now known as the Old Baths . The discovery of new water sources and the need to construct new facilities for the hot springs determined the location of what is now known as the New Baths . After a period of interregnum , the thermal baths resumed their operation in the 1980s and have since been developing technical improvements , with the aim of extending the services . In addition to the thermal baths , there is a camping complex , a complex of swimming pools and a natural park that margins the Ave River . The town has experienced great growth both in terms of the resident population and in terms of urban agglomeration . This growth is explained by the appearance of the cutlery industry and the proximity to two important cities - Braga and Guimar\u00e3es and the improvement of access to these cities . The uncontrolled growth led to situations of rupture and the road connection to Guimar\u00e3es is made with some difficulty , due to the high traffic that is registered along that route .",
