  "/wiki/Aniakchak_National_Monument_and_Preserve": "Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve is a U.S. National Monument and National Preserve , consisting of the region around the Aniakchak volcano on the Aleutian Range of south-western Alaska . The 601,294-acre ( 243,335 ha ) monument is one of the least-visited places in the National Park System due to its remote location and difficult weather . The area was proclaimed a National Monument on December 1 , 1978 , and established as a National Monument and Preserve on December 2 , 1980 . The National Monument encompasses 137,176 acres ( 55,513 ha ) and the preserve 464,118 acres ( 187,822 ha ) . Visitation to Aniakchak is the lowest of all areas of the U.S. National Park System , according to the NPS , with only 100 documented recreational visits in 2017 . Most visitors fly into Surprise Lake inside Aniakchak Crater , but the frequent fog and other adverse weather conditions make landing in the lake difficult . It is also possible to fly into the nearby village of Port Heiden and proceed overland to the Aniakchak Crater . The core of the national monument lands encompasses the 6-mile ( 9.7 km ) wide Aniakchak Crater . The high point on the caldera rim is Aniakchak Peak . The lake within the caldera , Surprise Lake , is the source of the Aniakchak River . Multiple streams and rivers within the caldera flow into Surprise Lake to form it . In addition to Surprise Lake , the other prominent feature inside the caldera is Vent Mountain , the site of the most recent ( 1931 ) eruption within the caldera .",

  "/wiki/Caldera": "A caldera is a large cauldron-like hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber/reservoir in a volcanic eruption . When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time , structural support for the rock above the magma chamber is lost . The ground surface then collapses downward into the emptied or partially emptied magma chamber , leaving a massive depression at the surface ( from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter ) . Although sometimes described as a crater , the feature is actually a type of sinkhole , as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact . Only seven caldera-forming collapses are known to have occurred since 1900 , most recently at B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga volcano , Iceland in 2014 .",

They are located at latitude 67 degrees 24 ' N and longitude 154 degrees 10 ' W. All of the summits of the peaks are around 6,000 ft , 1825 m elevation . The Arrigetch Peaks area was designated as a National Natural Landmark in 1968 for its spectacular geography . The earliest recorded visit was in 1911 by Philip Smith , a geologist . The renowned conservationist Robert Marshall traveled through the area in the 1930s . These trips were described in his 1933 book Arctic Village , and posthumous Alaska Wilderness : Exploring the Central Brooks Range . An American climbing party led by Brownell Bergen completed the first successful rock climbing expedition to the peaks in 1964 . The peaks have been visited by a number of rock climbing expeditions since then .",

  "/wiki/Metamorphic": "Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types , in a process called metamorphism , which means change in form . The original rock ( protolith ) is subjected to heat ( temperatures greater than 150 to 200 \u00b0C ) and pressure ( 100 megapascals ( 1,000 bar ) or more ) , causing profound physical or chemical change . The protolith may be a sedimentary , igneous , or existing metamorphic rock . Metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the Earth 's crust and form 12% of the Earth 's land surface . They are classified by texture and by chemical and mineral assemblage ( metamorphic facies ) . They may be formed simply by being deep beneath the Earth 's surface , subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure of the rock layers above it . They can form from tectonic processes such as continental collisions , which cause horizontal pressure , friction and distortion . They are also formed when rock is heated by the intrusion of hot molten rock called magma from the Earth 's interior . The study of metamorphic rocks ( now exposed at the Earth 's surface following erosion and uplift ) provides information about the temperatures and pressures that occur at great depths within the Earth 's crust . Some examples of metamorphic rocks are gneiss , slate , marble , schist , and quartzite .",
  "/wiki/Granitic": "A granitoid or granitic rock is a variety of coarse grained plutonic rock - granite or similar - which mineralogically is composed predominantly of feldspar and quartz mica . Examples of granitoid rocks include granite , quartz monzonite , quartz diorite , syenite , granodiorite , tonalite and trondhjemite . Many are created by continental volcanic arc subduction or the collision of sialic masses . Volcanic rocks are common with granitoids and typically have the same origins . However , they are normally worn away after years of erosion . Many granitoid rocks are located in areas that have experienced crustal thickening during orogenies but others , known as anorogenic granitoids , are unrelated to convergent boundaries or subduction zones . These anorogenic granitoids may represent the deep sources for rift volcanism exposed where erosion has removed the volcanic rocks and other evidence of rifting . These A-type granitoids may have been produced by hotspots or mantle plumes .",

  "/wiki/Tide_flat": "Mudflats or mud flats , also known as tidal flats , are coastal wetlands that form in intertidal areas where sediments have been deposited by tides or rivers . A recent global analysis suggested they are as extensive globally as mangroves . They are found in sheltered areas such as bays , bayous , lagoons , and estuaries . Mudflats may be viewed geologically as exposed layers of bay mud , resulting from deposition of estuarine silts , clays and marine animal detritus . Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the intertidal zone , and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily . In the past tidal flats were considered unhealthy , economically unimportant areas and were often dredged and developed into agricultural land . Several especially shallow mudflat areas , such as the Wadden Sea , are now popular among those practising the sport of mudflat hiking . On the Baltic Sea coast of Germany in places , mudflats are exposed not by tidal action , but by wind-action driving water away from the shallows into the sea . These wind-affected mudflats are called windwatts in German .",

  "/wiki/Stratovolcano": "A stratovolcano , also known as a composite volcano , is a conical volcano built up by many layers ( strata ) of hardened lava , tephra , pumice and ash . Unlike shield volcanoes , stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions , although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas . The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far , due to high viscosity . The magma forming this lava is often felsic , having high-to-intermediate levels of silica ( as in rhyolite , dacite , or andesite ) , with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma . Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon , but have travelled as far as 15 km ( 9.3 mi ) . Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called composite volcanoes because of their composite stratified structure built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials . They are among the most common types of volcanoes , in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes . Two famous examples of stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa in Indonesia , known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 , and Vesuvius in Italy , whose catastrophic eruption in AD 79 ruined the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum . Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives . In modern times , Mount Saint Helens and Mount Pinatubo have erupted catastrophically , with fewer deaths . The possible existence of stratovolcanoes on other terrestrial bodies of the Solar System has not been conclusively demonstrated . The one feasible exception is the existence of some isolated massifs on Mars , for example the Zephyria Tholus .",

It is named in honor of Alessandro Malaspina , a Tuscan explorer in the service of the Spanish Navy , who visited the region in 1791 . In 1874 , W.H . Dall , of what is now the U.S. National Geodetic Survey , bestowed the name Malaspina Plateau on it , not realizing its true geological character . It arises where several valley glaciers , primarily the Seward Glacier and Agassiz Glacier , spill out from the Saint Elias Mountains onto the coastal plain facing the Gulf of Alaska between Icy Bay and Yakutat Bay . Although it fills the plain , nowhere does it actually reach the water and so does not qualify as a tidewater glacier . The Malaspina is up to 600 meters ( 2,000 ft ) thick in places , with the elevation of its bottom being estimated to be as much as 300 m ( 980 ft ) below sea level . There are two lakes on its margins : Oily Lake to the northwest , at the foot of the Samovar Hills between the Agassiz and Seward glaciers , and Malaspina Lake to the southeast , close to Yakutat Bay . Radar data and aerial photographs dating back to 1972 provide evidence that the Malaspina-Seward glacier system lost about 20 m ( 66 ft ) of its thickness between 1980 and 2000 ; because the glacier is so large , that amount of shrinkage was sufficient to contribute 1/2 of one percent of the rise in the global sea level . Nearly all of the glacier is encompassed by the southeast lobe of the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve . In October 1969 , the glacier became a National Natural Landmark .",

  "/wiki/Polar_ice_cap": "A polar ice cap or polar cap is a high-latitude region of a planet , dwarf planet , or natural satellite that is covered in ice . There are no requirements with respect to size or composition for a body of ice to be termed a polar ice cap , nor any geological requirement for it to be over land ; only that it must be a body of solid phase matter in the polar region . This causes the term polar ice cap to be something of a misnomer , as the term ice cap itself is applied more narrowly to bodies that are over land , and cover less than 50,000 km2 : larger bodies are referred to as ice sheets . The composition of the ice will vary . For example , Earth 's polar caps are mainly water ice , whereas Mars 's polar ice caps are a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and water ice . Polar ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy in the form of solar radiation from the Sun than equatorial regions , resulting in lower surface temperatures . Earth 's polar caps have changed dramatically over the last 12,000 years . Seasonal variations of the ice caps takes place due to varied solar energy absorption as the planet or moon revolves around the Sun . Additionally , in geologic time scales , the ice caps may grow or shrink due to climate variation .",

He is a saint of the Orthodox Church , known as Saint Innocent for the monastic name he used in later life . The volcano was the site of a colossal ( VEI 6 ) eruption around 1750 BCE . This eruption left a large caldera . In modern times the volcano has had numerous small eruptions ( over ten of them since 1930 ) , all at a cinder cone in the middle of the caldera . Veniaminof is one of the highest of Alaskan volcanoes . Partly for this reason , it is covered by a glacier that fills most of the caldera . Because of the glacier and the caldera walls , there is the possibility of a major flood from a future glacier run . The volcano recently began erupting on September 3 , 2018 as magma broke through the summit and flowed down its slopes as a lava flow . Despite starting off as an effusive eruption , by November 20 , the eruption became more intense and ash was reaching 20,000 feet , prompting the AVO to give a warning for aviation because of the ash posing a threat to aviation .",

  "/wiki/Redoubt_Volcano": "Redoubt Volcano , or Mount Redoubt ( Russian : \u0420\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0443\u0442 ) , is an active stratovolcano in the largely volcanic Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska . Located at the head of the Chigmit Mountains subrange in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve , the mountain is just west of Cook Inlet , in the Kenai Peninsula Borough about 110 miles ( 180 km ) southwest of Anchorage . At 10,197 feet ( 3,108 m ) , in just over 5 miles ( 8 km ) Mount Redoubt attains 9,150 feet ( 2,700 m ) of prominence over its surrounding terrain . It is the highest summit in the Aleutian Range . In 1976 , Redoubt Volcano was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service . Active for millennia , Mount Redoubt has erupted four times since it was first observed : in 1902 , 1966 , 1989 and 2009 , with two questionable eruptions in 1881 and 1933 . The eruption in 1989 spewed volcanic ash to a height of 45,000 ft ( 14,000 m ) . It caught KLM Flight 867 , a Boeing 747 aircraft , in its plume . After the plane descended 13,000 feet , the pilots restarted the engines and landed the plane safely at Anchorage . The ash blanketed an area of about 7,700 sq mi ( 20,000 km2 ) . The 1989 eruption is also notable for being the first ever volcanic eruption to be successfully predicted by the method of long-period seismic events developed by Swiss/American volcanologist Bernard Chouet . As of August 2015 , the Alaska Volcano Observatory has rated Redoubt as Aviation Alert Level Green and Volcano Alert Level Normal .",

Most of the Aleutian Islands belong to the U.S. state of Alaska , but some belong to the Russian federal subject of Kamchatka Krai . They form part of the Aleutian Arc in the Northern Pacific Ocean , occupying an area of 6,821 sq mi ( 17,666 km2 ) and extending about 1,200 mi ( 1,900 km ) westward from the Alaska Peninsula toward the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia , and mark a dividing line between the Bering Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south . Crossing longitude 180\u00b0 , at which point east and west longitude end , the archipelago contains both the westernmost part of the United States by longitude ( Amatignak Island ) and the easternmost by longitude ( Semisopochnoi Island ) . The westernmost U.S. island in real terms , however , is Attu Island , west of which runs the International Date Line . While nearly all the archipelago is part of Alaska and is usually considered as being in the Alaskan Bush , at the extreme western end , the small , geologically related Commander Islands belong to Russia . The islands , with their 57 volcanoes , form the northernmost part of the Pacific Ring of Fire . Physiographically , they are a distinct section of the larger Pacific Border province , which in turn is part of the larger Pacific Mountain System physiographic division . Battles and skirmishes occurred on the islands during the Aleutian Islands Campaign of World War II . The Japanese landings and occupations of Kiska and Attu in June 1942 were the only two invasions of the United States during that war .",

  "/wiki/Hauling-out": "Hauling-out is a behaviour associated with pinnipeds ( true seals , sea lions , fur seals and walruses ) temporarily leaving the water . Hauling-out typically occurs between periods of foraging activity . Rather than remain in the water , pinnipeds haul-out onto land or sea-ice for reasons such as reproduction and rest . Hauling-out is necessary in seals for mating ( with the exception of the Baikal seal ) and giving birth ( although a distinction is generally made between reproductive aggregations , termed rookeries , and non-reproductive aggregations , termed haul-outs ) . Other benefits of hauling-out may include predator avoidance , thermoregulation , social activity , parasite reduction and rest . There is much variation in haul-out patterns among different seal species . Haul-out sites may be segregated by age and sex within the same species . Many species of pinniped have only a few localized rookeries where they breed , but periodically occupy hundreds of haul-out sites throughout the range . For example , the Australian fur seals breed on only nine islands in Bass Strait but also occupy up to 50 haul-out sites in south-east Australian waters , and Steller sea lions have around 50 rookeries throughout their range , but several hundred haul-out sites . Hauling-out behaviour provides numerous benefits to pinnipeds besides reproduction . This behaviour has been shown to be used for activities such as thermoregulation , predator avoidance , moulting , nursing , and resting . Haul-out frequency , duration , and site location ( ie .",

The walrus is the only living species in the family Odobenidae and genus Odobenus . This species is subdivided into two subspecies : the Atlantic walrus ( O. r. rosmarus ) which lives in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific walrus ( O. r. divergens ) which lives in the Pacific Ocean . Adult walrus are characterised by prominent tusks and whiskers , and their considerable bulk : adult males in the Pacific can weigh more than 2,000 kg ( 4,400 lb ) and , among pinnipeds , are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals . Walruses live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves , spending significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat . Walruses are relatively long-lived , social animals , and they are considered to be a keystone species in the Arctic marine regions . The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples , who have hunted the walrus for its meat , fat , skin , tusks , and bone . During the 19th century and the early 20th century , walruses were widely hunted and killed for their blubber , walrus ivory , and meat . The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region . Their population has rebounded somewhat since then , though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference .",
