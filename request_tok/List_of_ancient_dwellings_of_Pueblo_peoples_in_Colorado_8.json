  "/wiki/Mesa_Verde_National_Park": "Mesa Verde National Park is an American national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Montezuma County , Colorado . The park protects some of the best-preserved Ancestral Puebloan archaeological sites in the United States . Established by Congress and President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 , the park occupies 52,485 acres ( 21,240 ha ) near the Four Corners region of the American Southwest . With more than 5,000 sites , including 600 cliff dwellings , it is the largest archaeological preserve in the United States . Mesa Verde ( Spanish for green table ) is best known for structures such as Cliff Palace , thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America . Starting c. 7500 BC Mesa Verde was seasonally inhabited by a group of nomadic Paleo-Indians known as the Foothills Mountain Complex . The variety of projectile points found in the region indicates they were influenced by surrounding areas , including the Great Basin , the San Juan Basin , and the Rio Grande Valley . Later , Archaic people established semi-permanent rock shelters in and around the mesa . By 1000 BC , the Basketmaker culture emerged from the local Archaic population , and by 750 AD the Ancestral Puebloans had developed from the Basketmaker culture . The Mesa Verdeans survived using a combination of hunting , gathering , and subsistence farming of crops such as corn , beans , and squash . They built the mesa 's first pueblos sometime after 650 , and by the end of the 12th century , they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known . By 1285 , following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts , they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico , including Rio Chama , Pajarito Plateau , and Santa Fe .",

  "/wiki/Kiva": "A kiva is a room used by Puebloans for rites and political meetings , many of them associated with the kachina belief system . Among the modern Hopi and most other Pueblo people , kivas are square-walled and underground , and are used for spiritual ceremonies . Similar subterranean rooms are found among ruins in the North-American South-West , indicating uses by the ancient peoples of the region including the ancestral Puebloans , the Mogollon , and the Hohokam . Those used by the ancient Pueblos of the Pueblo I Period and following , designated by the Pecos Classification system developed by archaeologists , were usually round and evolved from simpler pit-houses . For the Ancestral Puebloans , these rooms are believed to have had a variety of functions , including domestic residence along with social and ceremonial purposes .",
