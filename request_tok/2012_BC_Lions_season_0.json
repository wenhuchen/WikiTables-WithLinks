  "/wiki/Montreal_Alouettes": "The Montreal Alouettes ( French : Les Alouettes de Montr\u00e9al ) are a professional Canadian football team based in Montreal , Quebec . Founded in 1946 , the team has folded and been revived twice . The Alouettes compete in the East Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) and last won the Grey Cup championship in 2010 . Their home field is Percival Molson Memorial Stadium for the regular season and as of 2014 also home of their playoff games . The original Alouettes team ( 1946-1981 ) won four Grey Cups and were particularly dominant in the 1970s . After their collapse in 1982 , they were immediately reconstituted under new ownership as the Montreal Concordes . After playing for four years as the Concordes , they revived the Alouettes name for the 1986 season . A second folding in 1987 led to a nine-year hiatus of CFL football in the city . The current Alouettes franchise was established in 1996 by the owners of the Baltimore Stallions . The Stallions were disbanded at the same time as the Alouettes ' re-establishment after having been the most successful of the CFL 's American expansion franchises , culminating in a Grey Cup championship in 1995 . Many players from the Stallions ' 1995 roster signed with the Alouettes and formed the core of the team 's 1996 roster . For record-keeping purposes , the CFL considers all clubs that have played in Montreal as one franchise dating to 1946 , and considers the Alouettes to have suspended operations in 1987 before returning in 1996 .",

The team 's origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged in North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century . The Argonauts played their home games at Rogers Centre ( originally known as SkyDome ) from 1989 until 2016 when the team moved to BMO Field , the fifth stadium site to host the team . The Argonauts have won the Grey Cup a record 17 times and have appeared in the final 23 times . Most recently they defeated the Calgary Stampeders 27-24 in the 105th Grey Cup in 2017 .

The team was founded and owned by the Argonaut Rowing Club for its first 83 years , and has been owned by a series of business interests since 1956 . The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for decades , with attendance peaking in the 1970s . In May 2015 it was announced that a consortium of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment 's Larry Tanenbaum ( via the Kilmer Group ) and Bell Canada would acquire the team . The sale included a scheduled move to MLSE run BMO Field for the 2016 season , which has long been proposed given attendance under-utilization at Rogers Centre and announced plans to install natural grass at the domed stadium , rendering it unfit for football .",
