The Commissioners are proposed by the Council of the European Union , on the basis of suggestions made by the national governments , and then appointed by the European Council after the approval of the European Parliament . It is common , although not a formal requirement , that the commissioners have previously held senior political positions , such as being a member of the European Parliament or a government minister . This EU institution operates as a cabinet government , with 27 members of the Commission ( informally known as commissioners ) . There is one member per member state , but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state . One of the 27 is the Commission President ( currently Ursula von der Leyen ) proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament . The Council of the European Union then nominates the other members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President , and the 27 members as a single body are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament . The current Commission is the Von der Leyen Commission , which took office in December 2019 , following the European Parliament elections in May of the same year . The term Commission is variously used , either in the narrow sense of the 27-member College of Commissioners ( or College ) or to also include the administrative body of about 32,000 European civil servants who are split into departments called directorates-general and services .

An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .
