Ch\u00e1vez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007 , when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) , which he led until 2012 . Born into a middle class family in Sabaneta , Barinas , Ch\u00e1vez became a career military officer and , after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact , founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 ( MBR-200 ) in the early 1980s .

Following the adoption of a new constitution in 1999 , Ch\u00e1vez focused on enacting social reforms as part of the Bolivarian Revolution . Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s , his government nationalized key industries , created participatory democratic Communal Councils and implemented social programs known as the Bolivarian missions to expand access to food , housing , healthcare and education . The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez ' presidency resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty , literacy , income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007 , with a reversal beginning after around 2012 ; beyond falling oil prices , there are arguments that government policies did not address structural inequalities . On 2 June 2010 , Ch\u00e1vez declared an economic war on Venezuela 's upper classes due to shortages , arguably beginning the crisis in Venezuela .",

It was drafted in mid-1999 by a constituent assembly that had been created by popular referendum . Adopted in December 1999 , it replaced the 1961 Constitution , the longest-serving in Venezuelan history . It was primarily promoted by then President of Venezuela Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and thereafter received strong backing from diverse sectors , including figures involved in promulgating the 1961 constitution such as Luis Miquilena and Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez . Ch\u00e1vez and his followers ( chavistas ) refer to the 1999 document as the Constituci\u00f3n Bolivariana ( the Bolivarian Constitution ) because they assert that it is ideologically descended from the thinking and political philosophy of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and Bolivarianism . Since the creation of the Constituent National Assembly in August 2017 , the Bolivarian government has declared the 1999 constitution suspended until a new constitution is created . The Constitution of 1999 was the first constitution approved by popular referendum in Venezuelan history , and summarily inaugurated the so-called Fifth Republic of Venezuela due to the socioeconomic changes foretold in its pages , as well as the official change in Venezuela 's name from the Rep\u00fablica de Venezuela ( Republic of Venezuela ) to the Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela ( Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ) . Major changes are made to the structure of Venezuela 's government and responsibilities , while a much greater number of human rights are enshrined in the document as guaranteed to all Venezuelans - including free education up to tertiary level , free health care , access to a clean environment , right of minorities ( especially indigenous peoples ) to uphold their own traditional cultures , religions , and languages , among others . The 1999 Constitution , with 350 articles , is among the world 's longest , most complicated , and most comprehensive constitutions . One of the outstanding differences between Venezuelan and most of the other constitutions of the Americas is the lack of the possibility of impeachment of the president by the national parliament . Instead , it enables citizens to remove the president through a recall referendum .",

Born in Chekiang ( Zhejiang ) Province , Chiang was a member of the Kuomintang and a lieutenant of Sun Yat-sen in the revolution to overthrow the Beiyang government and reunify China . With Soviet and communist ( CPC ) help , Chiang organized the military for Sun 's Canton Nationalist Government and headed the Whampoa Military Academy . Commander in chief of the National Revolutionary Army ( from which he came to be known as Generalissimo ) , he led the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1928 , before defeating a coalition of warlords and nominally reunifying China under a new Nationalist government . Midway through the campaign , the KMT-CPC alliance broke down and Chiang purged the communists inside the party , triggering a civil war with the CCP , which he eventually lost in 1949 . As leader of the Republic of China in the Nanjing decade , Chiang sought to strike a difficult balance between the modernizing China while also devoting resources to defending the nation against the impending Japanese threat . Trying to avoid a war with Japan while hostilities with CCP continued , he was kidnapped in the Xi'an Incident and obliged to form an Anti-Japanese United Front with the CCP . Following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 , he mobilized China for the Second Sino-Japanese War . For eight years he led the war of resistance against a vastly superior enemy , mostly from the wartime capital Chongqing . As the leader of a major Allied power , Chiang met with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Cairo Conference to discuss terms for Japanese surrender . No sooner had the Second World War ended than the Civil War with the communists , by then led by Mao Zedong , resumed .

Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921 . Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939 , when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland , and were finalized after World War II . During WWII , military operations devastated Belarus , which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources . The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years .

With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

Before his presidency , he was the chairman of the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction from 1961 to 1963 after a career as a military leader in the South Korean army . Park 's coup brought an end to the interim government of the Second Republic and his election and inauguration in 1963 ushered in the Third Republic . Seeking to bring South Korea into the developed world , Park began a series of economic policies that brought rapid economic growth and industrialization to the nation that eventually became known as the Miracle on the Han River . South Korea became one of the fastest growing nations during the 60s and 70s as a result . Although popular during the 60s , by the 1970s , as growth began to slow , Park 's popularity started to wane , resulting in a close victory during the 1971 South Korean presidential election . Following this , in 1972 , Park declared martial law and amended the constitution into a highly authoritarian document called the Yushin Constitution . Formally , the pretense was that the Yushin Constitution was the seventh Constitutional amendment . In actuality , its effect was tantamount to abolition of the former Constitution - effectively creating a new one in an effort to legitimize the new Fourth Republic [ citation needed ] . During this time , political opposition and dissent was constantly repressed and Park had complete control of the media and military . Park survived several previous attempts to kill him , including two operations associated with North Korea [ citation needed ] . Following the student uprising later known as the Bu-Ma Democratic Protests , Park was assassinated on 26 October 1979 by his close friend Kim Jae-gyu , the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency , at a safe house in Seoul .",

Among the powers appropriated to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons , veto legislation , and call the legislature into session . The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state 's military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state . The officeholder is given broad statutory authority to make appointments to the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch , limited somewhat by the adoption of a merit system for state employees in 1960 .

For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire .

After his death , the army split into various factions competing for power , in a period called the Warlord Era . Although the government and the state were nominally under civilian control under a constitution , the Beiyang generals were effectively in charge of it . Nevertheless , the government enjoyed legitimacy abroad along with diplomatic recognition , had access to tax and customs revenue , and could apply for foreign financial loans . Its legitimacy was seriously challenged in 1917 , by Sun Yat-sen 's Guangzhou-based Kuomintang ( KMT ) government movement . His successor Chiang Kai-shek defeated the Beiyang warlords during the Northern Expedition between 1926 and 1928 , and overthrew the factions and the government , effectively unifying the country in 1928 . The Kuomintang proceeded to install its nationalist government in Nanking ; China 's political order became a one-party state , and subsequently received international recognition as the legitimate government of China ."
