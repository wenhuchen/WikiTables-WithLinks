  "/wiki/Bank_of_Sweden_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences_in_Memory_of_Alfred_Nobel": "The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences , commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics , is an award for outstanding contributions to the field of economics , and generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field . The award 's official name is The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ( Swedish : Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne ) . The prize was established in 1968 by a donation from Sweden 's central bank Sveriges Riksbank to the Nobel Foundation to commemorate the bank 's 300th anniversary . As it is not one of the prizes that Alfred Nobel established in his will in 1895 , it is not technically a Nobel Prize . However , it is administered and referred to along with the Nobel Prizes by the Nobel Foundation . Laureates are announced with the Nobel Prize laureates , and receive the award at the same ceremony . Laureates in the Memorial Prize in Economics are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . It was first awarded in 1969 to Dutch and Norwegian economists Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch , for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes .",
  "/wiki/Saul_Bellow": "Saul Bellow ( born Solomon Bellows ; 10 June 1915 - 5 April 2005 ) was a Canadian-American writer . For his literary work , Bellow was awarded the Pulitzer Prize , the Nobel Prize for Literature , and the National Medal of Arts . He is the only writer to win the National Book Award for Fiction three times and he received the National Book Foundation 's lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1990 . In the words of the Swedish Nobel Committee , his writing exhibited the mixture of rich picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture , of entertaining adventure , drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation , all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act , or prevent us from acting , and that can be called the dilemma of our age . His best-known works include The Adventures of Augie March , Henderson the Rain King , Herzog , Mr. Sammler 's Planet , Seize the Day , Humboldt 's Gift and Ravelstein . Bellow was widely regarded as one of the 20th century 's greatest authors . Bellow said that of all his characters , Eugene Henderson , of Henderson the Rain King , was the one most like himself . Bellow grew up as an immigrant from Quebec . As Christopher Hitchens describes it , Bellow 's fiction and principal characters reflect his own yearning for transcendence , a battle to overcome not just ghetto conditions but also ghetto psychoses . Bellow 's protagonists , in one shape or another , all wrestle with what Albert Corde , the dean in The Dean 's December , called the big-scale insanities of the 20th century . This transcendence of the unutterably dismal ( a phrase from Dangling Man ) is achieved , if it can be achieved at all , through a ferocious assimilation of learning ( Hitchens ) and an emphasis on nobility .",

His demonstration of the golden rule savings rate , a concept related to work by John von Neumann , started a wave of research on how much a nation should spend on present consumption rather than save and invest for future generations . Phelps was at the University of Pennsylvania from 1966 to 1971 and moved to Columbia University in 1971 . His most seminal work inserted a microfoundation , one featuring imperfect information , incomplete knowledge and expectations about wages and prices , to support a macroeconomic theory of employment determination and price-wage dynamics . That led to his development of the natural rate of unemployment : its existence and the mechanism governing its size . In the early 2000s , he turned to the study of business innovation .
