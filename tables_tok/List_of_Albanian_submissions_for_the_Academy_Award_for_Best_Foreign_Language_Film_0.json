  "intro": "Albania has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] on an irregular basis since 1996. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since. The Albanian submission is decided by a committee appointed by the Albanian Ministry of Culture. Twelve Albanian films have been submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but none of them has yet been nominated for an Oscar."
