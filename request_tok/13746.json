A former resident of Fort Wayne , Indiana and longtime resident of the Florida Keys , Brandt committed suicide in September 2004 after he stabbed his wife , Teresa Teri Brandt , and decapitated and severely mutilated his niece , Michelle Jones , removing her heart . An investigation by the police concluded that Brandt hung himself in Jones ' garage after committing the murders . Brandt had shot his parents , killing his pregnant mother , in 1971 when he was 13 . His father survived . He spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released , and was never criminally charged . This incident , Brandt 's efficiency in killing his wife and niece , and his hidden obsession with human anatomy led investigators to look into the possibility that he had committed other murders since moving to Florida in 1973 . The police have linked at least two homicides to Brandt .",

The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia , which can be considered its legal predecessor state . Italy declared war on Austria in alliance with Prussia in 1866 and received the region of Veneto following their victory . Italian troops entered Rome in 1870 , thereby ending more than one thousand years of Papal temporal power . Italy entered into a Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882 , following strong disagreements with France about the respective colonial expansions . However , even if relations with Berlin became very friendly , the alliance with Vienna remained purely formal as the Italians were keen to acquire Trentino and Trieste , corners of Austria-Hungary populated by Italians . So during World War I , Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allied Powers , as the western powers promised territorial compensation ( at the expense of Austria-Hungary ) for participation that was more generous than Vienna 's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality . Victory in the war gave Italy a permanent seat in the Council of the League of Nations . Fascist Italy is the era of National Fascist Party government from 1922 to 1943 with Benito Mussolini as head of government . The fascists imposed totalitarian rule and crushed the political and intellectual opposition , while promoting economic modernization , traditional social values and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church . According to Payne ( 1996 ) , [ the ] Fascist government passed through several relatively distinct phases . The first phase ( 1923-1925 ) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system , albeit with a legally-organized executive dictatorship .",

Between 1978 and 1995 , he killed three people and injured 23 others in an attempt to start a revolution by conducting a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology . In 1971 , Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln , Montana , where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient . He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable ; he began his bombing campaign in 1978 . In 1995 , he sent a letter to The New York Times and promised to desist from terrorism if The Times or The Washington Post published his essay Industrial Society and Its Future , in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large-scale organization . Kaczynski was the subject of the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .

  "/wiki/Hitman": "Contract killing is a form of murder in which one party hires another party ( often called a hitman ) to kill a target individual or group of people . It involves an illegal agreement between two or more parties in which one party agrees to kill the target in exchange for some form of payment , monetary or otherwise . Either party may be a person , group , or an organization . Contract killing has been associated with organized crime , government conspiracies , and vendettas . For example , in the United States , the gang Murder , Inc. committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during the 1930s and 1940s . Contract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to carry out the actual killing , making it more difficult for law enforcement to connect said party with the murder . The likelihood that authorities will establish that party 's guilt for the committed crime , especially due to lack of forensic evidence linked to the contracting party , makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party .",

  "/wiki/Mexico": "Mexico ( Spanish : M\u00e9xico [ \u02c8mexiko ] ( listen ) ; Nahuatl languages : M\u0113xihco ) , officially the United Mexican States ( UMS ; Spanish : Estados Unidos Mexicanos , EUM [ es\u02c8ta\u00f0os u\u02c8ni\u00f0oz mexi\u02c8kanos ] ( listen ) , lit . Mexican United States ) , is a country in the southern portion of North America . It is bordered to the north by the United States ; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean ; to the southeast by Guatemala , Belize , and the Caribbean Sea ; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico . Covering almost 2,000,000 square kilometers ( 770,000 sq mi ) , the nation is the fifth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent state in the world . With an estimated population of over 129 million people , Mexico is the tenth most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world , while being the second most populous nation in Latin America after Brazil . Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states plus Mexico City ( CDMX ) , which is the capital city and its most populous city . Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara , Monterrey , Puebla , Toluca , Tijuana , and Le\u00f3n . Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec , Toltec , Teotihuacan , Zapotec , Maya , and Aztec before first contact with Europeans . In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",

  "/wiki/Bernhard_Prigan": "Bernhard Prigan ( born 1920 ) was a German serial killer who killed at least three women between the end of the 1940s and the early 1950s . He always sought his victims in the immediate vicinity of controlled-access highways and major roads , and it is unknown how many of these so-called Highway murders he committed . He was described by the press as The Strangler , and The Highway Killer , On November 7 , 1952 , Prigan was arrested in a village near Mannheim . He confessed to three murders , including the murder of 49-year-old seamstress Wilma Sulzer from Altlu\u00dfheim five days earlier . A bread crust found at the crime scene near the main road to Mannheim contributed to his arrest . Based on this , authorities tracked down the bread factory 's location . There , a trader described seeing a man with a headband . A patrolman , whom Prigan had asked for directions , later recalled talking to him . On the day of his arrest , he had killed 51-year-old housewife Margarethe Pohl in the forest with a club . He was observed by a student , who fled out of fear . Prigan caught up to him , asking him about a pump and advising not to go to the woods any more , as there were drunk guys . On December 19 , 1953 , Prigan was sentenced to three times life imprisonment after four days of trial .",
  "/wiki/Allied-occupied_Germany": "Upon defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II , the victorious Allies asserted joint authority and sovereignty over 'Germany as a whole ' , defined as all territories of the former German Reich west of the Oder-Neisse line , having declared the destruction of Nazi Germany at the death of Adolf Hitler ( see 1945 Berlin Declaration ) . The four powers divided 'Germany as a whole ' into four occupation zones for administrative purposes , under the United States , United Kingdom , France and the Soviet Union respectively ; creating what became collectively known as Allied-occupied Germany ( German : Alliierten-besetztes Deutschland ) . This division was ratified at the Potsdam Conference ( 17 July to 2 August 1945 ) . [ not verified in body ] The four zones were as agreed in February 1945 by the United States , United Kingdom and Soviet Union meeting at the Yalta Conference ; setting aside an earlier division into three zones ( excluding France ) proposed by the London Protocol . At Potsdam , the United States , United Kingdom and the Soviet Union approved the detachment from 'Germany as a whole ' of the German eastern territories east of the Oder-Neisse line ; with the exact line of the boundary to be determined at a final German Peace Treaty . This treaty was expected to confirm the shifting westward of Poland 's borders , as the United Kingdom and the United States committed themselves to support in any future peace treaty the permanent incorporation of former eastern German territories into Poland and the Soviet Union . From March 1945 to July 1945 , these former eastern territories of Germany had been administered under Soviet military occupation authorities , but following the Potsdam Conference they were handed over to Soviet and Polish civilian administrations and ceased to constitute part of Allied-occupied Germany . In the closing weeks of fighting in Europe , United States forces had pushed beyond the agreed boundaries for the future zones of occupation , in some places by as much as 320 km ( 200 miles ) . The so-called line of contact between Soviet and American forces at the end of hostilities , mostly lying eastward of the July 1945-established inner German border , was temporary . After two months in which they had held areas that had been assigned to the Soviet zone , U.S. forces withdrew in the first days of July 1945 . Some have concluded that this was a crucial move that persuaded the Soviet Union to allow American , British and French forces into their designated sectors in Berlin , which occurred at roughly the same time ( July 1945 ) , although the need for intelligence gathering ( see Operation Paperclip ) may also have been a factor .",
  "/wiki/West_Germany": "West Germany was the informal name for the Federal Republic of Germany , a country in Western Europe , in the period between its formation on 23 May 1949 and German reunification on 3 October 1990 . During this Cold War period , the western portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc . The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate . Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1952 , and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 .",
