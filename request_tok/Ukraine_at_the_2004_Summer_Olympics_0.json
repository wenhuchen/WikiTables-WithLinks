The first round had split a full roster of runners into five heats with the first two gaining a direct qualification and then the next six fastest across all heats advancing to the semifinals . The top four runners in both of the semifinal heats moved on directly to the final . The final was expected to witness four early-season favorites , U.S. top runner Sheena Johnson , 1999 world champion Jana Pittman , current world record holder Yuliya Pechenkina , and two-time European champion Ionela T\u00e2rlea-Manolache , challenging each other for the Olympic title . Inside the stadium , however , the raucous Greek crowd turned their attention on home favorite Fan\u00ed Halki\u00e1 , who had previously lowered the Olympic record by 0.05 of a second in the second semifinal . All three medalists came from that semi , fifth place equalling 3rd place in the first semi . From the start in lane four , Halkia drew level with Pittman outside her at the halfway turn , until she quickly pulled away from the field on the last hundred metres and cleared the final hurdle . With none of the pre-race favorites willing to chase her on the home stretch , Halkia raced comfortably to an Olympic gold . Behind her , T\u00e2rlea-Manolache and Ukraine 's Tetyana Tereshchuk-Antipova came through on the inside to take the silver and bronze medals respectively . Running bravely against a tore knee injury , Pittman managed to finish the race in fifth place , while Pechenkina stumbled behind on a wretched run to round out the field in last . Halkia 's triumph proved to be a redemption for the host nation Greece in track and field , after the anti-doping scandal and suspicious affair on 2000 Olympic medalists and sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Ekaterini Thanou that tainted the start of the Games .",
