Situated in southernmost Jordan , Aqaba is the administrative centre of the Aqaba Governorate . The city had a population of 148,398 in 2015 and a land area of 375 square kilometres ( 144.8 sq mi ) . Today , Aqaba plays a major role in the development of the Jordanian economy , through the vibrant trade and tourism sectors . The Port of Aqaba also serves other countries in the region . Aqaba 's strategic location at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea between the continents of Asia and Africa , has made its port important over the course of thousands of years . The ancient city was called Elath , adopted in Latin as Aela and in Arabic as Ayla . Its strategic location and proximity to copper mines made it a regional hub for copper production and trade in the Chalcolithic period . Aela became a bishopric under Byzantine rule and later became a Latin Catholic titular see after Islamic conquest around AD 650 , when it became known as Ayla ; the name Aqaba is late medieval . The Great Arab Revolt 's Battle of Aqaba , depicted in the film Lawrence of Arabia , resulted in victory for Arab forces over the Ottoman defenders . Aqaba 's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has placed it in Jordan 's golden triangle of tourism , which strengthened the city 's location on the world map and made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan . The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority , which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax , duty-free city , attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis , Saraya Aqaba , Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba .",

In classical antiquity the city was known as Smyrna ( /\u02c8sm\u025c\u02d0rn\u0259/ SMUR-n\u0259 ) - a name which remained in use in English and various other languages until around 1930 , when government efforts led the original Greek name to be gradually phased out internationally in favor of its Turkish counterpart \u0130zmir . However , the historic name Smyrna is still used today in some languages , such as Greek ( \u03a3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7 , Sm\u00fdrni/Sm\u00fdrn\u0113 ) , Armenian ( \u0536\u0574\u0575\u0578\u0582\u057c\u0576\u056b\u0561 , Zmyurnia ) , Italian ( Smirne ) , and Catalan , Portuguese , and Spanish ( Esmirna ) .

With the population of 294,510 ( as of 2018 ) , it is the eleventh-largest city in Poland . The wider Katowice urban area has the population of approximately 2 to 3 million people . Throughout the mid-18th century , Katowice had developed into a village upon the discovery of rich coal reserves in the area . In 1742 the First Silesian War transferred Upper Silesia , including Katowice , to Prussia . Subsequently , from the second half of the 18th century , many German or Prussian craftsmen , merchants and artists began to settle in the region , which had been inhabited mostly by Poles over the past hundreds of years . Simultaneously Silesia experienced the influx of the first Jewish settlers . In the first half of the 19th century , intensive industrialization transformed local mills and farms into industrial steelworks , mines , foundries and artisan workshops . This also contributed to the establishment of companies and eventual rapid growth of the city . At the same time , Katowice became linked to the railway system with the first train arriving at the main station in 1847 . The outbreak of World War I was favourable for Katowice due to the prospering steel industry . Following Germany 's defeat and the Silesian Uprisings , Katowice and parts of Upper Silesia were annexed by the Second Polish Republic .",
