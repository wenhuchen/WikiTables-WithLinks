It lies on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea and is spread over a central peninsula and its surroundings . An intraregional transport hub and popular tourist destination , the city is linked to the Adriatic islands and the Apennine peninsula . Home to Diocletian 's Palace , built for the Roman emperor in AD 305 , the city was founded as the Greek colony of Asp\u00e1lathos ( A\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ) in the 3rd or 2nd century BC . It became a prominent settlement around 650 when it succeeded the ancient capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia , Salona . After the sack of Salona by the Avars and Slavs , the fortified Palace of Diocletian was settled by Roman refugees . Split became a Byzantine city . Later it drifted into the sphere of the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Croatia , with the Byzantines retaining nominal suzerainty . For much of the High and Late Middle Ages , Split enjoyed autonomy as a free city of the Dalmatian city-states , caught in the middle of a struggle between Venice and Croatia ( in union with Hungary ) for control over the Dalmatian cities . Venice eventually prevailed and during the early modern period Split remained a Venetian city , a heavily fortified outpost surrounded by Ottoman territory . Its hinterland was won from the Ottomans in the Morean War of 1699 , and in 1797 , as Venice fell to Napoleon , the Treaty of Campo Formio rendered the city to the Habsburg Monarchy .
