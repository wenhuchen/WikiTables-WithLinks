He had released four Korean albums , four Japanese albums , thirty Japanese singles and several Korean singles during his first six years in the music industry as TVXQ . In 2009 , Kim and fellow TVXQ members Kim Jaejoong and Park Yoochun filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment , arguing that their exclusive contracts were unilaterally disadvantageous towards the artists and should be invalidated . The Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of the three and granted an injunction suspending their contracts .

As JYJ , Kim has released one English album , two Korean albums , one Japanese EP , and one Korean EP .
