  "/wiki/Turbopump": "A turbopump is a propellant pump with two main components : a rotodynamic pump and a driving gas turbine , usually both mounted on the same shaft , or sometimes geared together . The purpose of a turbopump is to produce a high-pressure fluid for feeding a combustion chamber or other use . There are two types of turbopumps : a centrifugal pump , where the pumping is done by throwing fluid outward at high speed , or an axial-flow pump , where alternating rotating and static blades progressively raise the pressure of a fluid . Axial-flow pumps have small diameters but give relatively modest pressure increases . Although multiple compression stages are needed , axial flow pumps work well with low-density fluids . Centrifugal pumps are far more powerful for high-density fluids but require large diameters for low-density fluids . Turbopumps operate in much the same way as turbocharger units for vehicles : higher fuel pressures allow fuel to be supplied to higher-pressure combustion chambers for higher-performance engines .",

  "/wiki/Wind_turbines": "A wind turbine , or alternatively referred to as a wind energy converter , is a device that converts the wind 's kinetic energy into electrical energy . Wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis . The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs . Larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid . Arrays of large turbines , known as wind farms , are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels . One assessment claimed that , as of 2009 [ update ] , wind had the lowest relative greenhouse gas emissions , the least water consumption demands and . the most favourable social impacts compared to photovoltaic , hydro , geothermal , coal and gas .",
