European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho .

It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island , which it shares with the Republic of Haiti , making Hispaniola one of only two Caribbean islands , along with Saint Martin , that are shared by two sovereign states . The Dominican Republic is the second-largest nation in the Antilles by area ( after Cuba ) at 48,671 square kilometers ( 18,792 sq mi ) , and third by population with approximately 10.5 million people ( 2020 est . ) , of whom approximately 3.3 million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo , the capital city . The native Ta\u00edno people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of the Europeans , dividing it into five chiefdoms . The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years , and lived around the Caribbean islands . The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization . Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island , landing here on his first voyage in 1492 . The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas , the oldest continuously inhabited city , and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World . Meanwhile , France occupied the western third of Hispaniola , naming their colony Saint-Domingue , which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804 . After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821 . The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres , intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia , but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822 .",

The capital and largest city is Panama City , whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the country 's 4 million people . Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists arrived in the 16th century . It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia , a union of Nueva Granada , Ecuador , and Venezuela . After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831 , Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia . With the backing of the United States , Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 , allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914 . The 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties led to the transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama on December 31 , 1999 . Revenue from canal tolls continues to represent a significant portion of Panama 's GDP , although commerce , banking , and tourism are major and growing sectors . It is regarded as a high-income country . In 2018 Panama ranked 66th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index . In 2018 , Panama was ranked seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America , according to the World Economic Forum 's Global Competitiveness Index .

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",
