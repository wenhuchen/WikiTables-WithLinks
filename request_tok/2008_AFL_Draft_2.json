  "/wiki/Jack_Watts_(footballer)": "Jack Watts ( born 26 March 1991 ) is an Australian rules footballer playing for the Port Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League ( AFL ) . A utility , 1.96 metres ( 6 ft 5 in ) tall and weighing 93 kilograms ( 205 lb ) , Watts has the ability to play in any position on the ground and has played for extended periods of time as a forward , defender , wingman and back-up ruckman . He was a talented sportsman at a young age , playing both basketball and Australian rules football . In basketball , he represented Victoria and Australia , before giving up the sport to focus on football . He was recognised as a gifted footballer at a young age when he represented Victoria at the under-12 level . He went on to represent the state in the 2008 AFL Under 18 Championships as a bottom-aged player where he won the Larke Medal as the best player in the championships and was named as the full-forward in the All-Australian team . Watts ' performances in the championships saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 AFL draft at seventeen years of age , a year younger than most of his fellow draftees . The hype surrounding Watts in his first season was profound until he made his debut in the Queen 's Birthday clash against Collingwood in the 2009 season . The management of his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club because he was played despite being unready for senior football . Instead , Watts was used as a promotional tool to create a sense of hope for long-suffering fans . Criticism has followed Watts closely throughout his career due to the expectations that were placed on him being the number one draft pick and many believing he was not living up to his potential . Despite the criticism that has followed Watts , he has maintained a spot in the senior side throughout his career and has played over one hundred matches .",
