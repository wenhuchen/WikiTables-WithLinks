  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",
  "/wiki/Armenian_genocide": "The Armenian Genocide [ a ] ( also known as the Armenian Holocaust ) was the systematic mass murder and expulsion of 1.5 million ethnic Armenians [ note 2 ] within the Ottoman Empire ( most of whom were citizens ) by the Ottoman government from approximately 1914 to 1923 . The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915 , the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up , arrested , and deported from Constantinople ( now Istanbul ) to the region of Angora ( Ankara ) , 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders , the majority of whom were eventually murdered . The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases - the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly , and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian Desert . Driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and massacre . Most Armenian diaspora communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide . Other ethnic groups were similarly targeted for extermination in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide , and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy . Raphael Lemkin was moved specifically by the annihilation of the Armenians to define systematic and premeditated exterminations within legal parameters and to coin the word genocide in 1943 . The Armenian Genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides , because scholars point to the organized manner in which the killings were carried out . It is the second-most-studied case of genocide after the Holocaust . Turkey denies that the word genocide is an accurate term for these crimes , but in recent years has been faced with increasing calls to recognize them as such . As of 2019 [ update ] , governments and parliaments of 32 countries , including the United States , Russia , and Germany have recognized the events as a genocide .",

Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues , and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition . In many cases , tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held . The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema , when Georges Melies ' A Trip to the Moon ( 1902 ) employed trick photography effects . The next major example in the genre was the film Metropolis ( 1927 ) . From the 1930s to the 1950s , the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B movies . After Stanley Kubrick 's landmark 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) , the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously .

Combining literary acclaim with widespread popularity , Greene acquired a reputation early in his lifetime as a major writer , both of serious Catholic novels , and of thrillers ( or entertainments as he termed them ) . He was shortlisted , in 1966 and 1967 , for the Nobel Prize for Literature . Through 67 years of writings , which included over 25 novels , he explored the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world , often through a Catholic perspective . Although Greene objected strongly to being described as a Roman Catholic novelist , rather than as a novelist who happened to be Catholic , Catholic religious themes are at the root of much of his writing , especially the four major Catholic novels : Brighton Rock , The Power and the Glory , The Heart of the Matter , and The End of the Affair ; which have been named the gold standard of the Catholic novel . Several works , such as The Confidential Agent , The Quiet American , Our Man in Havana , The Human Factor , and his screenplay for The Third Man , also show Greene 's avid interest in the workings and intrigues of international politics and espionage . Greene was born in Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire into a large , influential family that included the owners of the Greene King Brewery . He boarded at Berkhamsted School in Hertfordshire , where his father taught and became headmaster . Unhappy at the school , he attempted suicide several times . He attended Balliol College , Oxford , to study history , where , while an undergraduate , he published his first work in 1925 - a poorly received volume of poetry , Babbling April . After graduating , Greene worked first as a private tutor and then as a journalist - first on the Nottingham Journal and then as a sub-editor on The Times .

  "/wiki/Black_comedy": "Black comedy , also known as black humor , dark comedy , dark humor or gallows humor , is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo , particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss . Writers and comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues , by provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience . Thus , in fiction , for example , the term black comedy can also refer to a genre in which dark humor is a core component . Popular themes of the genre include death and violence , discrimination , disease , and human sexuality . Black comedy differs from both blue comedy - which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity , sex , and bodily fluids - and from straightforward obscenity . An archetypal example of black comedy in the form of self-mutilation appears in the English novel Tristram Shandy ; Tristram , five years old at the time , starts to urinate out of an open window for lack of a chamber pot . The sash falls and circumcises him ; his family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance . Whereas the term black comedy is a relatively broad term covering humor relating to many serious subjects , gallows humor tends to be used more specifically in relation to death , or situations that are reminiscent of dying . Black humor can occasionally be related to the grotesque genre . Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes .",
