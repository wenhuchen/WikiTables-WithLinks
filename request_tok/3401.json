  "/wiki/Carnatic_music": "Carnatic music , Karn\u0101\u1e6daka sa\u1e43g\u012bta , or Karn\u0101\u1e6daka sa\u1e45g\u012btam , is a system of music commonly associated with southern India , including the modern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh , Telangana , Karnataka , Kerala , and Tamil Nadu , as well as Sri Lanka . It is one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions , the other subgenre being Hindustani music , which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian or Islamic influences from Northern India . The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in g\u0101yaki ( singing ) style . Carnatic music originated in Karnataka near modern day Mysuru and spread to the rest of South India and Sri Lanka by the time of First Europeans in India . Although there are stylistic differences , the basic elements of \u015bruti ( the relative musical pitch ) , swara ( the musical sound of a single note ) , r\u0101ga ( the mode or melodic formul\u00e6 ) , and tala ( the rhythmic cycles ) form the foundation of improvisation and composition in both Carnatic and Hindustani music . Although improvisation plays an important role , Carnatic music is mainly sung through compositions , especially the kriti ( or kirtanam ) - a form developed between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as Purandara Dasa and the Trinity of Carnatic music . Carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions . Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians , consisting of a principal performer ( usually a vocalist ) , a melodic accompaniment ( usually a violin ) , a rhythm accompaniment ( usually a mridangam ) , and a tambura , which acts as a drone throughout the performance . Other typical instruments used in performances may include the ghatam , kanjira , morsing , venu flute , veena , and chitraveena . The greatest concentration of Carnatic musicians is to be found in the city of Chennai . Various Carnatic music festivals are held throughout India and abroad , including the Madras Music Season , which has been considered to be one of the world 's largest cultural events .",
