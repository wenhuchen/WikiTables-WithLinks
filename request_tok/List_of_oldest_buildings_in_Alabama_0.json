Before being elected to the presidency , Jackson gained fame as a general in the United States Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress .

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Portico": "A portico is a porch leading to the entrance of a building , or extended as a colonnade , with a roof structure over a walkway , supported by columns or enclosed by walls .

Porticos are sometimes topped with pediments . Palladio was a pioneer of using temple-fronts for secular buildings . In the UK , the temple-front applied to The Vyne , Hampshire , was the first portico applied to an English country house . A pronaos ( UK : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0252s/ or US : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0259s/ ) is the inner area of the portico of a Greek or Roman temple , situated between the portico 's colonnade or walls and the entrance to the cella , or shrine . Roman temples commonly had an open pronaos , usually with only columns and no walls , and the pronaos could be as long as the cella . The word pronaos is Greek for before a temple .

An addition was made in the 1860s or 1870s to the rear of the western pen which features a Greek Revival mantle .

The physical geography of the Black Belt , as related to the history of this cotton-dependent region , refers to a much larger region of the Southern United States , stretching from Delaware to Texas but centered on the Black Belt of uplands areas of Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi and Louisiana . In the antebellum and Jim Crow eras , the white elite of the Black Belt dominated Alabama state politics well into the 1960s . As in other Southern states , the white-dominated state legislature of Alabama passed laws and a constitution that created barriers to voter registration , essentially disfranchising most blacks and many poor whites . In addition , the state legislature did not redistrict congressional or state legislative districts after 1901 until it did so in the 1960s under US Supreme Court order . The white rural elite continued to dominate the state despite the rise of urbanized , industrial cities such as Birmingham , Alabama .
