  "/wiki/William_Godwin": "William Godwin ( 3 March 1756 - 7 April 1836 ) was an English journalist , political philosopher and novelist . He is considered one of the first exponents of utilitarianism and the first modern proponent of anarchism . Godwin is most famous for two books that he published within the space of a year : An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice , an attack on political institutions , and Things as They Are ; or , The Adventures of Caleb Williams , an early mystery novel which attacks aristocratic privilege . Based on the success of both , Godwin featured prominently in the radical circles of London in the 1790s . He wrote prolifically in the genres of novels , history and demography throughout his life . In the conservative reaction to British radicalism , Godwin was attacked , in part because of his marriage to the pioneering feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft in 1797 and his candid biography of her after her death from childbirth . Their daughter , later known as Mary Shelley , would go on to write Frankenstein and marry the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley . With his second wife , Mary Jane Clairmont , Godwin set up The Juvenile Library , allowing the family to write their own works for children ( sometimes using noms de plume ) and translate and publish many other books , some of enduring significance . Godwin has had considerable influence on British literature and literary culture .",
  "/wiki/Philip_Henry_Gosse": "Philip Henry Gosse FRS ( /\u0261\u0252s/ ; 6 April 1810 - 23 August 1888 ) , known to his friends as Henry , was an English naturalist and popularizer of natural science , virtually the inventor of the seawater aquarium , and a painstaking innovator in the study of marine biology . Gosse created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853 , and coined the term aquarium when he published the first manual , The Aquarium : An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea , in 1854 . His work was the catalyst for an aquarium craze in early Victorian England . Gosse was also the author of Omphalos , an attempt to reconcile the geological ages presupposed by Charles Lyell with the biblical account of creation . After his death , Gosse was portrayed as a despotic father of uncompromising religious views in Father and Son ( 1907 ) , a memoir written by his son , Edmund Gosse , a poet and critic .",

He was the second Astronomer Royal in Britain , succeeding John Flamsteed in 1720 . From an observatory he constructed on Saint Helena , Halley recorded a transit of Mercury across the Sun . He realised a similar transit of Venus could be used to determine the size of the Solar System . He also used his observations to expand contemporary star maps . He aided in observationally proving Isaac Newton 's laws of motion , and funded the publication of Newton 's influential Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica . From his September 1682 observations , he used the laws of motion to compute the periodicity of Halley 's Comet in his 1705 Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets . It was named after him upon its predicted return in 1758 , which he did not live to see . Beginning in 1698 , he made sailing expeditions and made observations on the conditions of terrestrial magnetism . In 1718 , he discovered the proper motion of the fixed stars .",

  "/wiki/Hackney_Central": "Hackney Central is a sub-district of Hackney in the London Borough of Hackney in London , England and is four miles ( 6.4 km ) northeast of Charing Cross . The Hackney Central area is focused on Mare Street and the retail areas to the north of it including Narrow Way and surrounding local area around Hackney Downs railway station . As such it extends north from Regent 's Canal ( with Bethnal Green ) , takes in most of Broadway Market and London Fields , and follows each side of Mare Street till it terminates in the vicinity of Hackney Central railway station . The area also includes the central retail area which extends from Hackney Downs station in the west to the Hackney Walk Outlet Village , on Morning Lane and goes in between Wick Road ( Homerton ) and Cassland Road ( South Hackney ) till meeting Hackney Wick , to the east . Hackney Central is the area that once would have been known as Hackney Village . This was a place that flourished from the Tudor period , when principal members of the Court had their houses in the surrounding area , and King Henry VIII of England had a palace ( located near the modern Lea Bridge Road roundabout ) . Hackney Central remained a popular resort for Londoners until the end of the Georgian era , when this suburb of London began to be completely built up . Railways , trams and factories brought an end to Hackney 's rural atmosphere during the Victorian era , and its fortunes declined . The industries of nearby Homerton and the Lee Valley have largely disappeared , leaving the NHS and local council as the largest employers . Successive waves of immigrants , both from abroad and within the United Kingdom , make modern Hackney a culturally vibrant part of inner London , with both the benefits and challenges that this brings . Extensive post-World War II redevelopment replaced much of the housing stock , but the Georgian housing and Victorian terraces that remain have become popular again .",

  "/wiki/Actuary": "An actuary is a business professional who deals with the measurement and management of risk and uncertainty ( BeAnActuary 2011a ) . The name of the corresponding field is actuarial science . These risks can affect both sides of the balance sheet and require asset management , liability management , and valuation skills ( BeAnActuary 2011b ) . Actuaries provide assessments of financial security systems , with a focus on their complexity , their mathematics , and their mechanisms ( Trowbridge 1989 , p. 7 ) . While the concept of insurance dates to antiquity ( Johnston 1903 , \u00a7475-\u00a7476 , Loan 1992 , Lewin 2007 , pp . 3-4 ) , the concepts needed to scientifically measure and mitigate risks have their origins in the 17th century studies of probability and annuities ( Heywood 1985 ) . Actuaries of the 21st century require analytical skills , business knowledge , and an understanding of human behavior and information systems to design and manage programs that control risk ( BeAnActuary 2011c ) . The actual steps needed to become an actuary are usually country-specific ; however , almost all processes share a rigorous schooling or examination structure and take many years to complete ( Feldblum 2001 , p. 6 , Institute and Faculty of Actuaries 2014 ) . The profession has consistently been ranked as one of the most desirable ( Riley 2013 ) . In various studies , being an actuary was ranked number one or two multiple times since 2010 ( Thomas 2012 , Weber 2013 , CareerCast 2015 ) .",

  "/wiki/Ur": "Ur ( /\u028a\u0259r/ ; Sumerian : Urim ; Sumerian Cuneiform : \ud808\udec0\ud808\udc15\ud808\udda0 URIM2KI or \ud808\udec0\ud808\udc0a\ud808\udda0 URIM5KI ; Akkadian : Uru ; Arabic : \u0623\u0648\u0631 ; Hebrew : \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 ) was an important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia , located at the site of modern Tell el-Muqayyar ( Arabic : \u062a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u064a\u0631 ) in south Iraq 's Dhi Qar Governorate . Although Ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf , the coastline has shifted and the city is now well inland , on the south bank of the Euphrates , 16 kilometres ( 9.9 miles ) from Nasiriyah in modern-day Iraq . The city dates from the Ubaid period circa 3800 BC , and is recorded in written history as a city-state from the 26th century BC , its first recorded king being Mesannepada . The city 's patron deity was Nanna ( in Akkadian , Sin ) , the Sumerian and Akkadian ( Assyrian-Babylonian ) moon god , and the name of the city is in origin derived from the god 's name . UNUGKI , literally the abode ( UNUG ) of Nanna . The site is marked by the partially restored ruins of the Ziggurat of Ur , which contained the shrine of Nanna , excavated in the 1930s . The temple was built in the 21st century BC ( short chronology ) , during the reign of Ur-Nammu and was reconstructed in the 6th century BC by Nabonidus , the last king of Babylon . The ruins cover an area of 1,200 metres ( 3,900 ft ) northwest to southeast by 800 metres ( 2,600 ft ) northeast to southwest and rise up to about 20 metres ( 66 ft ) above the present plain level .",
  "/wiki/Upper_Clapton": "Upper Clapton is a district in the London Borough of Hackney , forming part of Clapton in northeast London , England . Upper Clapton approximates to the northern part of the E5 ( Clapton ) postal district . The district borders the River Lea ( spelled Lea or Lee ) to the east and the border with Lower Clapton to the south is marked by the Lea Bridge and Kenninghall Roads . Neither Upper Clapton nor the wider Clapton area have ever been an administrative unit and consequently their extent has never been formally determined . Describing Upper Clapton as northern E5 is useful but also informal and imperfect , for instance a small area of Clapton Common and the immediately adjacent community is excluded from the postal district despite almost always being publicly viewed as being part of Upper Clapton . As is frequently the case with London districts , these boundaries are often uncertain and overlapping because of the meeting of the developing expansion of the original settlements . Western parts of the area are often considered part of a wider Stamford Hill , understandable perhaps because of the public transport junction and shopping area at Stamford Broadway , and that the Hasidic Jewish community identified as being located in Stamford Hill extends into Upper Clapton ."
