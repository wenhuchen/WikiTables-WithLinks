  "/wiki/Main_Street_(Amherst,_New_York)": "New York State Route 5 ( NY 5 ) is a state highway that extends for 370.80 miles ( 596.74 km ) across the state of New York in the United States . It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in the Chautauqua County town of Ripley and passes through Buffalo , Syracuse , Utica , Schenectady , and several other smaller cities and communities on its way to downtown Albany in Albany County , where it terminates at U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) , here routed along the service roads for Interstate 787 ( I-787 ) . Prior to the construction of the New York State Thruway , it was one of two main east-west highways traversing upstate New York , the other being US 20 . West of New York , NY 5 continues as Pennsylvania Route 5 ( PA 5 ) to Erie . NY 5 overlaps with US 20 twice along its routing . The second , a 68-mile ( 109 km ) overlap through western and central New York , is the second-longest concurrency in the state , stretching from Avon east to the city of Auburn in Cayuga County . The concurrency is known locally as Routes 5 and 20 . As the route proceeds across the state , it also directly or indirectly meets every major north-south highway in upstate New York , including all three north-south Interstate Highways ( I-390 in Avon , I-81 in Syracuse via US 11 , and I-87 in Albany ) . NY 5 was assigned in 1924 as a true cross-state highway , extending from the Pennsylvania state line in the west to the Massachusetts state line in the east , mostly by way of modern US 20 . At the time , modern NY 5 between Buffalo and Albany was designated as New York State Route 5A . By 1926 , NY 5 was moved onto the routing of NY 5A while the old routing of NY 5 became NY 7 . It was truncated in 1927 to Athol Springs in the west and Albany in the east following the assignment of US 20 , and again in 1930 to downtown Buffalo .",

  "/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York": "Buffalo is the second largest city in the U.S. state of New York and the largest city in Western New York . As of 2018 [ update ] , the population was 256,304 . The city is the county seat of Erie County and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the Canada-United States border , forming part of the bi-national Buffalo Niagara Region . As of the April 1 , 2010 , the metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) had a population of 1,135,509 ; the combined statistical area ( CSA ) , which adds Cattaraugus County , had a population of 1,215,826 inhabitants . The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls . Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname The City of Light . The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by Joseph Ellicott , an extensive system of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted , as well as significant architectural works .",
