Responsible government , though , requires the sovereign or her viceroy , the Governor General of Canada , to almost always follow only that advice tendered by the Cabinet : a committee within the Privy Council composed usually of elected Members of Parliament . Those summoned to the QPC are appointed for life by the Governor General as directed by the Prime Minister of Canada , meaning that the group is composed predominantly of former cabinet ministers , with some others having been inducted as an honorary gesture .

The position originated in England . Some Commonwealth countries have either abolished the position , or re-named it so as to remove monarchical connotations , for example , Senior Counsel or Senior Advocate . Queen 's Counsel is an office , conferred by the Crown , that is recognised by courts . Members have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court . The term is recognised as an honorific . As members wear silk gowns of a particular design ( see court dress ) , appointment as Queen 's Counsel is known informally as taking silk and QCs are often colloquially called silks . Appointments are made from within the legal profession on the basis of merit rather than a particular level of experience . However , successful applicants tend to be barristers , or ( in Scotland ) advocates with 15 years of experience or more .",

After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army .
