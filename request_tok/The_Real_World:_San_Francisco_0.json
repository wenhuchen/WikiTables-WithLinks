  "/wiki/Photography": "Photography is the art , application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation , either electronically by means of an image sensor , or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film . It is employed in many fields of science , manufacturing ( e.g. , photolithography ) , and business , as well as its more direct uses for art , film and video production , recreational purposes , hobby , and mass communication . Typically , a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure . With an electronic image sensor , this produces an electrical charge at each pixel , which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing . The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image , which is later chemically developed into a visible image , either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing . A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base , known as a print , either by using an enlarger or by contact printing .",

  "/wiki/Cum_laude": "Latin honors are Latin phrases used in some colleges and universities to indicate the level of distinction with which an academic degree has been earned . This system is primarily used in the United States and Canada . It is also used in some Southeastern Asian countries with European colonial history , such as Indonesia and the Philippines , although sometimes translations of these phrases are used instead of the Latin originals . The honors distinction should not be confused with the honors degrees offered in some countries , or with honorary degrees . Generally , a college or university 's regulations set out definite criteria a student must meet to obtain a given honor . For example , the student might be required to achieve a specific grade point average , submit an honors thesis for evaluation , be part of an honors program , or graduate early . Each university sets its own standards . Since these standards vary , the same level of Latin honors conferred by different institutions can represent different levels of achievement . Similarly , some institutions grant equivalent ( or additional ) non-Latin honors to undergraduates . The University of Wisconsin-Madison , for example , has a series of plain English grading honors based on class standing . These honors , when they are used , are almost always awarded to undergraduates earning their bachelor 's , and , with the exception of law school graduates , much more rarely to graduate students receiving their master 's or doctorate degree . The honor is typically indicated on the diploma .",

  "/wiki/HIV-positive": "The human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIV ) are two species of Lentivirus ( a subgroup of retrovirus ) that infect humans . Over time they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive . Without treatment , average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years , depending on the HIV subtype . In most cases , HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood , pre-ejaculate , semen , and vaginal fluids . Research has shown ( for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples ) that HIV is untransmissable through condomless sexual intercourse if the HIV-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load . Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy , during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid , and through breast milk . Within these bodily fluids , HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells . HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system , such as helper T cells ( specifically CD4+ T cells ) , macrophages , and dendritic cells . HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms , including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells , apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells , direct viral killing of infected cells , and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells . When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level , cell-mediated immunity is lost , and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections , leading to the development of AIDS .",
  "/wiki/AIDS": "Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms , or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness . Typically , this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms . If the infection progresses , it interferes more with the immune system , increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis , as well as other opportunistic infections , and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function . These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss . HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex ( including anal and oral sex ) , contaminated blood transfusions , hypodermic needles , and from mother to child during pregnancy , delivery , or breastfeeding . Some bodily fluids , such as saliva , sweat and tears , do not transmit the virus . HIV is a member of the group of viruses known as retroviruses . Methods of prevention include safe sex , needle exchange programs , treating those who are infected , pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis , and male circumcision . Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication . There is no cure or vaccine ; however , antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy .",

The city of Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century and due to its strategic location it served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas , becoming a stopping point for treasure-laden Spanish galleons returning to Spain . The King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592 . Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city .

While the exodus was triggered by a sharp downturn in the Cuban economy , it followed on the heels of generations of Cubans who had emigrated to the United States in the preceding decades in search of political freedom and economic opportunities . After approximately 10,000 Cubans tried to gain asylum by taking refuge on the grounds of the Peruvian embassy , the Cuban government announced that anyone who wanted to leave could do so . The ensuing mass migration was organized by Cuban Americans with the agreement of Cuban president Fidel Castro . The arrival of the refugees in the United States created political problems for President Jimmy Carter . His administration struggled to develop a consistent response to the immigrants , and it was discovered that a number of the refugees had been released from Cuban jails and mental health facilities . The Mariel boatlift was ended by mutual agreement between the two governments in late October 1980 . By that time as many as 125,000 Cubans had reached Florida .",
