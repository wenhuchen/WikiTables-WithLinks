  "/wiki/Among_Giants": "Among Giants is a 1998 British film directed by Sam Miller and written by Simon Beaufoy . It is set in Yorkshire , and stars Pete Postlethwaite , Rachel Griffiths and James Thornton . The plot came about after Beaufoy was refused permission to make a documentary on electricity pylon painters in Pembrokeshire , and converted the idea into fiction . The script predates that of The Full Monty , but only found a producer in the wake of the earlier film 's success . The practicalities of shooting atop electricity pylons , not to mention insurance difficulties , meant that a safer mock-up pylon was made for the actors . This proved unconvincing : Postlethwaite remarked that I do n't believe we are up there , and if you do n't sell that shot you do n't sell the rest of the pylons , and so some material was re-shot on real pylons after training from Electricity Board climbing experts . Around the time of the film 's release , the Bedford van converted for use as a camper van - dubbed the shagging wagon in the film - was stolen and burnt out in Sheffield .",
