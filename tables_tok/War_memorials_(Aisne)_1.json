        "Saint Quentin , one of the major cities of the Aisne region , suffered major damage during the Great War . The war memorial , designed by the Prix de Rome winning architect Paul Bigot , has bas-reliefs by Henri Bouchard and Paul Landowski . The Saint-Quentin monument aux morts was unveiled on 31 July 1927 in the presence of General Debeney . Bigot built a 31 metre long monument which consisted of nine columns supporting one huge pediment and on these columns are inscribed the names of those who died in the Great War , whether as soldiers or civilians killed during the German occupation . On the pediment itself are three bas-reliefs . That at the centre shows life in the trenches and scenes from the civilian exodus of March 1917 and at each end are bas-reliefs , one depicting a scene from 1870 and the other remembering the conflict of 1557 . The wording on the monument was subsequently changed to remember those who had lain down their lives in the 1939-1945 conflict",
