  "/wiki/Louis_Agassiz": "Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0261\u0259si/ ; French : [ a\u0261asi ] ; May 28 , 1807 - December 14 , 1873 ) was a Swiss biologist and geologist recognized as an innovative and prodigious scholar of Earth 's natural history . Agassiz grew up in Switzerland . He received doctor of philosophy and medical degrees at Erlangen and Munich , respectively . After studying with Cuvier and Humboldt in Paris , Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel . He emigrated to the United States in 1847 after visiting Harvard University . He went on to become professor of zoology and geology at Harvard , to head its Lawrence Scientific School , and to found its Museum of Comparative Zoology . Agassiz is known for his regimen of observational data gathering and analysis . He made vast institutional and scientific contributions to zoology , geology , and related areas , including writing multivolume research books running to thousands of pages . He is particularly known for his contributions to ichthyological classification , including of extinct species such as megalodon , and to the study of geological history , including to the founding of glaciology . In the 20th and 21st centuries , Agassiz 's resistance to Darwinian evolution , belief in creationism , and the scientific racism implicit in his writings on human polygenism have tarnished his reputation , and led to controversies over his legacy .",
  "/wiki/Ice_age": "An ice age is a long period of reduction in the temperature of the Earth 's surface and atmosphere , resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers . Earth 's climate alternates between ice ages and greenhouse periods , during which there are no glaciers on the planet . Earth is currently in the Quaternary glaciation , known in popular terminology as the Ice Age . Individual pulses of cold climate within an ice age are termed glacial periods ( or , alternatively , glacials , glaciations , glacial stages , stadials , stades , or colloquially , ice ages ) , and intermittent warm periods within an ice age are called interglacials or interstadials , with both climatic pulses part of the Quaternary or other periods in Earth 's history . In the terminology of glaciology , ice age implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in both northern and southern hemispheres . By this definition , we are in an interglacial period - the Holocene . The amount of heat trapping gases emitted into Earth 's oceans and atmosphere are predicted to prevent the next glacial period , which otherwise would begin in around 50,000 years , and likely more glacial cycles .",

  "/wiki/Louis_Lliboutry": "Louis Lliboutry ( born 19 February 1922 in Madrid ; died on 21 October 2007 in Grenoble ) was a French glaciologist , geophysicist , and mountaineer . While in Chile in the early 1950s , he analysed and explained the formation of snow penitents in the Andes , which marked his first contribution to glaciology . He founded in Grenoble in 1958 the Laboratory of Alpine Glaciology and headed it for 25 years ; he also set up at that period a pioneering syllabus in geophysics . His contributions to mechanics of viscous media ( such as ice and the Earth 's mantle ) and to geodynamics are internationally acknowledged .",
  "/wiki/Penitente_(snow_formation)": "Penitentes , or nieves penitentes ( Spanish for penitent-shaped snows ) , are snow formations found at high altitudes . They take the form of elongated , thin blades of hardened snow or ice , closely spaced and pointing towards the general direction of the sun . The name comes from the resemblance of a field of penitentes to a crowd of kneeling people doing penance . The formation evokes the tall , pointed habits and hoods worn by brothers of religious orders in the Processions of Penance during Spanish Holy Week . In particular the brothers ' hats are tall , narrow , and white , with a pointed top . These spires of snow and ice grow over all glaciated and snow-covered areas in the Dry Andes above 4,000 metres or 13,120 feet . They range in length from a few centimetres to over 5 metres or 16 feet .",
  "/wiki/Mark_Meier": "Mark F. Meier ( 1925 - November 25 , 2012 ) was an American glaciologist who was considered a leading expert on the study of rising sea levels due to the melting of glaciers . Meier was the Director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research ( INSTAAR ) from 1985 to 1994 and remained the institute 's director emeritus until his death in 2012 . He was also a professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado - Boulder . Meier was born and raised in Iowa . He resided in Boulder , Colorado , since 1985 . In 1956 , Meier founded the U.S. Geological Survey 's department of glaciology . He obtained doctorate in 1957 from the California Institute of Technology . Meier served as the director of the U.S. Geological Survey 's Project Office of Glaciology in Tacoma , Washington , until he became the director of INSTAAR in 1985 . Meier was one of the first glaciologists to use remote sensing to study glaciers and rates of melting . He headed several studies of tidewater glacier dynamics in the U.S. state of Alaska . Meier organized the systematic measurement and assessment of glacier mass balance within North America to mark the International Geophysical Year and International Hydrological Decade , which was observed from 1965 to 1975 . His numerous recognitions and awards included the Seligman Crystal from the International Glaciological Society in 1985 , the Robert E.

  "/wiki/Glacier_motion": "Glacial motion is the motion of glaciers , which can be likened to rivers of ice . It has played an important role in sculpting many landscapes . Most lakes in the world occupy basins scoured out by glaciers . Glacial motion can be fast ( up to 30 m/day , observed on Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6 in Greenland ) or slow ( 0.5 m/year on small glaciers or in the center of ice sheets ) , but is typically around 25 cm/day .",
