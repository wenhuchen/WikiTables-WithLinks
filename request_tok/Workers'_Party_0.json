The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .

  "/wiki/Social_democracy": "Social democracy is a political , social and economic philosophy that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented economy . The protocols and norms used to accomplish this involve a commitment to representative and participatory democracy , measures for income redistribution , regulation of the economy in the general interest and social welfare provisions . Due to longstanding governance by social democratic parties during the post-war consensus and their influence on socioeconomic policy in the Nordic countries , social democracy became associated with the Nordic model and Keynesianism within political circles in the late 20th century . It has also been seen by some political commentators as a synonym for modern socialism and as overlapping with democratic socialism . While having socialism as a long-term goal , social democracy aims to create the conditions for capitalism to lead to greater democratic , egalitarian and solidaristic outcomes . It is characterized by a commitment to policies aimed at curbing inequality , eliminating oppression of underprivileged groups and eradicating poverty as well as support for universally accessible public services like care for the elderly , child care , education , health care and workers ' compensation . It often has strong connections with the labour movement and trade unions , being supportive of collective bargaining rights for workers and measures to extend decision-making beyond politics into the economic sphere in the form of co-determination for employees and stakeholders . Social democracy originated as an ideology within the socialist and labour movements , whose goal at different times has been a social revolution to move away from capitalism to a post-capitalist economy such as socialism , a peaceful revolution as in the case of evolutionary socialism , or the establishment and support of a welfare state . Its origins lie in the 1860s as a revolutionary socialism associated with orthodox Marxism . Starting in the 1890s , there was a dispute between committed revolutionary social democrats such as Rosa Luxemburg and reformist social democrats as well as Marxist revisionists such as Eduard Bernstein , who supported a more gradual approach grounded in liberal democracy , with Karl Kautsky representing a centrist position . By the 1920s , social democracy became the dominant political tendency along with communism within the international socialist movement . By the 1920s , social democracy had spread worldwide and transitioned towards advocating an evolutionary and peaceful change from capitalism to socialism using established political processes .",

The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism-Leninism is that the peasantry are the revolutionary vanguard in pre-industrial societies rather than the proletariat . This updating and adaptation of Marxism-Leninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary praxis is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism-Leninism adapted to pre-industrial China . The claim that Mao Zedong had adapted Marxism-Leninism to Chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had updated it in a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole . From the 1950s until the Chinese economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s , Maoism was the political and military ideology of the Communist Party of China and of Maoist revolutionary movements throughout the world . After the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s , the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union claimed to be the sole heir and successor to Joseph Stalin concerning the correct interpretation of Marxism-Leninism and ideological leader of world communism . In the late 1970s , the Peruvian communist party Shining Path developed and synthesized Maoism into Marxism-Leninism-Maoism , a contemporary variety of Marxism-Leninism that is a supposed higher level of Marxism-Leninism that can be applied universally .",

  "/wiki/Marxism": "Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that views class relations and social conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and takes a dialectical view of social transformation . It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels . Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought , with the result that there is now no single definitive Marxist theory . Different Marxian schools place a greater emphasis on certain aspects of classical Marxism while rejecting or modifying other aspects . Many schools of thought have sought to combine Marxian concepts and non-Marxian concepts which has then led to contradictory conclusions . It has been argued that there is a movement toward the recognition that historical materialism and dialectical materialism remains the fundamental aspect of all Marxist schools of thought . This view is refuted by some post-Marxists such as Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe , who claim that history is not only determined by the mode of production , but also by consciousness and will . Marxism has had a profound impact on global academia and has influenced many fields such as archaeology , anthropology , media studies , science studies , political science , theater , history , sociology , art history and theory , cultural studies , education , economics , ethics , criminology , geography , literary criticism , aesthetics , film theory , critical psychology and philosophy .",

  "/wiki/Democratic_socialist": "Democratic socialism is a political philosophy supporting political democracy within a socially owned economy , with a particular emphasis on workers ' self-management and democratic control of economic institutions within a market socialist economy or some form of a decentralised planned socialist economy . Democratic socialists argue that capitalism is inherently incompatible with the values of freedom , equality and solidarity and that these ideals can only be achieved through the realisation of a socialist society . Although most democratic socialists seek a gradual transition to socialism , democratic socialism can support either revolutionary or reformist politics as means to establish socialism . As a term , it was popularised by social democrats who were opposed to the authoritarian socialist development in Russia and elsewhere during the 20th century . The origins of democratic socialism can be traced to 19th-century utopian socialist thinkers and the British Chartist movement that somewhat differed in their goals yet all shared the essence of democratic decision making and public ownership of the means of production as positive characteristics of the society they advocated for . In the late 19th century and early 20th century , democratic socialism was also influenced by social democracy . The gradualist form of socialism promoted by the British Fabian Society and Eduard Bernstein 's evolutionary socialism in Germany influenced the development of democratic socialism . Democratic socialism is what most socialists understand by the concept of socialism . It may be a very broad or more limited concept , referring to all forms of socialism that are democratic and reject an authoritarian Marxist-Leninist state , including libertarian socialism , market socialism , reformist socialism and revolutionary socialism as well as ethical socialism , liberal socialism , social democracy and some forms of democratic state socialism and utopian socialism . Democratic socialism is contrasted to Marxism-Leninism which is viewed as being authoritarian or undemocratic in practice . Democratic socialists oppose the Stalinist political system and the Soviet-type economic system , rejecting the perceived authoritarian form of governance and the centralised administrative command economy that took form in the Soviet Union and other Marxist-Leninist states during the 20th century . Democratic socialism is also distinguished from Third Way social democracy on the basis that democratic socialists are committed to systemic transformation of the economy from capitalism to socialism whereas social democratic supporters of the Third Way were more concerned about challenging the New Right and win social democracy back to power .",

  "/wiki/Workers'_Party_of_Social_Justice": "Workers ' Party of Social Justice ( Czech : D\u011blnick\u00e1 strana soci\u00e1ln\u00ed spravedlnosti ) is a Czech political party , often described as the major far-right extremist party in the Czech Republic . The party is not represented in any legislative body in the Czech Republic and its biggest electoral success so far has been a gain of 1,14% in the Czech legislative election in 2010 . Some of the high-ranking party officials , including a Prague party leader , have been associated with neo-nazi groups such as N\u00e1rodn\u00ed odpor , the Czech subsidiary of an international militant neo-nazi group . In spring 2009 the petition for the ban on the party was dismissed by the Czech Supreme Administrative Court , because , as the presiding judge stated , the applicant ( Czech government ) did n't manage to provide sufficient evidence in what was seen as a botched application . Following violent attacks against Czech minorities by far-right extremists ( such as the V\u00edtkov arson attack of 2009 ) , the government filed a more detailed petition for the ban , which was discussed by the Czech Supreme Court in January and February 2010 . The party was banned , making it the first instance of banning a party for its ideology in the modern history of the Czech Republic . The party was transformed into a Party of Citizens of the Czech Republic and the party was renamed to Workers ' Party of Social Justice .

Nazism is a form of fascism and showed that ideology 's disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system , but also incorporated fervent antisemitism , anti-communism , scientific racism , and eugenics into its creed . Its extreme nationalism came from Pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist v\u00f6lkisch movement prominent in the German nationalism of the time , and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany 's defeat in World War I , from which came the party 's cult of violence which was at the heart of the movement . Nazism subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism , identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race . It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people 's community ( Volksgemeinschaft ) . The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory , as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum and exclude those who they deemed either community aliens or inferior races . The term National Socialism arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of socialism , as an alternative to both Marxist international socialism and free market capitalism . Nazism rejected the Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality , opposed cosmopolitan internationalism , and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the common good , accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organization , which tended to match the general outlook of collectivism or communitarianism rather than economic socialism . The Nazi Party 's precursor , the Pan-German nationalist and antisemitic German Workers ' Party , was founded on 5 January 1919 . By the early 1920s the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers ' Party - to attract workers away from left-wing parties such as the Social Democrats ( SPD ) and the Communists ( KPD ) - and Adolf Hitler assumed control of the organization . The National Socialist Program or 25 Points was adopted in 1920 and called for a united Greater Germany that would deny citizenship to Jews or those of Jewish descent , while also supporting land reform and the nationalization of some industries . In Mein Kampf ( My Struggle ; 1924-1925 ) , Hitler outlined the anti-Semitism and anti-Communism at the heart of his political philosophy , as well as his disdain for representative democracy and his belief in Germany 's right to territorial expansion .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

  "/wiki/Communism": "Communism ( from Latin communis , common , universal ) is a philosophical , social , political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society , namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes , money and the state . Communism includes a variety of schools of thought which broadly include Marxism and anarchism ( especially anarcho-communism ) as well as the political ideologies grouped around both . All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system and mode of production , capitalism ; that in this system there are two major social classes ; that conflict between these two classes is the root of all problems in society ; and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a social revolution . The two classes are the proletariat ( the working class ) - who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society - and the bourgeoisie ( the capitalist class ) - a minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the means of production . According to this analysis , revolution would put the working class in power and in turn establish social ownership of the means of production which is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism . Along with social democracy , communism became the dominant political tendency within the international socialist movement by the 1920s . While the emergence of the Soviet Union as the world 's first nominally communist state led to communism 's widespread association with the Soviet economic model and Marxism-Leninism , some economists and intellectuals argued that in practice the model functioned as a form of state capitalism , or a non-planned administrative or command economy .",

Marxist-Leninists espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of orthodox Marxism and Leninism , but they generally support the idea of a vanguard party , a communist party-led state , state-dominance over the economy , internationalism and opposition to capitalism , fascism , imperialism and liberal democracy . As an ideology , it was developed by Joseph Stalin in the late 1920s based on his understanding and synthesis of both orthodox Marxism and Leninism . It was the official state ideology of the Soviet Union and the other ruling parties making up the Eastern Bloc as well as the political parties of the Communist International after Bolshevisation . Today , Marxism-Leninism is the ideology of Stalinist and Maoist political parties around the world and remains the official ideology of the ruling parties of China , Cuba , Laos and Vietnam . After the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924 , Marxism-Leninism became a distinct philosophical movement in the Soviet Union when Stalin and his supporters gained control of the party . It rejected the common notions among Marxists at the time of world revolution as a prerequisite for building socialism in Russia in favour of the concept of socialism in one country . According to its supporters , the gradual transition from capitalism to socialism was signified with the introduction of the first five-year plan and the 1936 Soviet Constitution . The internationalism of Marxism-Leninism was expressed in supporting revolutions in foreign countries ( e.g . initially through the Communist International or through the concept of socialist-leaning countries after de-Stalinisation ) . By the late 1920s , Stalin established ideological orthodoxy among the Russian Communist Party ( Bolsheviks ) , the Soviet Union and the Communist International to establish universal Marxist-Leninist praxis . In the late 1930s , Stalin 's official textbook History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( Bolsheviks ) ( 1938 ) made the term Marxism-Leninism common political-science usage among communists and non-communists .",

  "/wiki/Socialism": "Socialism is a political , social and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production and workers ' self-management of enterprise , including the political theories and movements associated with such systems . Social ownership can be public , collective or cooperative ownership , or citizen ownership of equity . There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them , with social ownership being the common element shared by its various forms . Socialist systems are divided into non-market and market forms . Non-market socialism involves replacing factor markets and money with engineering and technical criteria based on calculation performed in-kind , thereby producing an economic mechanism that functions according to different economic laws from those of capitalism . Non-market socialism aims to circumvent the inefficiencies and crises traditionally associated with capital accumulation and the profit system . The socialist calculation debate , originated by the economic calculation problem , concerns the feasibility and methods of resource allocation for a planned socialist system . By contrast , market socialism retains the use of monetary prices , factor markets and in some cases the profit motive , with respect to the operation of socially owned enterprises and the allocation of capital goods between them . Profits generated by these firms would be controlled directly by the workforce of each firm , or accrue to society at large in the form of a social dividend . Socialist politics has been both internationalist and nationalist in orientation ; organised through political parties and opposed to party politics ; at times overlapping with trade unions and at other times independent and critical of them ; and present in both industrialised and developing nations . Social democracy originated within the socialist movement , supporting economic and social interventions to promote social justice . While having socialism as a long-term goal , it has come to embrace a Keynesian mixed economy within a predominantly , developed capitalist market economy and liberal democratic polity that includes substantial state intervention in the form of income redistribution , regulation and a welfare state .",

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel , the Irish Sea , and St George 's Channel . Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles , the third-largest in Europe , and the twentieth-largest on Earth . Geopolitically , Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland ( officially named Ireland ) , which covers five-sixths of the island , and Northern Ireland , which is part of the United Kingdom . In 2011 , the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million , ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain . As of 2016 , 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland , and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland . The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature . Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages . Today , woodland makes up about 10% of the island , compared with a European average of over 33% , and most of it is non-native conifer plantations . There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland . The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate , and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area , although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe .",
  "/wiki/Workers'_Party_of_Ireland": "The Workers ' Party ( Irish : P\u00e1irt\u00ed na nOibrithe ) is a Marxist-Leninist political party active in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland . It arose as the original Sinn F\u00e9in organisation founded in 1905 by Arthur Griffith , but took its current form in 1970 following a division within the party , in which it was the larger faction . This majority group continued under the same leadership as Sinn F\u00e9in ( Gardiner Place ) or Official Sinn F\u00e9in , while the breakaway group became known as Sinn F\u00e9in ( Kevin Street ) or Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in ( giving rise to the contemporary party known as Sinn F\u00e9in ) . The party name was changed to Sinn F\u00e9in - The Workers ' Party in 1977 and then to the Workers ' Party in 1982 . Throughout its history , the party has been closely associated with the Official Irish Republican Army . Notable organisations that derived from it include Democratic Left and the Irish Republican Socialist Party . The party has one representative at local government level : Ted Tynan on Cork City Council .",

It borders Bosnia-Herzegovina to the northwest , Serbia to the northeast , Kosovo [ a ] to the east , Albania to the southeast , the Adriatic Sea to the southwest , and Croatia to the west . Montenegro has an area of 13,812 square kilometres and a population of 620,079 ( 2011 census ) . Its capital Podgorica is one of the twenty-three municipalities in the country . Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital . During the Early Medieval period , three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro : Duklja , roughly corresponding to the southern half ; Travunia , the west ; and Rascia proper , the north . In 1042 , archon Stefan Vojislav led a revolt that resulted in the independence of Duklja from the Byzantine Empire and the establishment of the Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty . After being ruled by the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty for two centuries , the independent Principality of Zeta emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries , ruled by the House of Bal\u0161i\u0107 between 1356 and 1421 , and by the House of Crnojevi\u0107 between 1431 and 1498 , when the name Montenegro started being used for the country . After falling under Ottoman rule , Montenegro regained de facto independence in 1697 under the rule of the House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 , first under the theocratic rule of prince-bishops , before being transformed into a secular principality in 1852 . Montenegro 's de jure independence was recognised by the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 , following the Montenegrin-Ottoman War . In 1905 , the country became a kingdom . After World War I , it became part of Yugoslavia .",

To the north and northwest , the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok ( known as the Yalu in Chinese ) and Tumen rivers , and to the south , it is bordered by South Korea , with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two . Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed . North Korea officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state , and formally holds elections , though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections . Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship , particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty . The Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , led by a member of the ruling family , holds absolute power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members . Juche , an ideology of national self-reliance , was introduced into the constitution in 1972 .",
  "/wiki/Workers'_Party_of_Korea": "On 13 October 1945 , the North Korean Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea [ ko ] ( NKB-CPK ) was established , with Kim Yong-bom its first chairman . However , the NKB-CPK remained subordinate to the CPK Central Committee ( headquartered in Seoul and headed by Pak Hon-yong ) . Two months later , at the 3rd Plenum of the NKB , Kim Yong-bom was replaced by Kim Il-sung ( an event probably orchestrated by the Soviet Union ) . In spring 1946 the North Korean Bureau became the Communist Party of North Korea , with Kim Il-sung its elected chairman . On 22 July 1946 Soviet authorities in North Korea established the United Democratic National Front , a popular front led by the Communist Party of North Korea . The Communist Party of North Korea soon merged with the New People 's Party of Korea , a party primarily composed of communists from China . On 28 July 1946 a special commission of the two parties ratified the merger , and it became official the following day . One month later ( 28-30 August 1946 ) the party held its founding congress , establishing the Workers ' Party of North Korea ( WPNK ) . The congress elected former leader of the New People 's Party of Korea Kim Tu-bong as the first WPNK chairman , with Kim Il-sung its appointed deputy chairman .

  "/wiki/Juche": "Juche ( Korean : \uc8fc\uccb4/\u4e3b\u9ad4 , lit . 'subject ' ; Korean pronunciation : [ t\u0255ut\u0255\u02b0e ] ; usually left untranslated or translated as self-reliance ) is the official state ideology of North Korea , described by the government as Kim Il-sung 's original , brilliant and revolutionary contribution to national and international thought . It postulates that man is the master of his destiny , that the Korean masses are to act as the masters of the revolution and construction and that by becoming self-reliant and strong , a nation can achieve true socialism . Kim Il-sung ( 1912-1994 ) developed the ideology , originally viewed as a variant of Marxism-Leninism until it became distinctly Korean in character while incorporating the historical materialist ideas of Marxism-Leninism and strongly emphasizing the individual , the nation state and its sovereignty . Consequently , the North Korean government adopted Juche into a set of principles it uses to justify its policy decisions from the 1950s onwards . Such principles include moving the nation towards claimed jaju ( independence ) , through the construction of jarip ( national economy ) and an emphasis upon jawi ( self-defence ) in order to establish socialism . The practice of Juche is firmly rooted in the ideals of sustainability through agricultural independence and a lack of dependency . The Juche ideology has been criticized by many scholars and observers as a mechanism for sustaining the totalitarian rule of the North Korean regime [ full citation needed ] and justifying the country 's heavy-handed isolationism and oppression of the North Korean people . It has also been described as a form of Korean ethnic nationalism , but one that promotes the Kim family as the saviours of the Korean race and acts as a foundation of the subsequent personality cult surrounding them .",

It is bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest , Brazil to the east and northeast , and Bolivia to the northwest . Although it is one of only two landlocked countries in South America ( the other is Bolivia ) , the country has coasts , beaches and ports on the Paraguay and Paran\u00e1 rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay Waterway . Due to its central location in South America , it is sometimes referred to as Coraz\u00f3n de Sudam\u00e9rica ( Heart of South America ) . Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the R\u00edo de la Plata to the Paran\u00e1 River , and finally up the Paraguay River . In 1537 , they established the city of Asunci\u00f3n , which was the first capital of the Governorate of Paraguay and R\u00edo de la Plata . Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions , where the Guaran\u00ed people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions , mainly during the 17th century . However , after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish territories in 1767 , Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony , with few urban centers and settlers . Following independence from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century , Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist , isolationist and protectionist policies . This period ended with the disastrous Paraguayan War , during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25-33% of its territory to the Triple Alliance of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay . In the 20th century , Paraguay faced another major international conflict - the Chaco War - against Bolivia , from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious . Afterwards , the country entered a period of military dictatorships , ending with the 35 year regime of Alfredo Stroessner that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup .",

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",

Since 2011 , the Workers ' Party has been the only opposition party in Singapore to have elected MPs in Parliament . The Workers ' Party was founded on 3 November 1957 by Singapore 's former Chief Minister , David Marshall . In 1981 , the party 's then-leader J . B. Jeyaretnam became the first opposition MP to be elected to Parliament since Singapore 's independence in 1965 , when he defeated the candidate of the governing People 's Action Party ( PAP ) at a by-election in the constituency of Anson . He was re-elected at the 1984 general election , but subsequently lost his seat in Parliament in 1986 following a conviction for falsely accounting the party 's funds , a conviction Jeyaretnam has always maintained was politically motivated . Since the 1991 general election , the party has held the seat of Hougang . Low Thia Khiang was elected as MP for Hougang in 1991 and re-elected at the 1997 , 2001 and 2006 general elections . Low moved to Aljunied GRC for the 2011 general election where he led the first team from an opposition party to win a GRC , while Yaw Shin Leong held the Hougang seat for the party . Yaw was expelled from the party in February 2012 , which triggered a by-election in Hougang . The seat was retained by the Workers ' Party 's candidate , Png Eng Huat ."
