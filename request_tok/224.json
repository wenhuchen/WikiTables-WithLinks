( Much more common elsewhere in the county and Oklahoma was the dual-use auditorium and gymnasium , such as the WPA built elsewhere in the county in Antlers , Oklahoma , Moyers , Oklahoma and Rattan , Oklahoma . ) Art Deco was the prevalent architectural style during the 1930s , and the auditorium shows hints of it through its angular lines . The building is a single story T-shaped structure built of native untooled and uncoursed stone . According to the 1988 survey the stonework and masonry work are excellent .
