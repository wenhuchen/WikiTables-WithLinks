  "/wiki/Fort_Yellowstone": "Fort Yellowstone was a U.S. Army fort , established in 1891 at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park . Yellowstone was designated in 1872 but the Interior Department was unable to effectively manage the park . Administration was transferred to the War Department in August 1886 and General Philip Sheridan sent a company of cavalry to Mammoth Hot Springs to build a cavalry post . The army originally called the post Camp Sheridan in honor of General Sheridan but the name was changed to Fort Yellowstone in 1891 when construction of the permanent fort commenced . The army administered the park until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created National Park Service . The facilities of Fort Yellowstone now comprise the Yellowstone National Park headquarters , the Horace Albright Visitor Center and staff accommodations . Between the years 1891 and 1913 , a total of 60 structures were erected at Fort Yellowstone , of which 35 were still in existence one hundred years later . The fort was built in two major construction waves . During the first construction period from 1891 to 1897 , mainly wood-framed buildings in what has been referred to as cottage style were built . A few of them had Colonial Revival architectural elements . A second construction wave began in 1908 and concluded in 1913 . These structures were primarily built from locally quarried sandstone .",

It has many types of ecosystem , but the subalpine forest is the most abundant . It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion . Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years . Aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century , organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s . Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior , the first being Columbus Delano . However , the U.S. Army was subsequently commissioned to oversee management of Yellowstone for a 30-year period between 1886 and 1916 . In 1917 , administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service , which had been created the previous year .

  "/wiki/Obsidian_Cliff": "Obsidian Cliff , also known as 48YE433 , was an important source of lithic materials for prehistoric peoples in Yellowstone National Park near Mammoth Hot Springs , Wyoming , United States .

The cliff was formed from thick rhyolite lava flow that occurred about 180,000 years ago . The vertical columns are cooling fractures that formed as the thick lava flow cooled and crystallized . The Cliffs stand at an elevation of nearly 7,400 feet ( 2,300 m ) above sea level and go on for about half a mile . The cliffs also extend between 150 and 200 feet above Obsidian Creek . The flow consists of obsidian , a dark volcanic glass . The obsidian is most abundant at the base of the cliff and slowly tapers off to larger concentrations of pumice at the top . Obsidian from this site was first quarried here about 12,000 years ago . Early natives of North America placed a high value on the obsidian that came from this cliff as well as other similar obsidian deposits in the area because numerous tools could be fashioned from obsidian - most popularly , knives , spear/arrow tips , and other sharp-edged objects . In fact , obsidian from Obsidian Cliff was so sought after in early America ( before the time of Columbus ) that it was traded as far away as Ohio and Canada .",
