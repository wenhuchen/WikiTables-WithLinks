He is one of the most influential and extensively studied filmmakers in the history of cinema . Known as the Master of Suspense , he directed over 50 feature films [ a ] in a career spanning six decades , becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews , his cameo roles in most of his films , and his hosting and producing of the television anthology Alfred Hitchcock Presents ( 1955-1965 ) . His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins . Born in Leytonstone , Essex , Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company . He made his directorial debut with the silent film The Pleasure Garden ( 1925 ) . His first successful film , The Lodger : A Story of the London Fog ( 1927 ) , helped to shape the thriller genre , while his 1929 film , Blackmail , was the first British talkie . Two of his 1930s thrillers , The 39 Steps ( 1935 ) and The Lady Vanishes ( 1938 ) , are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century .

A string of successful films followed , including Rebecca ( 1940 ) , Foreign Correspondent ( 1940 ) , Suspicion ( 1941 ) , Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) , and Notorious ( 1946 ) . Rebecca won the Academy Award for Best Picture , although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director ; he was also nominated for Lifeboat ( 1944 ) and Spellbound ( 1945 ) , although he never won the Best Director Academy Award .

  "/wiki/Black_Sabbath_(film)": "Black Sabbath ( Italian : I tre volti della paura , lit . 'The Three Faces of Fear ' ) is a 1963 horror anthology film directed by Mario Bava . The film is centered on three separate tales that are introduced by Boris Karloff . The first , titled The Telephone , involves Rosy ( Mich\u00e8le Mercier ) who continually receives threatening telephone calls from an unseen stalker . The second is The Wurdulak , where a man named Gorca ( Karloff ) returns to his family after claiming to have slain a Wurdulak , an undead creature who attacks those that it had once loved . The third story , The Drop of Water , is centered on Helen Corey ( Jacqueline Pierreux ) , a nurse who steals a ring from a corpse that is being prepared for burial and finds herself haunted by the ring 's original owner after arriving home . Being a low-budget horror film with multiple stories , an international cast and foreign financial backing , Black Sabbath follows numerous trends of 1960s Italian film productions . The film is credited to various writers , but is predominantly based on several uncredited sources , and changes were made to the script after filming commenced . American International Pictures and Titra Sound Corporation suggested changes to Bava during filming to make the film palatable for American audiences , and created their own English-language version of the film , which replaced Roberto Nicolosi 's score with music by Les Baxter , removed several depictions of graphic violence and made alterations to other scenes . This version greatly changed the plot of The Telephone , giving it a supernatural element and removing all references to lesbianism and prostitution . Black Sabbath was a commercial failure upon release in Italy , and performed below expectations in America . A spiritual sequel to the film , based on The Dunwich Horror and provisionally titled Scarlet Friday , was set to reunite Bava with Karloff and co-star Christopher Lee , but AIP distanced themselves from Bava following the failure of Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs and eventually produced the film without Bava , Karloff or Lee 's involvement .",
  "/wiki/Mario_Bava": "Mario Bava ( 31 July 1914 - 27 April 1980 ) was an Italian filmmaker who worked variously as a director , screenwriter , cinematographer , and special effects artist . He is frequently referred to as the Master of Italian Horror and the Master of the Macabre . His low-budget genre films , known for their distinctive visual flair and stylish technical ingenuity , feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality , and the destructive capacity of human nature . Born to sculptor , cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava , the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry , and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy 's foremost cameramen , lighting and providing the special effects for such films as Hercules ( 1958 ) and its sequel Hercules Unchained ( 1959 ) ( each were lampooned on Mystery Science Theater 3000 ) . During the late 1950s , his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers , including I Vampiri ( 1957 ) ( the first Italian horror film of the sound era ) , The Day the Sky Exploded ( 1958 ) ( the first Italian science fiction film ) , Caltiki - The Immortal Monster ( 1959 ) and The Giant of Marathon ( 1959 ) . Although most of Bava 's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release , many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics , with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock . Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres : Black Sunday ( 1960 ) , his official directorial debut , was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle ; The Girl Who Knew Too Much ( 1963 ) is considered to be the first giallo film ; Kill , Baby , Kill ( 1966 ) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror ; Roy Colt & Winchester Jack ( 1970 ) is regarded as one of the earliest self-parodying Spaghetti Westerns ; Four Times That Night ( 1971 ) was an early Italian sex comedy ; and A Bay of Blood ( 1971 ) was a precursor to slasher films . His other notable films include Hercules in the Haunted World ( 1961 ) , Erik the Conqueror ( 1961 ) , Black Sabbath ( 1963 ) , The Whip and the Body ( 1963 ) , Blood and Black Lace ( 1964 ) , Planet of the Vampires ( 1965 ) , Knives of the Avenger ( 1966 ) , Danger : Diabolik ( 1968 ) , Hatchet for the Honeymoon ( 1970 ) , Five Dolls for an August Moon ( 1970 ) , Baron Blood ( 1972 ) , Lisa and the Devil ( 1974 ) , Rabid Dogs ( 1974 ) and Shock ( 1977 ) . Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime , Bava 's shy , self-deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry , and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood . Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento , Lucio Fulci , Federico Fellini , John Carpenter , Nicolas Winding Refn , Martin Scorsese , Tim Burton , Joe Dante , John Landis , Francis Ford Coppola , Roger Corman , Edgar Wright , Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino . His son and frequent assistant director , Lamberto Bava , later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right .",

The film stars William Campbell , Patrick Magee , and Luana Anders . It was released in the United States by American International Pictures during the fall of 1963 as the bottom half of a double feature with Corman 's X : The Man with the X-ray Eyes . Although Coppola had been involved in at least two sexploitation films previously , Dementia 13 served as his first mainstream legitimate directorial effort . Corman offered Coppola the chance to direct a low-budget horror film in Ireland using funds left over from Corman 's recently completed The Young Racers , on which Coppola had worked as a sound technician .

Although he was given total directorial freedom during production , Coppola found himself at odds with Corman after the film was completed . The producer declared it unreleasable and demanded several changes be made . Corman eventually brought in another director , Jack Hill , to film additional sequences .

  "/wiki/The_Haunting_(1963_film)": "The Haunting is a 1963 British supernatural psychological horror film directed and produced by Robert Wise and adapted by Nelson Gidding from the novel The Haunting of Hill House ( 1959 ) by Shirley Jackson . It stars Julie Harris , Claire Bloom , Richard Johnson , and Russ Tamblyn . The film depicts the experiences of a small group of people invited by a paranormal investigator to investigate a purportedly haunted house . Screenwriter Gidding , who had worked with director Wise on the film I Want to Live ! ( 1958 ) , began a six-month write of the script after reading the book , which Wise had given to him . He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than ghosts , and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel , elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film . The film was shot at the MGM-British Studios near London , UK on a budget of US $ 1.05 million , with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park ( now the Ettington Park Hotel ) in the village of Ettington , Warwickshire . Julie Harris was cast by Wise , who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor , though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars . The interior sets were by Elliot Scott , credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of The Haunting . They were designed to be brightly lit , with no dark corners or recesses , and decorated in a Rococo style ; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film . Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming . Wise used a 30mm anamorphic , wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions .",

Wise was the president of the Directors Guild of America from 1971 to 1975 and the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1985 through 1988 . Robert Wise has been viewed as a craftsman , inclined to let the ( sometimes studio-assigned ) story concept set the style . Later cineastes , such as Martin Scorsese , insist that despite Wise 's legendary workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget , his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan . Wise achieved critical success as a director in a striking variety of film genres : horror , noir , western , war , science fiction , musical and drama , with many repeat successes within each genre . Wise 's meticulous preparation may have been largely motivated by studio budget constraints , but advanced the moviemaking art . Robert Wise received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998 .",
