  "/wiki/Fourth_wall": "The fourth wall is a performance convention in which an invisible , imagined wall separates actors from the audience . While the audience can see through this wall , the convention assumes , the actors act as if they can not . From the 16th century onward , the rise of illusionism in staging practices , which culminated in the realism and naturalism of the theatre of the 19th century , led to the development of the fourth wall concept . The metaphor suggests a relationship to the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne behind a proscenium arch . When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage , in what is known as a box set , the fourth of them would run along the line ( technically called the proscenium ) dividing the room from the auditorium . The fourth wall , though , is a theatrical convention , rather than of set design . The actors ignore the audience , focus their attention exclusively on the dramatic world , and remain absorbed in its fiction , in a state that the theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski called public solitude ( the ability to behave as one would in private , despite , in actuality , being watched intently while so doing , or to be 'alone in public ' ) . In this way , the fourth wall exists regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set , or the physical arrangement of the theatre building or performance space , or the actors ' distance from or proximity to the audience . [ citation needed ] Breaking the fourth wall is any instance in which this performance convention , having been adopted more generally in the drama , is violated . This can be done through either directly referring to the audience , the play as a play , or the characters ' fictionality . The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance . This act of drawing attention to a play 's performance conventions is metatheatrical .",
  "/wiki/Spider-Man": "Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko . He first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy # 15 ( August 1962 ) in the Silver Age of Comic Books . He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics , as well as in a number of movies , television shows , and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe . In the stories , Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker , an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash . Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues , and accompanied him with many supporting characters , such as J. Jonah Jameson , Harry Osborn , Max Modell , romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson , and foes such as Doctor Octopus , Green Goblin and Venom . His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider ; these include clinging to surfaces , shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices , and detecting danger with his spider-sense . When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s , teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist . The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker , a high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man 's secret identity and with whose self-obsessions with rejection , inadequacy , and loneliness young readers could relate . While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick , unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin , Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman ; he thus had to learn for himself that with great power there must also come great responsibility - a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian , the late Uncle Ben . Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series , the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man . Over the years , the Peter Parker character developed from a shy , nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student , to married high school teacher to , in the late 2000s , a single freelance photographer . In the 2010s , he joins the Avengers , Marvel 's flagship superhero team .",
