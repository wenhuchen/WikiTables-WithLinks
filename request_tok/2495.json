  "/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)": "In ice hockey , a forward is a player position on the ice whose primary responsibility is to score and assist goals . Generally , the forwards try to stay in three different lanes , also known as thirds , of the ice going from goal to goal . It is not mandatory , however , to stay in a lane . Staying in a lane aids in forming the common offensive strategy known as a triangle . One forward obtains the puck and then the forwards pass it between themselves making the goalie move side to side . This strategy opens up the net for scoring opportunities . This strategy allows for a constant flow of the play , attempting to maintain the control of play by one team in the offensive zone . The forwards can pass to the defence players playing at the blue line , thus freeing up the play and allowing either a shot from the point ( blue line position where the defence stands ) or a pass back to the offence . This then begins the triangle again . Each team has three forwards in each line :",
