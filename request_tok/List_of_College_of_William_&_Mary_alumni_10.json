He was a mathematics prodigy , but he abandoned an academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle . Between 1978 and 1995 , he killed three people and injured 23 others in an attempt to start a revolution by conducting a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology . In 1971 , Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln , Montana , where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient . He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable ; he began his bombing campaign in 1978 . In 1995 , he sent a letter to The New York Times and promised to desist from terrorism if The Times or The Washington Post published his essay Industrial Society and Its Future , in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large-scale organization . Kaczynski was the subject of the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) . Before his identity was known , the FBI used the acronym UNABOM ( University and Airline Bomber ) to refer to his case , which resulted in the media naming him the Unabomber . The FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of Industrial Society and Its Future , which led to a tip from Kaczynski 's brother David , who recognized the writing style . After his arrest in 1996 , Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted him to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty , as he did not believe that he was insane . In 1998 , a plea bargain was reached under which he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole .",
