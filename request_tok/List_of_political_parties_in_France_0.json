The name was also given to a journal associated with the movement . The movement and the journal were founded by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois in 1899 , as a nationalist reaction against the intervention of left-wing intellectuals on the behalf of Alfred Dreyfus . Charles Maurras quickly joined Action fran\u00e7aise and became its principal ideologist . Under the influence of Maurras , Action fran\u00e7aise became royalist , counter-revolutionary ( objecting to the legacy of the French Revolution ) , anti-parliamentary and pro-decentralization , and supported corporatism , Integralism and Catholicism . Shortly after it was created , Action Fran\u00e7aise tried to influence public opinion by turning its journal to a daily newspaper and by setting up various organizations . By 1914 , it had become the best structured and the most vital nationalist movement in France . In the inter-war period , the movement enjoyed prestige and influence , but its popularity gradually declined as a result of the rise of fascism and of a rupture in the relations with the Catholic Church . During the Second World War , Action fran\u00e7aise supported the Vichy Regime and Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain . After the fall of Vichy , its newspaper was banned and Maurras was sentenced to life imprisonment . The movement nevertheless continued to exist due to new publications and political movements . Although Action fran\u00e7aise is not a major force in the right as it used to be , its ideas have remained influential .",

  "/wiki/Euroscepticism": "Euroscepticism , also known as EU-scepticism , means criticism of the European Union ( EU ) and European integration . It ranges from those who oppose some EU institutions and policies and seek reform ( soft Euroscepticism ) , to those who oppose EU membership outright and see the EU as unreformable ( hard Euroscepticism or anti-European Unionism/anti-EUism ) . The opposite of Euroscepticism is known as pro-Europeanism , or European Unionism . Euroscepticism should not be confused with anti-Europeanism , which is a dislike of European culture and European ethnic groups by non-Europeans . The main sources of Euroscepticism have been beliefs that integration undermines national sovereignty and the nation state , that the EU is elitist and lacks democratic legitimacy and transparency , that it is too bureaucratic and wasteful , that it encourages high levels of migration , or perceptions that it is a neoliberal organisation serving the business elite at the expense of the working class , responsible for austerity and driving privatization . Euroscepticism is found in groups across the political spectrum , both left-wing and right-wing and is often found in populist parties . Although they criticise the EU for many of the same reasons , Eurosceptic left-wing populists focus more on economic issues ( such as the European debt crisis and TTIP ) while Eurosceptic right-wing populists focus more on nationalism and immigration ( such as the European migrant crisis ) . The rise in radical right-wing parties since the 2000s is strongly linked to a rise in Euroscepticism . Eurobarometer surveys of EU citizens show that trust in the EU and its institutions has declined strongly since a peak in 2007 . Since then , it has been consistently below 50% . A 2009 survey showed that support for EU membership was lowest in the United Kingdom ( UK ) , Latvia and Hungary . By 2016 , the countries viewing the EU most unfavourably were the UK , Greece , France and Spain .",

It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty - itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians . Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name Capetian to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet ( c. 939 - 996 ) . Contemporaries did not use the name Capetian ( see House of France ) . The Capets were sometimes called the third race of kings ( following the Merovingians and the Carolingians ) . The name Capet derives from the nickname ( of uncertain meaning ) given to Hugh , the first Capetian King , who became known as Hugh Capet . The direct line of the House of Capet came to an end in 1328 , when the three sons of Philip IV ( reigned 1285-1314 ) all failed to produce surviving male heirs to the French throne . With the death of Charles IV ( reigned 1322-1328 ) , the throne passed to the House of Valois , descended from a younger brother of Philip IV . Royal power would later pass ( 1589 ) to another Capetian branch , the House of Bourbon , descended from the youngest son of Louis IX ( reigned 1226-1270 ) , and ( from 1830 ) to a Bourbon cadet branch , the House of Orl\u00e9ans , always remaining in the hands of agnatic descendants of Hugh Capet .",

It moved away from the presidential majority in 1992 , when Brice Lalonde left the cabinet . The party , in alliance with The Greens obtained about 14% of the vote in the 1992 French regional elections ; but the 1993 legislative election was disappointing for the Green-GE alliance , as it failed to win any seats and won only 7% ( other ecologist parties brought the score up to 11% ) , when polls had given them up to 16% . No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was the movement 's vice-president from 1992 to 1994 , when he was excluded from the party and founded the Ecology-Solidarity Convergence , which later joined The Greens .

[ a ] Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view , and that women are treated unfairly within those societies . Efforts to change that include fighting gender stereotypes and seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men . Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women 's rights , including the right to vote , to hold public office , to work , to earn fair wages , equal pay and eliminate the gender pay gap , to own property , to receive education , to enter contracts , to have equal rights within marriage , and to have maternity leave . Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and social integration and to protect women and girls from rape , sexual harassment , and domestic violence . Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements . Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women 's rights , particularly in the West , where they are near-universally credited with achieving women 's suffrage , gender-neutral language , reproductive rights for women ( including access to contraceptives and abortion ) , and the right to enter into contracts and own property . Although feminist advocacy is , and has been , mainly focused on women 's rights , some feminists , including bell hooks , argue for the inclusion of men 's liberation within its aims , because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles . Feminist theory , which emerged from feminist movements , aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women 's social roles and lived experience ; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender . Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims .

Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French Revolution , but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International . The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organizationalist and insurrectionary anti-organizationalist sections . To date , the best-known examples of an anarcho-communist society ( i.e . established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon ) are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution , where anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend anarcho-communism through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921 . Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War starting in 1936 , anarcho-communism existed in most of Aragon , parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the Francoist Nationalists ( the regime that won the war ) , Nationalist allies such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and even Spanish Communist Party repression ( backed by the Soviet Union ) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist states and the Spanish Republic itself governed by the Republicans ."
