However , their relationship is complicated by the fact that Angel is himself a vampire cursed with remorse and a human soul , which motivates him to assist Buffy in her duties as Slayer . The character 's popularity led to the production of the spin-off Angel , which follows the character 's struggle towards redemption after moving to Los Angeles . In addition to the two television series , the character appears in the comic book continuations of both series , as well as much other expanded universe literature . In the character 's backstory , he was born Liam in 18th-century Ireland and , after being sired , assumed the name Angelus , achieving infamy as the most sadistic vampire in European history . After angering a Romani clan , he was cursed with his human soul , leading to great personal torment and the decision to resist the evil impulses that come with being a vampire . He later assumes the shortened name Angel , and over the course of Buffy and Angel , he matures into an altruistic champion of mankind , and learns he is a central figure of several prophecies concerning an approaching apocalypse . Angel ended its five-year run in 2004 . However , the canonical comic books Angel : After the Fall ( 2007-2009 ) , Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight ( 2007-2011 ) and Angel & Faith ( 2011-2013 ) depict the character 's continued story , in which he is caught up in events of cosmic proportion and must deal with the fallout from enormous mistakes he has made . Season two of Buffy and season four of Angel feature storylines in which , deprived of his soul , he resumes his Angelus persona and torments and kills some of his allies .",
