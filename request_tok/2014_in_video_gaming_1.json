A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units .",

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

It competed with Sony 's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo 's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles . It was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12 , 2005 , with detailed launch and game information announced later that month at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo . The Xbox 360 features an online service , Xbox Live , which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console 's lifetime . Available in free and subscription-based varieties , Xbox Live allows users to : play games online ; download games ( through Xbox Live Arcade ) and game demos ; purchase and stream music , television programs , and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals ; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications . In addition to online multimedia features , it allows users to stream media from local PCs . Several peripherals have been released , including wireless controllers , expanded hard drive storage , and the Kinect motion sensing camera . The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia , turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment . Launched worldwide across 2005-2006 , the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions , including North America and Europe . The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate , indicated by the so-called Red Ring of Death , necessitating an extension of the device 's warranty period . Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console : the Xbox 360 S in 2010 , and the Xbox 360 E in 2013 .",
  "/wiki/Out_of_the_Park_Baseball": "Out of the Park Baseball , abbreviated as OOTP , is a text-based baseball simulation for career , historical , and fictional play . OOTP was originally written in 1998 , when lead developer Markus Heinsohn sought to combine realistic replay baseball simulation with career play to satisfy hardcore fans and casual gamers alike . A friend of mine brought home a bat and a glove from a trip to Miami , so we started hitting tennis balls into the neighbor 's gardens . That was in 1991 , Heinsohn told Inside Mac Games in a July 2012 interview . We then formed a baseball club and started playing in organized baseball leagues in 1994 . In the meantime I played all sorts of baseball computer games , but there was no management-related game that I liked , so in 1998 I decided to simply develop my own game , just for fun . When it was done in 1999 , I figured it was probably good enough to earn some money with it , and that 's when it all started . Starting with OOTP 16 , the game has licenses for Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball . The license covers historical MLB teams too . The mobile version is covered by the license too , and was renamed from iOOTP Baseball to MLB Manager . In September 2013 , OOTP Developments branched out into ice hockey with the release of Franchise Hockey Manager , which features 23 leagues , including the NHL , KHL , and many others . In January 2014 , the company announced that an American football sim named Beyond the Sideline Football was in development with a release date to be announced .",
