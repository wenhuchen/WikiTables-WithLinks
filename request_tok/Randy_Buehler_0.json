  "/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_formats": "Magic : The Gathering formats are various ways in which the Magic : The Gathering collectible card game can be played . Each format provides rules for deck construction and gameplay , with many confining the pool of permitted cards to those released in a specified group of Magic card sets . The DCI , the governing body that oversees official Magic competitive play , categorizes its tournament formats into Constructed and Limited . Constructed formats require decks to be made prior to participation , with players allowed to use any tournament-legal cards they possess . Sanctioned Constructed formats include Standard , Modern , Legacy , and Vintage . Limited formats , in contrast , utilize a restricted and unknown pool of cards , usually formed by opening Magic products . Limited competition require players to select cards and build decks on the fly within the tournament itself . The primary two sanctioned Limited formats are Sealed Deck and Booster Draft . A number of other formats have been designed by Wizards of the Coast or by players for custom gameplay or reduced investment cost ; these are known as casual formats . Some casual formats utilize rules or sets of cards that differ from those used in sanctioned tournament play .",
  "/wiki/Calendar_date": "A calendar date is a reference to a particular day represented within a calendar system . The calendar date allows the specific day to be identified . The number of days between two dates may be calculated . For example , 24 February 2020 is ten days after 14 February 2020 in the Gregorian calendar . The date of a particular event depends on the observed time zone . For example , the air attack on Pearl Harbor that began at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian time on 7 December 1941 took place at 3:18 a.m. Japan Standard Time , 8 December in Japan . A particular day may be represented by a different date in another calendar as in the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar , which have been used simultaneously in different places . In most calendar systems , the date consists of three parts : the day of the month , the month , and the year . There may also be additional parts , such as the day of the week . Years are usually counted from a particular starting point , usually called the epoch , with era referring to the particular period of time ( note the different use of the terms in geology ) . The most widely used epoch is a conventional birthdate of Jesus ( which was established by Dionysius Exiguus in the sixth century ) . A date without the year may also be referred to as a date or calendar date ( such as 20 February rather than 20 February 2020 ) .",

  "/wiki/Pro_Tour_(Magic:_The_Gathering)": "The Pro Tour ( often abbreviated as PT ) is the second-highest form of competitive play ( after the World Championship ) for the Magic : The Gathering collectible card game . It consists of a series of tournaments held throughout the world , each requiring an invitation to participate . Every Pro Tour awards a total of $ 240,000 in cash prizes , with $ 50,000 going to the winner . Pro Tour competitors also receive Pro Points , the amount depending on their results . Pro Points award special benefits to players , including automatic qualification and travel awards for subsequent Pro Tours . Currently , four Pro Tours are held during a twelve-month season also known colloquially as a year . The Pro Tour was introduced in 1996 with the first event being held in New York . Over 100 such tournaments have been held since . Finishing within the Top 8 of a Pro Tour is considered to be one of the greatest accomplishments a competitive Magic player can achieve . Professional players are thus often compared by the number of Pro Tour Top 8 finishes they have made throughout their career . The most successful players on the Pro Tour are Kai Budde , who won seven Pro Tours out of ten Top 8 finishes , and Jon Finkel , who won three Pro Tours , while making it to the Top 8 sixteen times .",

Grand Prix tournaments are the main event of a minimum three-day mini-convention . The term Grand Prix can refer to either the tournament or to the entire weekend . Starting in 2019 , as part of a broader re-branding , the term MagicFest was introduced to refer to the overall event , which includes both the Grand Prix main event and a number of Side Events , which last for only a few hours and which have comparatively smaller prize pools .",
