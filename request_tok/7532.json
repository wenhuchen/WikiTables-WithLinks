  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha ( sometimes called cha-cha ) , is a dance of Cuban origin . It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s . This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo . The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers ' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps ( correctly , on the fourth count of each measure ) that characterize the dance . In the early 1950s , Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica . The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n , danzonete , and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds . Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo . To make his music more appealing to dancers , Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated . When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana , it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound cha-cha-cha . Thus , the new style came to be known as cha-cha-ch\u00e1 and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step . The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 ( one , two , three , cha-cha ) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion . For example , one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern .",
  "/wiki/Joe_Calzaghe": "Joseph William Calzaghe CBE ( /k\u00e6l\u02c8z\u00e6\u0261i/ kal-ZAH-gee ; born 23 March 1972 ) is a Welsh former professional boxer who competed from 1993 to 2008 . He held world championships in two weight classes , including the unified WBA ( Super ) , WBC , IBF , WBO , Ring magazine and lineal super-middleweight titles , and the Ring light-heavyweight title . Calzaghe is the longest-reigning super-middleweight world champion in boxing history , having held the WBO title for over 10 years and making 21 successful defences ( the most in super-middleweight history ) before moving up to light-heavyweight . As his super-middleweight and light-heavyweight reigns overlapped , he retired with the longest continual time as world champion of any active boxer at the time . He was also the first boxer to unify three of the four major world titles ( WBA , WBC , and WBO ) at super-middleweight , and was the first Ring champion in that weight class . Between 2006 and 2008 , Calzaghe was ranked by The Ring as one of the world 's top ten active boxers , pound for pound , reaching a peak ranking of third in January 2009 . He retired in February 2009 with an undefeated record , and as a reigning world champion . BoxRec currently ranks Calzaghe as the best super-middleweight of all time . Calzaghe was often referred to as the Pride of Wales or the Italian Dragon , the latter being a play on the moniker Italian Stallion and a reference to his multiple heritages ( the dragon being both a prominent Welsh emblem that appears on the Welsh flag and a figure in Sardinian myth ) . In 2007 , Calzaghe won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award , making him the first Welsh winner of this award since David Broome in 1960 .

  "/wiki/Lindy_Hop": "The Lindy Hop is an American dance which was born in Harlem , New York City , in 1928 and has evolved since then with the jazz music of that time . It was very popular during the swing era of the late 1930s and early 1940s . Lindy was a fusion of many dances that preceded it or were popular during its development but is mainly based on jazz , tap , breakaway , and Charleston . It is frequently described as a jazz dance and is a member of the swing dance family . In its development , the Lindy Hop combined elements of both partnered and solo dancing by using the movements and improvisation of African-American dances along with the formal eight-count structure of European partner dances - most clearly illustrated in the Lindy 's basic step , the swingout . In this step 's open position , each dancer is generally connected hand-to-hand ; in its closed position , leads and follows are connected as though in an embrace on one side and holding hands on the other . There was renewed interest in the dance in the 1980s from American , Swedish , and British dancers and the Lindy Hop is now represented by dancers and loosely affiliated grass-roots organizations in North America , South America , Europe , Asia , and Oceania . Lindy Hop is sometimes referred to as a street dance , referring to its improvisational and social nature . In 1932 , twelve-year-old Norma Miller did the Lindy Hop outside the Savoy Ballroom with her friends for tips . In 1935 , 15,000 people danced on Bradhurst Avenue for the second of a dance series held by the Parks Department . Between 147th and 148th street , Harlem threw itself into the Lindy hop with abandon as Sugar Hill residents watched from the bluffs along Edgecombe Avenue .",

  "/wiki/Salsa_(dance)": "Salsa is a Latin dance associated with the music genre of the same name which originated in the 1960s in New York City . Salsa is an amalgamation of Cuban dances that were popular in the ballrooms and nightclubs of Havana by the end of the 1950s ( e.g . casino , mambo and pachanga ) , as well as American jazz dances . It was primarily developed by Puerto Ricans living in New York ( Nuyoricans ) in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as Cuban , Puerto Rican , Cali Colombia , L.A. and New York styles . Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs , bars , ballrooms , restaurants , and outside , especially when part of an outdoor festival . In many styles of salsa dancing , as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping , the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes . Weight shifts cause the hips to move . Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated . Salsa generally uses music ranging from about 150 bpm ( beats per minute ) to around 250 bpm , although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160-220 bpm . The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music . The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps .",

The tango was frequently practiced in the brothels and bars of ports , where business owners employed bands to entertain their patrons with music . The tango then spread to the rest of the world .

On August 31 , 2009 , UNESCO approved a joint proposal by Argentina and Uruguay to include the tango in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists .",
  "/wiki/Viennese_Waltz": "Viennese waltz ( German : Wiener Walzer ) is a genre of ballroom dance . At least four different meanings are recognized . In the historically first sense , the name may refer to several versions of the waltz , including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing , danced to the music of Viennese waltz . What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz . It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or waltz position . The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz , danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar ( the international standard of 30 measures per minute ) , while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats ( 58-60 measures ) per minute . To this day however , in Germany , Austria , Scandinavia , and France , the words Walzer ( German ) , vals ( Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish ) , and valse ( French ) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz . The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader 's right ( natural ) or toward the leader 's left ( reverse ) , interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation . As the waltz evolved , some of the versions that were done at about the original fast tempo came to be called specifically Viennese waltz to distinguish them from the slower waltzes . In the modern ballroom dance , two versions of Viennese waltz are recognized : International Style and American Style . Today the Viennese waltz is a ballroom and partner dance that is part of the International Standard division of contemporary ballroom dance .",
