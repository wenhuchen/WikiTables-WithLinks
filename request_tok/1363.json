  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

It became the county town of the West Riding of Yorkshire and was the seat of the West Riding County Council from 1889 until 1974 , when the county and council were abolished , and of the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council from 1974 until its dissolution in 1986 .",
  "/wiki/Funicular": "A funicular ( /fju\u02d0\u02c8n\u026akj\u028al\u0259r/ ) is a type of a grade-separated fixed guideway transit system powered by a cable traction designed for steep inclines . Specifically this system is using two counterbalanced track-guided passenger cars or small trains permanently attached to the opposite ends of a single cable - which is looped over a pulley at the upper end of the track . A funicular 's two cars move in concert : as one ascends , the other descends simultaneously , an arrangement that distinguishes a funicular from other cable-guided transportation systems - e.g. , a single car inclined elevator . The term funicular derives from the Latin word funiculus , the diminutive of funis , meaning rope .",
  "/wiki/Corris_Railway": "The Corris Railway ( Welsh : Rheilffordd Corris ) is a narrow gauge preserved railway based in Corris on the border between Merionethshire ( now Gwynedd ) and Montgomeryshire ( now Powys ) in Mid-Wales . The line opened in 1859 as a horse tramway , running originally from quays on the River Dyfi at Morben and Derwenlas , skirting the town of Machynlleth and then following the Dulas Valley north to Corris and on to Aberllefenni . Branches served the slate quarries at Corris Uchaf , Aberllefenni , the isolated quarries around Ratgoed and quarries along the length of the Dulas Valley . The railway closed in 1948 , but a preservation society was formed in 1966 , initially opening a museum ; a short section of line between Corris and Maespoeth was re-opened to passengers in 2002 . The railway now operates as a tourist attraction . A new steam locomotive was built for the railway , which was delivered in 2005 . The two surviving locomotives , plus some of the original rolling stock , are preserved on the nearby Talyllyn Railway . The gauge of the railway is 2 ft 3 in ( 686 mm ) which is unusual , and was shared by only three other public railways in the United Kingdom : the Talyllyn Railway , the short-lived Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway and the Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway .",

The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 .

Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians or , informally , as Weegies . Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter , a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city . Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Glasgow 's population grew rapidly , reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 .",

It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations .

  "/wiki/Great_Western_Railway": "The Great Western Railway ( GWR ) was a British railway company that linked London with the southwest and west of England , the West Midlands , and most of Wales . It was founded in 1833 , received its enabling Act of Parliament on 31 August 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838 . It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel , who chose a broad gauge of 7 ft ( 2,134 mm ) - later slightly widened to 7 ft 1\u20444 in ( 2,140 mm ) - but , from 1854 , a series of amalgamations saw it also operate 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard-gauge trains ; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892 . The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921 , which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory , and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways . The GWR was called by some God 's Wonderful Railway and by others the Great Way Round but it was famed as the Holiday Line , taking many people to English and Bristol Channel resorts in the West Country as well as the far southwest of England such as Torquay in Devon , Minehead in Somerset , and Newquay and St Ives in Cornwall . The company 's locomotives , many of which were built in the company 's workshops at Swindon , were painted a Brunswick green colour while , for most of its existence , it used a two-tone chocolate and cream livery for its passenger coaches . Goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid-grey . Great Western trains included long-distance express services such as the Flying Dutchman , the Cornish Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express . It also operated many suburban and rural services , some operated by steam railmotors or autotrains . The company pioneered the use of larger , more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain .

The line was opened in 1865 to carry slate from the quarries at Bryn Eglwys to Tywyn , and was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by Act of Parliament to carry passengers using steam haulage . Despite severe under-investment , the line remained open , and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers . Since preservation , the railway has operated as a tourist attraction , expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages . In 1976 , an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol . In 2001 , the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary , and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place , including a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum .
