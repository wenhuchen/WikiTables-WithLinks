  "/wiki/Rugby_Europe_Women's_Championship": "In rugby union , the Women 's European Championship ( or - as it is also known - the European Nations Cup and the European Trophy ) is an international competition contested between women 's national teams who are members of Rugby Europe ( known from 1999 to 2014 as FIRA - Association of European Rugby , and FIRA before that ) . The competition has its origins in a four nation European Cup held in 1988 but did not become an official FIRA competition until 1995 . The competition has grown significantly and is some years attracts sufficient entrants for it to be divided into two Pools ( A and B ) with the eight highest ranked entrants in any year ( based on Rugby Europe rankings ) in Pool A . Since 2000 only the winner of the tournament held in between the World Cups ( every four years , as highlighted ) is officially recognised European Champions , although teams winning tournaments in other years are often unofficially also described as European Champions . This can cause some confusion , not least because the structure of the four-yearly tournament is invariably identical to the annual event . To make identification easier the competitions in the four yearly cycle are highlighted . The only major difference between the official European Championships and other tournaments is that in the latter , between 2001 and 2007 , England and France tended not to send their full strength national squads to the competition - though until 2007 they still played as England or France . This has resulted in some confusion about the status of games played by these nations - England do not consider their games to be full internationals ( or tests ) and do not award caps , whereas while France also do not give caps to their players in such matches , they do recognise the games as tests matches . FIRA and all other competing nations consider all the games to be tests . The 2009 tournament acted as Europe 's qualification tournament for the World Cup ( all entrants sending full strength squads ) , after which the test match status problem was finally resolved . From 2010 onwards it was announced that the non-Championship tournaments would be known as the European Trophy and any Six Nations entrants would officially be A sides ( though in 2010 Italy , as they had not qualified for the 2010 World Cup , entered their full strength squad ) .",
