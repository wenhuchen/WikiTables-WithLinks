  "/wiki/Bobcat": "The bobcat ( Lynx rufus ) is a medium-sized North American cat that first appeared during the Irvingtonian stage around 1.8 million years ago ( AEO ) . Containing two recognized subspecies , it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico , including most of the contiguous United States . The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas , as well as semidesert , urban edge , forest edge , and swampland environments . It remains in some of its original range , but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ( extirpation ) by coyotes and domestic animals . With a gray to brown coat , whiskered face , and black-tufted ears , the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized genus Lynx . It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx , with which it shares parts of its range , but is about twice as large as the domestic cat . It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped , stubby ( or bobbed ) tail , from which it derives its name . Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares , it hunts insects , chickens , geese and other birds , small rodents , and deer . Prey selection depends on location and habitat , season , and abundance . Like most cats , the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary , although with some overlap in home ranges . It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries , including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces . The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months .",

They typically live in largely forested areas , but do leave forests in search of food . Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food . The American black bear is the world 's most common bear species . It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as a least-concern species , due to its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined . Along with the brown bear , it is one of only two of the eight modern bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction . American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears , a behavior common to many species of bears .",
  "/wiki/Rattlesnake": "Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus of the subfamily Crotalinae ( the pit vipers ) .

The name Sistrurus is the Latinized form of the Greek word for tail rattler ( \u03a3\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 , seistrouros ) and shares its root with the ancient Egyptian musical instrument the sistrum , a type of rattle . The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies , all native to the Americas , ranging from southern Alberta , Saskatchewan , and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina . Rattlesnakes are predators that live in a wide array of habitats , hunting small animals such as birds and rodents . Rattlesnakes receive their name from the rattle located at the end of their tails , which makes a loud rattling noise when vibrated that deters predators or serves as a warning to passers-by . However , rattlesnakes fall prey to hawks , weasels , king snakes , and a variety of other species . Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as neonates , while they are still weak and immature . Large numbers of rattlesnakes are killed by humans . Rattlesnake populations in many areas are severely threatened by habitat destruction , poaching , and extermination campaigns . Rattlesnakes are the leading contributor to snakebite injuries in North America . However , rattlesnakes rarely bite unless provoked or threatened ; if treated promptly , the bites are seldom fatal .",

The land that became Quehanna Wild Area was home to Native Americans , including the Susquehannock and Iroquois , before it was purchased by the United States in 1784 . Settlers soon moved into the region and , in the 19th and early 20th centuries , the logging industry cut the virgin forests ; clearcutting and forest fires transformed the once verdant land into the Pennsylvania Desert . Pennsylvania bought this land for its state forests , and in the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps worked to improve them . In 1955 the Curtiss-Wright Corporation bought 80 square miles ( 210 km2 ) of state forest to focus on developing nuclear-powered jet engines . They named their facility Quehanna for the nearby West Branch Susquehanna River , itself named for the Susquehannocks .
