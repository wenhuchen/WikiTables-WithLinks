  "/wiki/Ability_(1878)": "Ability was a wooden ketch of 48 tons , owned by J. Breckenridge and built at William Woodward in 1878 . She ran aground at Cape Hawke , New South Wales , Australia , in 1897 .",
  "/wiki/Ketch": "A ketch is a two-masted sailboat whose mainmast is taller than the mizzen mast ( or aft-mast ) , generally in a 40-foot or bigger boat . The name ketch is derived from catch . The ketch 's main mast is usually stepped in the same position as in a sloop . Its sail-plan is similar to that of a yawl , on which the mizzen mast is smaller and set further back . The addition of headsails can makes a cutter-ketch . In New England , in the 1600s the ketch was a small coastal craft . In the 1700s it disappeared from contemporary records , apparently replaced by the schooner . A ketch rig has an advantage over a sloop downwind , and in heavy winds where it has more variety of setups than a sloop , but is less efficient than a sloop upwind . Staysails can also be hoisted between the top of the mizzen mast and base of the main mast to help downwind performance , and in heavy winds the mainsail can be dropped altogether leaving the boat stable under foresail and mizzen alone . Dropping the mainsail and operating under mizzen and foresail or even mizzen alone , leaves the central area of the boat free for working without intrusion of the mainsail boom .",

  "/wiki/Absalom_(1853)": "The Absalom was a wooden ketch that was wrecked at the Macleay River bar at Trial Bay , New South Wales in 1863 .",
  "/wiki/Trial_Bay": "Trial Bay is a broad bay on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales , Australia . The bay faces northwards and extends from Laggers Point in the east around to Grassy Head to the west , past the town of South West Rocks and the Macleay River mouth . The bay is named after the brig Trial which was shipwrecked there in 1816 . In 1820 John Oxley explored the area . He reported Port Macquarie as more favourable for settlement than Trial Bay , though Trial Bay might offer an anchorage while waiting for favourable winds to cross the bar at Port Macquarie . Trial Bay has a northerly facing and is sheltered from the predominant southerly swells . There have been various plans over the years to make it a full harbour , protected in all conditions . Its location in between other sheltered waters of Moreton Bay and Port Stephens recommended such a project . In the 1880s through to 1900s an attempt at a breakwater was made off Laggers Point . In the 1960s an oil terminal established near South West Rocks reignited interest in a harbour , but the Department of Public Works concluded the cost would not be warranted . Ships moored in the bay and delivered oil via a pipeline extending approximately 2 km to the terminal operated by Caltex . The terminal is noted as decommissioned in 2003 .",

  "/wiki/Cutter_(boat)": "A cutter is generally a small to medium-sized vessel , depending on its role and definition . Historically , it was a smallish single- or double-masted , decked sailcraft designed for speed rather than capacity . As such , it was gaff-rigged , with two or more headsails and often a bowsprit of some length , with a mast sometimes set farther back than on a sloop . While historically a workboat , as used by harbor pilots , the military , and privateers , sailing cutters today are most commonly fore-and-aft rigged private yachts . Powered cutters vary in size depending on their function , with small boats for ferrying passengers between larger craft and shore sometimes referred to as cutters , rugged smallish vessels serving the traditional role of delivering harbor pilots , and large ocean-going U.S. Coast Guard or UK Border Force ships referred to as cutters by tradition . Open oared cutters were carried aboard 18th century naval vessels and rowed by pairs of men sitting side-by-side on benches . A similar form that evolved among London watermen remains in use today in club racing .",

She was built in the United States and commissioned into the RAN in 1980 . During her career , Adelaide was part of Australian responses or contributions to the 1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat , the Iraq invasion of Kuwait , the Indonesian riots of May 1998 , the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce , the War in Afghanistan , and the United States-led invasion of Iraq . In 1997 , the frigate rescued two competitors in the 1996-97 Vend\u00e9e Globe solo , round-the-world yacht race . In 2001 , a boat carrying suspected illegal immigrants was intercepted by Adelaide ; the events of this interception became the centre of the Children overboard affair . In 2008 , Adelaide was the second ship of the class to be decommissioned , in order to offset the cost of an upgrade to the other four vessels . This ship was to be sunk off Avoca Beach , New South Wales as a dive wreck on 27 March 2010 , until an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by protest groups led to a postponement of the scuttling until additional cleanup work was completed . Despite further attempts to delay or cancel the scuttling , Adelaide was sunk off Avoca on 13 April 2011 .",

Canberra and Adelaide were paid off in 2005 and 2008 respectively , and later sunk as dive wrecks : their decommissioning was to offset the cost of a A $ 1 billion weapons and equipment upgrade to the remaining four ships . Sydney was decommissioned in late 2015 , after spending most of the year as a moored training ship . Darwin was decommissioned in late 2017 , Newcastle in June 2019 and Melbourne the last in October 2019 . The Hobart-class air-warfare destroyers progressively replaced the last four frigates from 2016 onwards .",
  "/wiki/Frigate": "A frigate ( /\u02c8fr\u026a\u0261\u0259t/ ) is a type of warship , having various sizes and roles over time . In the 17th century , a frigate was any warship built for speed and maneuverability , the description often used being frigate-built . These could be warships carrying their principal batteries of carriage-mounted guns on a single deck or on two decks ( with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel ) . The term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the line of battle , although early line-of-battle ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed . In the 18th century , frigates were full-rigged ships , that is square-rigged on all three masts , they were built for speed and handiness , had a lighter armament than a ship of the line , and were used for patrolling and escort . In the definition adopted by the British Admiralty , they were rated ships of at least 28 guns , carrying their principal armaments upon a single continuous deck - the upper deck - while ships of the line possessed two or more continuous decks bearing batteries of guns . In the late 19th century ( beginning about 1858 with the construction of prototypes by the British and French navies ) , the armoured frigate was a type of ironclad warship that for a time was the most powerful type of vessel afloat . The term frigate was used because such ships still mounted their principal armaments on a single continuous upper deck . In modern navies , frigates are used to protect other warships and merchant-marine ships , especially as anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces , underway replenishment groups , and merchant convoys . Ship classes dubbed frigates have also more closely resembled corvettes , destroyers , cruisers and even battleships . Some European navies such as the Dutch , French , German or Spanish ones use the term frigate for both their destroyers and frigates . [ citation needed ] The rank frigate captain derives from the name of this type of ship .",

  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship , often referred to as a steamer , is a type of steam-powered vessel , typically ocean-faring and seaworthy , that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move ( turn ) propellers or paddlewheels . The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s ; however , there were exceptions that came before . Steamships usually use the prefix designations of PS for paddle steamer or SS for screw steamer ( using a propeller or screw ) . As paddle steamers became less common , SS is assumed by many to stand for steamship . Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as MV for motor vessel , so it is not correct to use SS for most modern vessels . As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns , new trade routes opened up . The steamship has been described as a major driver of the first wave of trade globalization ( 1870-1913 ) and contributor to an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history .",
