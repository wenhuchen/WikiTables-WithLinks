  "/wiki/Flint": "Flint is a sedimentary cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz , categorized as the variety of chert that occurs in chalk or marly limestone . Flint was widely used historically to make stone tools and start fires . It occurs chiefly as nodules and masses in sedimentary rocks , such as chalks and limestones . Inside the nodule , flint is usually dark grey , black , green , white or brown in colour , and often has a glassy or waxy appearance . A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour , typically white and rough in texture . The nodules can often be found along streams and beaches . Flint breaks and chips into sharp-edged pieces , making it useful for knife blades and other cutting tools . The use of flint to make stone tools dates back millions of years , and flint 's extreme durability has made it possible to accurately date its use over this time . Flint is one of the primary materials used to define the Stone Age . During the Stone Age , access to flint was so important for survival that people would travel or trade to obtain flint . Flint Ridge in Ohio was an important source of flint and Native Americans extracted the flint from hundreds of quarries along the ridge . This Ohio Flint was traded across the eastern United States and has been found as far west as the Rocky Mountains and south around the Gulf of Mexico .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",

  "/wiki/Brighton": "Brighton ( /\u02c8bra\u026at\u0259n/ ) is a seaside resort in the county of East Sussex . It is a constituent part of the city of Brighton and Hove , created from the formerly separate towns of Brighton and Hove . Brighton is located on the south coast of England , positioned 47 miles ( 76 km ) south of London . Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age , Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods . The ancient settlement of Brighthelmstone was documented in the Domesday Book ( 1086 ) . The town 's importance grew in the Middle Ages as the Old Town developed , but it languished in the early modern period , affected by foreign attacks , storms , a suffering economy and a declining population . Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to London and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to France . The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses . In the Georgian era , Brighton developed as a fashionable seaside resort , encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent , later King George IV , who spent much time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion in the Regency era . Brighton continued to grow as a major centre of tourism following the arrival of the railways in 1841 , becoming a popular destination for day-trippers from London . Many of the major attractions were built in the Victorian era , including the Metropole Hotel ( now Hilton ) Grand Hotel , the West Pier , and the Brighton Palace Pier . The town continued to grow into the 20th century , expanding to incorporate more areas into the town 's boundaries before joining Hove to form the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove in 1997 , which was granted city status in 2000 .",

  "/wiki/Doric_order": "The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture ; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian . The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns . Originating in the western Dorian region of Greece , it is the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders , though still with complex details in the entablature above . The Greek Doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced , and had no base , dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood . The capital was a simple circular form , with some mouldings , under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions , but later more restrained . Above a plain architrave , the complexity comes in the frieze , where the two features originally unique to the Doric , the triglyph and guttae , are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples . In stone they are purely ornamental . The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these , and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament , as well as often using plain columns . More often they used versions of the Tuscan order , elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers , which is in effect a simplified Doric , with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards ; often earlier Greek versions were used , with wider columns and no bases to them . Since at least Vitruvius , it has been customary for writers to associate the Doric with masculine virtues ( the Ionic representing the feminine ) . It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use .",
  "/wiki/Palladian_architecture": "Palladian architecture is a European style of architecture derived from and inspired by the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio ( 1508-1580 ) . What is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of his original concepts . Palladio 's work was strongly based on the symmetry , perspective , and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans . From the 17th century Palladio 's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism . It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century . In Britain , Palladianism was briefly in vogue during the 17th century , but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the English Civil War and the imposition of austerity which followed . In the early 18th century it returned to fashion , not only in England but also , directly influenced from Britain , in Prussia . Count Francesco Algarotti may have written to Lord Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to Frederick the Great the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England , but Knobelsdorff 's opera house on the Unter den Linden boulevard , based on Campbell 's Wanstead House , had been constructed from 1741 . Later in the century , when the style was falling from favour in Europe , it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America , highlighted by examples such as Drayton Hall in South Carolina , the Redwood Library in Newport , Rhode Island , the Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York City , the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis , Maryland and Thomas Jefferson 's Monticello and Poplar Forest in Virginia . The style continued to be utilized in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings . From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world , whose champions such as Augustus Pugin , remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples , deemed it too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship . However , as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve ; its pediments , symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today .",

  "/wiki/Indo-Saracenic": "Indo-Saracenic , also known as Indo-Gothic , Mughal-Gothic , and , formerly , Hindoo Style , was a revival architectural style mostly used by British architects in India in the later 19th century , especially in public and government buildings in the British Raj , and the palaces of rulers of the princely states . It drew stylistic and decorative elements from native Indo-Islamic architecture , especially Mughal architecture , which the British regarded as the classic Indian style , and less often , Hindu temple architecture . The basic layout and structure of the buildings tended to be close to that used in contemporary buildings in other styles , such as Gothic revival and Neo-Classical , with specific Indian features and decoration added . Saracen is a term used in Europe until the 19th century referring to Muslim and/or Arabic-speaking people and regions of the Middle East and North Africa . The style drew from western depictions of Indian buildings from about 1795 , such as those by William Hodges and the Daniell duo ( William Daniell and his uncle Thomas Daniell ) . The first Indo-Saracenic building is said to be the Chepauk Palace , completed in 1768 , in present-day Chennai ( Madras ) . Bombay and Calcutta ( as they then were ) , as the main centres of the Raj administration , saw many buildings constructed in the style , although Calcutta was also a bastion of European Neo-classical architecture . Most major buildings are now classified under the Heritage buildings category as laid down by the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) , and protected . [ citation needed ] The style enjoyed a degree of popularity outside British India , where architects often mixed Islamic and European elements from various areas and periods with boldness , in the prevailing climate of eclecticism in architecture . Through architects and engineers transferred from India , the style was adopted in British Ceylon ( present-day Sri Lanka ) and the Federated Malay States ( present-day Malaysia ) . The British were also keen to transfer the style outside the Indian Empire and the British Far East to the United Kingdom itself , with several examples of Indo-Saracenic architecture going up in the country , for example at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton , and the eccentric Sezincote House in Gloucestershire . The wider European version , also popular in the Americas , is Moorish Revival architecture , which tends to use specific South Asian features less , and instead those characteristic of the Arabic-speaking countries ; Neo-Mud\u00e9jar is the equivalent style in Spain .",

He led an extravagant lifestyle that contributed to the fashions of the Regency era . He was a patron of new forms of leisure , style and taste . He commissioned John Nash to build the Royal Pavilion in Brighton and remodel Buckingham Palace , and Sir Jeffry Wyatville to rebuild Windsor Castle . George 's charm and culture earned him the title the first gentleman of England , but his dissolute way of life and poor relationships with his parents and his wife , Caroline of Brunswick , earned him the contempt of the people and dimmed the prestige of the monarchy . He excluded Caroline from the coronation and asked the government to introduce the unpopular Pains and Penalties Bill in an unsuccessful attempt to divorce her .

Since the publication of Edward Said 's Orientalism in 1978 , much academic discourse has begun to use the term Orientalism to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern , Asian , and North African societies . In Said 's analysis , the West essentializes these societies as static and undeveloped - thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied , depicted , and reproduced in service of imperial power . Implicit in this fabrication , writes Said , is the idea that Western society is developed , rational , flexible , and superior .",

  "/wiki/Cast_iron": "Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2% . Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature . The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured : white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through , grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks , and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite nodules which stop the crack from further progressing . Carbon ( C ) ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt% , and silicon ( Si ) 1-3 wt% , are the main alloying elements of cast iron . Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel . Cast iron tends to be brittle , except for malleable cast irons . With its relatively low melting point , good fluidity , castability , excellent machinability , resistance to deformation and wear resistance , cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes , machines and automotive industry parts , such as cylinder heads , cylinder blocks and gearbox cases . It is resistant to damage by oxidation . The earliest cast-iron artefacts date to the 5th century BC , and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu in China . Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare , agriculture , and architecture . During the 15th century , cast iron became utilized for cannon in Burgundy , France , and in England during the Reformation . The amounts of cast iron used for cannon required large scale production .",

  "/wiki/Chapel": "A chapel is a Christian place of prayer and worship that is usually relatively small , and is distinguished from a church . The term has several senses . Firstly , smaller spaces inside a church that have their own altar are often called chapels ; the Lady chapel is a common type of these . Secondly , a chapel is a place of worship , sometimes non-denominational , that is part of a building or complex with some other main purpose , such as a school , college , hospital , palace or large aristocratic house , castle , barracks , prison , funeral home , cemetery , airport , or a military or commercial ship . Thirdly , chapels are small places of worship , built as satellite sites by a church or monastery , for example in remote areas ; these are often called a chapel of ease . A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel . Finally , for historical reasons , chapel is also often the term used for independent or nonconformist places of worship in Great Britain - outside the established church , even where in practice they operate as a parish church . The earliest Christian places of worship are now often referred to as chapels , as they were not dedicated buildings but rather a dedicated chamber within a building . Most larger churches had one or more secondary altars which , if they occupied a distinct space , would often be called a chapel . In Russian Orthodox tradition , the chapels were built underneath city gates , where most people could visit them . The most famous example is the Iberian Chapel .

  "/wiki/Upper_class": "The upper class in modern societies is the social class composed of people who hold the highest social status , usually are the wealthiest members of society , and wield the greatest political power .

According to the latter view held by the traditional upper classes , no amount of individual wealth or fame would make a person from an undistinguished background into a member of the upper class as one must be born into a family of that class and raised in a particular manner so as to understand and share upper class values , traditions , and cultural norms .

The Composite order is essentially treated as Corinthian except for the capital , with no consistent differences to that above or below the capital . The Composite order is not found in ancient Greek architecture and until the Renaissance was not ranked as a separate order . Instead it was considered as an imperial Roman form of the Corinthian order . Though the Arch of Titus , in the forum in Rome and built in 82 AD , is sometimes cited as the first prominent surviving example of a composite order , the order was probably invented a little before Augustus 's reign , and certainly well-developed before his death , the very time when the Roman version of Corinthian was being established . With the Tuscan order , a simplified version of the Doric order , also found in ancient Roman architecture but not included by Vitruvius in his three orders , the Composite was added by Renaissance writers to make five classical orders . Sebastiano Serlio ( 1475-1554 ) published his book I Sette libri dell'architettura in 1537 in which he was the second to mention the Composite order as its own order and not just as an evolution of the Corinthian order as previously suggested by Leon Battista Alberti . Leon Battista Alberti in his De re aedificatoria ( English : On the Art of Building ) mentions the Composite order , calling it Italic .",

  "/wiki/Giant_order": "In classical architecture , a giant order , also known as colossal order , is an order whose columns or pilasters span two ( or more ) storeys . At the same time , smaller orders may feature in arcades or window and door framings within the storeys that are embraced by the giant order . The giant order as such was unknown to antiquity , although most ancient buildings using formal orders lacked upper storeys . To an extent buildings with giant orders resemble a Roman temple adapted for post-classical use , as many were ( the survivors have now usually been stripped of later filling-in ) .",
  "/wiki/Verandah": "A veranda or verandah is a roofed , open-air gallery or porch , attached to the outside of a building . A veranda is often partly enclosed by a railing and frequently extends across the front and sides of the structure . Although the form verandah is correct and very common , some authorities prefer the version without an h ( the Concise Oxford English Dictionary gives the h version as a variant and The Guardian Style Guide says veranda not verandah ) .",

  "/wiki/Corinthian_order": "The Corinthian order is the last developed of the three principal classical orders of ancient Greek and Roman architecture . The other two are the Doric order which was the earliest , followed by the Ionic order . When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance , two more orders were added to the canon : the Tuscan order and the Composite order . The Corinthian , with its offshoot the Composite , is the most ornate of the orders . This architectural style is characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls . There are many variations . The name Corinthian is derived from the ancient Greek city of Corinth , although the style had its own model in Roman practice , following precedents set by the Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus ( c. 2 AD ) . It was employed in southern Gaul at the Maison Carr\u00e9e , N\u00eemes and at the comparable Temple of Augustus and Livia [ fr ] at Vienne . Other prime examples noted by Mark Wilson Jones are the lower order of the Basilica Ulpia and the Arch of Trajan at Ancona ( both of the reign of Trajan , 98-117 AD ) , the Column of Phocas ( re-erected in Late Antiquity but 2nd century in origin ) , and the Temple of Bacchus at Baalbek ( c. 150 AD ) .",
  "/wiki/Mansard_roof": "A mansard or mansard roof ( also called a French roof or curb roof ) is a four-sided gambrel-style hip roof characterized by two slopes on each of its sides with the lower slope , punctured by dormer windows , at a steeper angle than the upper . The steep roof with windows creates an additional floor of habitable space ( a garret ) , and reduces the overall height of the roof for a given number of habitable stories . The upper slope of the roof may not be visible from street level when viewed from close proximity to the building . The earliest known example of a mansard roof is credited to Pierre Lescot on part of the Louvre built around 1550 . This roof design was popularized in the early 17th century by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart ( 1598-1666 ) , an accomplished architect of the French Baroque period . It became especially fashionable during the Second French Empire ( 1852-1870 ) of Napol\u00e9on III . Mansard in Europe ( France , Germany and elsewhere ) also means the attic or garret space itself , not just the roof shape and is often used in Europe to mean a gambrel roof .",
  "/wiki/Capital_(architecture)": "In architecture the capital ( from the Latin caput , or head ) or chapiter forms the topmost member of a column ( or a pilaster ) . It mediates between the column and the load thrusting down upon it , broadening the area of the column 's supporting surface . The capital , projecting on each side as it rises to support the abacus , joins the usually square abacus and the usually circular shaft of the column . The capital may be convex , as in the Doric order ; concave , as in the inverted bell of the Corinthian order ; or scrolling out , as in the Ionic order . These form the three principal types on which all capitals in the classical tradition are based . The Composite order established in the 16th century on a hint from the Arch of Titus , adds Ionic volutes to Corinthian acanthus leaves . From the highly visible position it occupies in all colonnaded monumental buildings , the capital is often selected for ornamentation ; and is often the clearest indicator of the architectural order . The treatment of its detail may be an indication of the building 's date .",
  "/wiki/Cupola": "In architecture , a cupola /\u02c8kju\u02d0p\u0259l\u0259/ is a relatively small , most often dome-like , tall structure on top of a building . Often used to provide a lookout or to admit light and air , it usually crowns a larger roof or dome .",
  "/wiki/Klemens_Wenzel,_Prince_von_Metternich": "Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar , Prince of Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein ( /\u02c8m\u025bt\u0259rn\u026ax/ MET-\u0259r-nikh ; German : Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar F\u00fcrst von Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein [ \u02c8kle\u02d0m\u0259ns f\u0254n \u02c8m\u025bt\u0250n\u026a\u00e7 ] ; 15 May 1773 - 11 June 1859 ) was an Austrian diplomat who was at the center of European affairs for four decades as the Austrian Empire 's foreign minister from 1809 and Chancellor from 1821 until the liberal Revolutions of 1848 forced his resignation . Born into the House of Metternich in 1773 as the son of a diplomat , Metternich received a good education at the universities of Strasbourg and Mainz . Metternich rose through key diplomatic posts , including ambassadorial roles in the Kingdom of Saxony , the Kingdom of Prussia , and especially Napoleonic France . One of his first assignments as Foreign Minister was to engineer a d\u00e9tente with France that included the marriage of Napoleon to the Austrian archduchess Marie Louise . Soon after , he engineered Austria 's entry into the War of the Sixth Coalition on the Allied side , signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau that sent Napoleon into exile and led the Austrian delegation at the Congress of Vienna that divided post-Napoleonic Europe amongst the major powers . For his service to the Austrian Empire , he was given the title of Prince in October 1813 . Under his guidance , the Metternich system of international congresses continued for another decade as Austria aligned itself with Russia and to a lesser extent Prussia . This marked the high point of Austria 's diplomatic importance and thereafter Metternich slowly slipped into the periphery of international diplomacy . At home , Metternich held the post of Chancellor of State from 1821 until 1848 under both Francis I and his son Ferdinand I . After a brief exile in London , Brighton , and Brussels that lasted until 1851 , he returned to the Viennese court , this time to offer only advice to Ferdinand 's successor , Franz Josef . Having outlived his generation of politicians , Metternich died at the age of 86 in 1859 . A traditional conservative , Metternich was keen to maintain the balance of power , in particular by resisting Russian territorial ambitions in Central Europe and lands belonging to the Ottoman Empire .",
  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order ( Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus , with the meaning of Etruscan order ) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans , the other being the composite order . It is influenced by the Doric order , but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture , the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order ( for example , the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders ) . Its classification as a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance . Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a Tuscan order , the solidest and least ornate , in his fourth book of Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici ( 1537 ) . Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius ( 1511 ) , he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic . The most rustic Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio . In its simplicity , the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order , and yet in its overall proportions , intercolumniation and simpler entablature , it follows the ratios of the Ionic . This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment . Serlio found it suitable to fortified places , such as city gates , fortresses , castles , treasuries , or where artillery and ammunition are kept , prisons , seaports and other similar structures used in war .",

  "/wiki/West_Pier": "The West Pier is a pier in Brighton , England . It was designed by Eugenius Birch and opened in 1866 . It was the first pier to be Grade I listed in Britain but has become increasingly derelict since its closure in 1975 . The pier was constructed during a boom in pleasure pier building in the 1860s , and was designed to attract tourists to Brighton . It was the town 's second pier , joining the Royal Suspension Chain Pier of 1823 . It was extended in 1893 , and a concert hall was added in 1916 . The pier reached its peak attendance during this time , with 2 million visitors between 1918 and 1919 . Its popularity began to decline after World War II , and concerts were replaced by a funfair and tearoom . A local company took ownership in 1965 , but could not meet the increased maintenance cost , and ultimately filed for bankruptcy . They could not find a suitable buyer , so the pier closed in 1975 and subsequently fell into disrepair . The West Pier Trust now owns the pier and has proposed various plans to renovate it . Some schemes have been opposed by local residents and the owners of the nearby Palace Pier , who have claimed unfair competition .",

  "/wiki/Wrought_iron": "Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon ( less than 0.08% ) content in contrast to cast iron ( 2.1% to 4% ) . It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions ( up to 2% by weight ) , which gives it a grain resembling wood that is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure . Wrought iron is tough , malleable , ductile , corrosion-resistant and easily welded . Before the development of effective methods of steelmaking and the availability of large quantities of steel , wrought iron was the most common form of malleable iron . It was given the name wrought because it was hammered , rolled or otherwise worked while hot enough to expel molten slag . [ note 1 ] The modern functional equivalent of wrought iron is mild steel , also called low-carbon steel . Neither wrought iron nor mild steel contain enough carbon to be hardenable by heating and quenching . :145 Wrought iron is highly refined , with a small amount of slag forged out into fibres . It consists of around 99.4% iron by mass . The presence of slag is beneficial for blacksmithing operations , and gives the material its unique fibrous structure . The silicate filaments of the slag also protect the iron from corrosion and diminish the effect of fatigue caused by shock and vibration . Historically , a modest amount of wrought iron was refined into steel , which was used mainly to produce swords , cutlery , chisels , axes and other edged tools as well as springs and files ."
