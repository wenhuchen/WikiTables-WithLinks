Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity ; however , some still use it as a means of transportation . Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved , sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport . Modern cross-country skiing is similar to the original form of skiing , from which all skiing disciplines evolved , including alpine skiing , ski jumping and Telemark skiing . Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward ( classic style ) or side-to-side in a skating motion ( skate skiing ) , aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow . It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes , including Northern Europe , Canada , Russia , the United States , Australia and New Zealand . Competitive cross-country skiing is one of the Nordic skiing sports . Cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship are the two components of biathlon , ski-orienteering is a form of cross-country skiing , which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks .",

  "/wiki/Athletics_(sport)": "Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running , jumping , throwing , and walking . The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field , road running , cross country running , and race walking . The results of racing events are decided by finishing position ( or time , where measured ) , while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts . The simplicity of the competitions , and the lack of a need for expensive equipment , makes athletics one of the most common types of sports in the world . Athletics is mostly an individual sport , with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes ' performances for a team score , such as cross country . Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC . The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century , and were then spread to other parts of the world . Most modern top level meetings are held under the auspices of World Athletics , the global governing body for the sport of athletics , or its member continental and national federations . The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics . The foremost international athletics meeting is the World Athletics Championships , which incorporates track and field , marathon running and race walking . Other top level competitions in athletics include the World Athletics Cross Country Championships and the World Half Marathon Championships .

  "/wiki/Ski_jumping": "Ski jumping is a winter sport in which competitors aim to achieve the longest jump after descending from a specially designed ramp on their skis . Along with jump length , competitor 's style and other factors affect the final score . Ski jumping was first contested in Norway in the late 19th century , and later spread through Europe and North America in the early 20th century . Along with cross-country skiing , it constitutes the traditional group of Nordic skiing disciplines . The ski jumping venue , commonly referred to as a hill , consists of the jumping ramp ( in-run ) , take-off table , and a landing hill . Each jump is evaluated according to the distance traveled and the style performed . The distance score is related to the construction point ( also known as the K-point ) , which is a line drawn in the landing area and serves as a target for the competitors to reach . The score of each judge evaluating the style can reach a maximum of 20 points . The jumping technique has evolved over the years , from jumps with the parallel skis with both arms pointing forwards , to the V-style , which is widely used today . Ski jumping has been included at the Winter Olympics since 1924 and at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships since 1925 . Women 's participation in the sport began in the 1990s , while the first women 's event at the Olympics has been held in 2014 .

These were also the first Olympic Games to have color telecasts , albeit partially . Certain events like the sumo wrestling and judo matches , sports huge in Japan , were tried out using Toshiba 's new colour transmission system , but only for the domestic market . History surrounding the 1964 Olympics was chronicled in the 1965 documentary film Tokyo Olympiad , directed by Kon Ichikawa . The games were scheduled for mid-October to avoid the city 's midsummer heat and humidity and the September typhoon season . The previous Olympics in Rome in 1960 started in late August and experienced hot weather .",

  "/wiki/1960_Winter_Olympics": "The 1960 Winter Olympics , officially known as the VIII Olympic Winter Games , was a winter multi-sport event held between February 18-28 , 1960 , in Squaw Valley , California , United States . Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . It was an undeveloped resort in 1955 , so from 1956 to 1960 the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of US $ 80,000,000 . It was designed to be intimate , allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues . Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events . Women 's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts . After a poll was taken indicating that only nine countries would send a bobsled team , the organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue , so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program . Cold War politics forced the IOC to debate the participation of China and Taiwan . The United States supported Taiwan while the Soviet Union stood behind China . Given the fact that the 1960 Games were to be held in America , there was concern among IOC members that the United States would not allow China or any other Communist country to participate . In 1957 , IOC president Avery Brundage , himself an American , announced that if the United States refused entry to any country recognized by the IOC , then they would revoke Squaw Valley 's invitation to host the Games and he would resign the presidency . Bowing to international pressure , the United States allowed athletes from Communist countries to participate .",
  "/wiki/1956_Summer_Olympics": "The 1956 Summer Olympics , officially known as the Games of the XVI Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event that was held in Melbourne , Victoria , Australia from 22 November to 8 December 1956 , with the exception of the equestrian events , which were held in Stockholm , Sweden in June 1956 . These Games were the first to be staged in the Southern Hemisphere and Oceania , as well as the first to be held outside Europe and North America . Melbourne is the most southerly city ever to host the Olympics . Due to the Southern Hemisphere 's seasons being different from those in the Northern Hemisphere , the 1956 Games did not take place at the usual time of year , because of the need to hold the events during the warmer weather of the host 's spring/summer ( which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere 's autumn/winter ) . The Olympic equestrian events could not be held in Melbourne due to Australia 's strict quarantine regulations , so they were held in Stockholm five months earlier . This was the second time that the Olympics were not held entirely in one country , the first being the 1920 Summer Olympics , which were held in Antwerp , Belgium , with some events taking place in Ostend , Belgium and Amsterdam , Netherlands . Despite uncertainties and various complications encountered during the preparations , the 1956 Games went ahead in Melbourne as planned and turned out to be a success . The enduring tradition of national teams parading as one during the closing ceremony was started at these Olympics . Several teams boycotted the Games in protest of the IOC 's rejection to suspend the USSR after their invasion of Hungary . The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals .",
  "/wiki/1956_Winter_Olympics": "The 1956 Winter Olympics , officially known as the VII Olympic Winter Games ( French : Les VIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver ; Italian : VII Giochi olimpici invernali ) , was a multi-sport event held in Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy , from 26 January to 5 February 1956 . Cortina , which had originally been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics , beat out Montreal , Colorado Springs and Lake Placid for the right to host the 1956 Games . The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other . The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements , but the rest of the costs for the Games had to be privately financed . Consequently , the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding . Thirty-two nations - the largest number of countries participating in the Winter Olympics until then - competed in the four sports and twenty-four events . Austrian Toni Sailer became the first person to sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics . The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games . Logistically , the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events . To remedy this , the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered . Politics did not affect the 1956 Winter Games - unlike the Summer Games in Melbourne , Australia later in the year which many nations boycotted after the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution , and the Suez War . The Cortina Olympics were the first Winter Olympics televised to a multi-national audience .",
