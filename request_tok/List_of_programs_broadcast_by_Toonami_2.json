  "/wiki/Daylight_Savings_Time": "Daylight saving time ( DST ) , also daylight savings time or daylight time ( United States and Canada ) and summer time ( United Kingdom , European Union , and others ) , is the practice of advancing clocks during warmer months so that darkness falls later each day according to the clock . A common implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in the spring ( spring forward ) and set clocks back by one hour in autumn ( fall back ) to return to standard time . In other words , there is one 23-hour day in late winter or early spring and one 25-hour day in the fall . George Hudson proposed the idea of daylight saving in 1895 . The German Empire and Austria-Hungary organized the first nationwide implementation starting on April 30 , 1916 . Many countries have used it at various times since then , particularly since the 1970s energy crisis . DST is generally not observed near the equator , where sunrise and sunset times do not vary enough to justify it . Some countries observe it only in some regions ; for example , parts of Australia observe it , while other parts do not . Only a minority of the world 's population uses DST ; Asia and Africa generally do not observe it . DST clock shifts sometimes complicate timekeeping and can disrupt travel , billing , record keeping , medical devices , heavy equipment , and sleep patterns . Computer software often adjusts clocks automatically , but policy changes by various jurisdictions of DST dates and timings may be confusing .",
