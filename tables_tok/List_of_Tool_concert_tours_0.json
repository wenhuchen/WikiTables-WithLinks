  "intro": "Grammy Award winning American metal band Tool has toured worldwide extensively. Tool has performed songs by other artists occasionally in their live sets, including Spasm and You Lied by Peach, Stranglehold by Ted Nugent, Demon Cleaner by Kyuss, No Quarter by Led Zeppelin, and Commando by The Ramones. The song Ticks & Leeches is only rarely performed live due to the immense strain on Keenan's voice. However, they have performed it at least a few times during their 2001 (Irvine, California) and 2002 tours including appearances in Sacramento, California, Tacoma, Washington, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Katowice (Poland), London (England), and Berlin (Germany), with Keenan using heavy vocal effects and distortion. [citation needed] Tool added 'Ticks & Leeches' back to the set list for the 2012 North American Winter Tour."
