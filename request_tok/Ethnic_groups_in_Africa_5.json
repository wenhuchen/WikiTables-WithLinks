It is spoken as a first language by the Amharas and as a lingua franca by other populations residing in major cities and towns of Ethiopia . The Amharic language possibly originated as result of a pidginization process with a Cushitic substratum and a Semitic superstratum to enable communication between people who spoke a mix of different languages . This pidginization of the new language had enabled the soldiers to create communication means independent of the church which used the Ge\u02bdez language . The language serves as the working language of Ethiopia , and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system . With 21,811,600 total speakers as of 2007 , including around 4,000,000 L2 speakers , Amharic is the second-most commonly spoken Semitic language in the world , after Arabic . Amharic is written left-to-right using a system that grew out of the Ge'ez script . The writing system is called Fid\u00e4l ( \u134a\u12f0\u120d ) in Ethiopian Semitic languages . Fid\u00e4l means script , alphabet , letter , or character or abugida ( \u12a0\u1261\u130a\u12f3 ) , from the first four symbols . The modern linguistic term abugida originates from the Ethiopian word . There is no agreed way of romanising Amharic into Latin script .

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic .

Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet .
