  "/wiki/Maya_Bridge_at_Yaxchilan": "The Maya Bridge at Yaxchilan was a suspension bridge believed by academics to have been built by the Maya across the Usumacinta River , Chiapas , Mexico . If so , it would have been the longest bridge discovered in the ancient world , dating from its construction by the Maya civilization in the late 7th century at Yaxchilan . It was a suspension bridge with a more or less level deck . Now an archaeological site , Yaxchilan had long been known to include an unusual raised terrace beside the river and pier in the river ; these structures were long theorized to be the remains of a bridge . The Maya City-State of Yaxchilan , founded in the 4th century , became one of the most powerful Mayan kingdoms during the Maya Classic Period . During the height of its power the kings of Yaxchilan built gleaming temples , pyramids , and luxurious palaces clustered along the grand plaza extending along the shores of the wild Usumacinta River . This broad river , now separating Mexico from Guatemala , formed a large U-shaped bend ( or oxbow ) that encompassed the city of Yaxchilan . This natural barrier protected the city from invasion from outside forces . However , the river was in a high flood stage during the six month rainy season , during this time Yaxchilan became an island due to the swiftly flowing [ citation needed ] waters of the engorged river which encompassed the city . An all-weather passage across the treacherous river was a necessity in order to gain access to the farmlands to the north of the city . To survive and operate efficiently as the seat of power , Yaxchilan required a dependable passageway to provide an uninterrupted flow of traffic across the river on a year-round basis . It has been speculated that the Maya solved this urban transportation problem by constructing a 100-meter long suspension bridge across the wild river in the late 7th century .",
  "/wiki/Simple_suspension_bridge": "A simple suspension bridge ( also rope bridge , swing bridge ( in New Zealand ) , suspended bridge , hanging bridge and catenary bridge ) is a primitive type of bridge in which the deck of the bridge lies on two parallel load-bearing cables that are anchored at either end . They have no towers or piers . The cables follow a shallow downward catenary arc which moves in response to dynamic loads on the bridge deck . The arc of the deck , and its large movement under load make them unsuitable for vehicular , or railroad , traffic . Simple suspension bridges are restricted in their use to foot traffic . For safety , they are built with stout handrail cables , supported on short piers at each end , and running parallel to the load-bearing cables . Sometime these may be the primary load-bearing element , with the deck suspended below . Simple suspension bridges are considered the most efficient , and sustainable design , in rural regions , especially for river crossings that lie in non-floodplain topography such as gorges .",

  "/wiki/Wheeling_Suspension_Bridge": "The Wheeling Suspension Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the main channel of the Ohio River at Wheeling , West Virginia . It was the largest suspension bridge in the world from 1849 until 1851 . Charles Ellet Jr. ( who also worked on the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge ) designed it and supervised construction of what became the first bridge to span a major river west of the Appalachian mountains . It linked the eastern and western section of the National Road , and became especially strategically important during the American Civil War . Litigation in the United States Supreme Court concerning its obstruction of the new high steamboat smokestacks eventually cleared the way for other bridges , especially needed by expanding railroads . Because this bridge was designed during the horse-and-buggy era , 2-ton weight limits and vehicle separation requirements now apply . The main span is 1,010 feet ( 310 m ) from tower to tower . The east tower rests on the Wheeling shore , while the west tower is on Wheeling Island . The east tower is 153.5 feet ( 46.8 m ) above the low-water level of the river , or 82 feet ( 25 m ) from the base of the masonry . The west tower is 132.75 feet ( 40.46 m ) above low water , with 69 feet ( 21 m ) of masonry . Detailed analysis of the bridge was conducted by Dr. Emory Kemp . The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 15 , 1975 .",

The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915 . Proposals for a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn were first made in the early 19th century , which eventually led to the construction of the current span designed by Washington Roebling . While construction started in 1870 , numerous controversies and the novelty of the designed construction process caused the actual construction to be prolonged over thirteen years . Since opening , the Brooklyn Bridge has undergone several reconfigurations , having carried horse-drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until 1950 . To alleviate increasing traffic flows , numerous bridges and tunnels were built to the north and south . Following gradual deterioration , the Brooklyn Bridge has been renovated several times , with major renovations in the 1950s , 1980s , and 2010s .

In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",
  "/wiki/George_Washington_Bridge": "The George Washington Bridge is a double-decked suspension bridge spanning the Hudson River , connecting the New York City borough of Manhattan with the New Jersey borough of Fort Lee . The bridge is named after George Washington , the first president of the United States . The George Washington Bridge is the world 's busiest motor vehicle bridge , carrying over 103 million vehicles per year in 2016 [ update ] . [ a ] It is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , a bi-state government agency that operates infrastructure in the Port of New York and New Jersey . The George Washington Bridge is also informally known as the GW Bridge , the GWB , the GW , or the George , and was known as the Fort Lee Bridge or Hudson River Bridge during construction . The idea of a bridge across the Hudson River was first proposed in 1906 , but it was not until 1925 that the state legislatures of New York and New Jersey voted to allow for the planning and construction of such a bridge . Construction on the George Washington Bridge started in October 1927 ; the bridge was ceremonially dedicated on October 24 , 1931 , and opened to traffic the next day . The opening of the George Washington Bridge contributed to the development of Bergen County , New Jersey , in which Fort Lee is located . The upper deck was widened from six to eight lanes in 1946 . The six-lane lower deck was constructed beneath the existing span from 1958 to 1962 because of increasing traffic flow . The George Washington Bridge is an important travel corridor within the New York metropolitan area . It has an upper level that carries four lanes in each direction and a lower level with three lanes in each direction , for a total of 14 lanes of travel .",
  "/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge": "The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate , the one-mile-wide ( 1.6 km ) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean . The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco , California - the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula - to Marin County , carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait .

It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers . The Frommer 's travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as possibly the most beautiful , certainly the most photographed , bridge in the world . At the time of its opening in 1937 , it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world , with a main span of 4,200 feet ( 1,280 m ) and a total height of 746 feet ( 227 m ) .",

  "/wiki/Verrazzano-Narrows_Bridge": "The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge ( /v\u0259r\u0259\u02c8z\u0251\u02d0no\u028a/ v\u0259r-\u0259-ZAH-noh ) ( also referred to as the Verrazzano Bridge , locally as the Verrazzano , and formerly as the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge or Narrows Bridge ) is the longest suspension bridge in the Western Hemisphere , connecting the New York City boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn . It spans the Narrows , a body of water linking the relatively enclosed Upper New York Bay with Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean , and is the only fixed crossing of the Narrows . The double-deck bridge carries 13 lanes of Interstate 278 , with seven lanes on the upper level and six on the lower level . The span is named for Giovanni da Verrazzano , the first documented European explorer to enter New York Harbor and the Hudson River in 1524 . Engineer David B. Steinman proposed a bridge across the Narrows in the late 1920s , and subsequent proposals were deferred over the next 20 years . A 1920s attempt to build a rail tunnel under the Narrows was aborted , as was another 1930s plan for vehicular tubes underneath the Narrows . Discussion of a tunnel resurfaced in the mid-1930s and early 1940s , but the plans were again denied . In the late 1940s , urban planner Robert Moses championed a bridge across the Narrows as a way to connect Staten Island with the rest of the city . Various issues delayed the start of construction until 1959 . The bridge opened on November 21 , 1964 , and a lower deck was opened in June 1969 to alleviate high levels of traffic . The New York City government began a $ 1.5 billion reconstruction of the bridge 's two decks in 2014 . The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge has a central span of 4,260 feet ( 1.30 km ; 0.81 mi ) .",

When it opened , the bridge was the longest of its type in the world ; it was not surpassed until 1998 , with the completion of the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge , and is now the eleventh-longest . The bridge spans the Humber ( an estuary formed by the rivers Trent and Ouse ) , between Barton-upon-Humber on the south bank and Hessle on the north bank , connecting the East Riding of Yorkshire with North Lincolnshire . Both sides of the bridge were in the non-metropolitan county of Humberside until its dissolution in 1996 . The bridge can be seen for miles around and from as far as Patrington in the East Riding of Yorkshire and out to sea miles off the coast . It is a Grade I listed building . By 2006 , the bridge carried an average of 120,000 vehicles per week . The toll was \u00a33.00 each way for cars ( higher for commercial vehicles ) , which made it the most expensive toll crossing in the United Kingdom . In April 2012 , the toll was halved to \u00a31.50 each way after the UK government deferred \u00a3150 million from the bridge 's outstanding debt .",

No two of these areas share the same geographical boundaries despite sharing the same name . The traditional East Riding of Yorkshire includes parts of ceremonial North Yorkshire such as Filey but not Goole , whereas both the administrative and ceremonial East Riding of Yorkshire include Goole but not those parts of North Yorkshire . Both the traditional and ceremonial East Riding include Kingston upon Hull , but the administrative East Riding does not as Kingston upon Hull is in its own unitary authority . The traditional East Riding covers a larger area than both the ceremonial and administrative East Riding . The East Riding , North Riding and West Riding were treated as three separate counties for many purposes , such as having separate quarter sessions . In 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888 , administrative counties with a county council were created on the historic boundaries . In 1974 both the Local Government Area and the Lieutenancy of the East Riding of Yorkshire were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 , being succeeded in most of the riding by the newly created Humberside which included parts of the West Riding and parts of Lincolnshire . The modern Local Government Area and the ceremonial East Riding of Yorkshire were formed in 1996 from the northern part of Humberside upon its abolition . At the 2011 Census , the population was 334,179 .
