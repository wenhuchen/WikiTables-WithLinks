Spanning 93,030 square kilometres ( 35,920 sq mi ) in the Carpathian Basin , it borders Slovakia to the north , Ukraine to the northeast , Romania to the east and southeast , Serbia to the south , Croatia and Slovenia to the southwest , and Austria to the west . With about 10 million inhabitants , Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union . The official language is Hungarian , which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world , and among the few non-Indo-European languages to be widely spoken in Europe . Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory , 58% of its population , and 32% of ethnic Hungarians .",
  "/wiki/Film": "Film , also called movie or motion picture or ( less widely ) The Seventh Art , is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty or atmosphere , by the means of recorded or programmed [ vague ] moving images , along with sound ( and more rarely ) other sensory stimulations . The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it . The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it , and is not projected ) . Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . They reflect those cultures , and , in turn , affect them . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating - or indoctrinating - citizens . The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved into position to be projected , but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears .",

It lies on the northern tip of Lake Annecy , 35 kilometers ( 22 mi ) south of Geneva . Nicknamed the Pearl of French Alps in Raoul Blanchard 's monograph describing its location between lake and mountains , the city controls the northern entrance to the lake gorge . Due to a lack of available building land between the lake and the protected Semnoz mountain , its population remained stagnant , around 50,000 inhabitants , since 1950 . However , the 2017 merger with several ex-communes extended the city population to 124,401 inhabitants , and 203,078 for its urban area , placing Annecy 6th in the region , behind Annemasse , which has 292,000 inhabitants . Switching from counts of Geneva 's dwelling in the 13th century , to counts of Savoy 's in the 14th century , the city became Savoy 's capital in 1434 during the Genevois-Nemours prerogative until 1659 . Its role increased in 1536 , during the Calvinist Reformation in Geneva , while the bishop took refuge in Annecy . Saint Francis de Sales gave Annecy its advanced Catholic citadel role known as Counter-Reformation . The annexation of Savoy merged the city to France in 1860 . Sometimes called Venice of the Alps , this idyllic and touristic representation comes from the three canals and the Thiou river lying through the old city and whose initial role was to protect the city and to empower its handicrafts . The city experienced an industrial development in the 19th century with silk manufacturing . Some of its industrial legacy remains today with the headquarters of NTN-SNR bearings , Salomon , Entremont and Dassault Aviation .",
