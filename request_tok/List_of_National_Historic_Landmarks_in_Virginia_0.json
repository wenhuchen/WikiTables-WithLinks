  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country .

African-American history starts in the 16th century , with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America , and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America . After the founding of the United States , black people continued to be enslaved , and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865 .

He died of typhoid , pneumonia or paratyphoid fever 31 days into his term ( the shortest tenure ) , becoming the first president to die in office . His death sparked a brief constitutional crisis regarding succession to the presidency , because the Constitution was unclear as to whether Vice President John Tyler should assume the office of president or merely execute the duties of the vacant office . Tyler claimed a constitutional mandate to become the new president and took the presidential oath of office , setting an important precedent for an orderly transfer of the presidency and its full powers when the previous president fails to complete the elected term . Harrison was born in Charles City County , Virginia , the son of Founding Father Benjamin Harrison V and the paternal grandfather of Benjamin Harrison , the 23rd president of the United States . He was the last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen Colonies before the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775 . During his early military career , he participated in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers , an American military victory that effectively ended the Northwest Indian War . Later , he led a military force against Tecumseh 's Confederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 , where he earned the nickname Old Tippecanoe . He was promoted to major general in the Army in the War of 1812 , and in 1813 led American infantry and cavalry at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada . Harrison began his political career in 1798 , when he was appointed Secretary of the Northwest Territory , and in 1799 he was elected as the territory 's delegate in the House of Representatives . Two years later , President John Adams named him governor of the newly established Indiana Territory , a post he held until 1812 .

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

Construction began in 447 BC when the Athenian Empire was at the peak of its power . It was completed in 438 BC , although decoration of the building continued until 432 BC . It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece , generally considered the zenith of the Doric order [ by whom ? ] . Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art . The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece , Athenian democracy and Western civilization , and one of the world 's greatest cultural monuments . To the Athenians who built it , the Parthenon and other Periclean monuments of the Acropolis were seen fundamentally as a celebration of Hellenic victory over the Persian invaders and as a thanksgiving to the gods for that victory . The Parthenon itself replaced an older temple of Athena , which historians call the Pre-Parthenon or Older Parthenon , that was destroyed in the Persian invasion of 480 BC . Like most Greek temples , the Parthenon served a practical purpose as the city treasury . For a time , it served as the treasury of the Delian League , which later became the Athenian Empire . In the final decade of the 6th century AD , the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary . After the Ottoman conquest , it was turned into a mosque in the early 1460s .",
