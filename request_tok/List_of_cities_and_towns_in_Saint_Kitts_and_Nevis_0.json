The Anglican parish church of Saint George is located within the main village of Market Shop , and Gingerland also encompasses numerous other villages such as Chicken Stone , Zetlands and Zion . Gingerland is one of the most populous parishes on Nevis , primarily because the higher parts of the parish have fertile soil and good rainfall . The parish is on the windward side of the island ( meaning that it faces into the trade winds ) . Many of the villages in Gingerland are situated at an altitude of nearly 1,000 feet ( over 300 meters ) , making them considerably cooler than coastal villages ( especially at night ) .

This town is situated on the north-west coast of St.Kitts and is the capital of Saint Anne Sandy Point Parish . It is strongly believed that the area known as Sandy Point was the original landing point for the English sea captain and explorer , Sir Thomas Warner , in 1623 . After being founded in the 1620s , the town became the commercial centre of St. Kitts and was one of the busiest ports in the region , as evidenced by the remains of the many former Dutch warehouses lining the shoreline , which once totalled over 300 . After 1727 , when the bulk of commercial activity was moved to Basseterre , the town and its port slowly diminished in importance . In 1984 , the port was closed entirely following the impact of Hurricane Klaus . Sandy Point has a population of 3,140 . The greatest evidence of the town 's former wealth can be seen in Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park . The largest fortress ever built in the Eastern Caribbean by the British , this fortress was constructed to defend the town 's port and the downhill fortress of Fort Charles ( Saint Kitts ) , which in turn was the colony 's second largest fortification . Today , Sandy Point Town is an important industrial centre , manufacturing aeronautics equipment .

The original town only survived a few weeks before it was destroyed by the Spanish , but it was re-founded in 1625 by French settlers led by Pierre D'Esnambuc . Dieppe Bay Town is the co-capital of St. John Capisterre Parish along with Saddlers . Originally the northern part of the parish was ruled by France , in the region of Capisterre de St. Christophe , of which Dieppe was the capital . The southern part of the parish was ruled by the United Kingdom , in British Saint Christopher , which had its parish capital in Saddlers . When Britain took full control of the island in 1713 , both capitals remained . The town was once home to a busy port , situated along the harbour at Dieppe . The harbour was renowned on the island due to the large coral reef formations offshore which gave it strong protection against the heavy waves which tended to prevent Atlantic coast development elsewhere . The port however , saw its functions cease after all business was shifted to Basseterre after Basseterre was made the capital of St. Kitts in 1723 . Dieppe Bay is currently a very small settlement with a very small population , however its historical significance to St. Kitts , and its former status as capital of the Capisterre region has allowed it to earn the status of town .
