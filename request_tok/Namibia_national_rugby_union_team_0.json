  "/wiki/British_and_Irish_Lions": "The British & Irish Lions is a rugby union team selected from players eligible for any of the Home Nations - the national teams of England , Scotland , Wales and Ireland . The Lions are a Test side and generally select international players , but they can pick uncapped players available to any one of the four unions . The team currently tours every four years , with these rotating among Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . The most recent series , the 2017 series against New Zealand , was drawn 1-1 ( with one match drawn ) . From 1888 onwards , combined rugby sides from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland toured the Southern Hemisphere . The first tour was a commercial venture and was undertaken without official backing . The six subsequent visits enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities , before the 1910 South Africa tour , which was the first tour representative of the four Home Unions . In 1949 the four Home Unions formally created a Tours Committee and for the first time , every player of the 1950 Lions squad had played internationally before the tour . The 1950s tours saw high win rates in provincial games , but the Test series were typically lost or drawn . The winning series in 1971 ( New Zealand ) and 1974 ( South Africa ) changed this pattern . The last tour of the amateur age took place in 1993 . The Lions have also played occasional matches in the Northern Hemisphere either as one-off exhibitions or as part of a Southern Hemisphere tour .",
