  "/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device": "An improvised explosive device ( IED ) is a bomb constructed and deployed in ways other than in conventional military action . It may be constructed of conventional military explosives , such as an artillery shell , attached to a detonating mechanism . IEDs are commonly used as roadside bombs . IEDs are generally seen in heavy terrorist actions or in asymmetric unconventional warfare by insurgent guerrillas or commando forces in a theatre of operations . In the second Iraq War , IEDs were used extensively against US-led invasion forces and by the end of 2007 they had become responsible for approximately 63% of coalition deaths in Iraq . They are also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups , and have caused over 66% of coalition casualties in the 2001-present Afghanistan War . IEDs were also used extensively by cadres of the rebel Tamil Tiger ( LTTE ) organisation against military targets in Sri Lanka .",

Automatic rifles are select-fire weapons that are capable of firing in semi-automatic and automatic firing modes ( some automatic rifles are capable of burst-fire as well ) .

Most automatic rifles are further subcategorized as battle rifles .",
  "/wiki/Grenade": "A grenade is an explosive weapon typically thrown by hand , but can also refer to projectiles shot out of grenade launchers . Generally , a grenade consists of an explosive charge , a detonating mechanism , and firing pin inside the grenade to trigger the detonating mechanism . Once the soldier throws the grenade , the safety lever releases , the striker throws the safety lever away from the grenade body as it rotates to detonate the primer . The primer explodes and ignites the fuze ( sometimes called the delay element ) . The fuze burns down to the detonator , which explodes the main charge . There are several types of grenades like the fragmentation ( frag ) , high explosive ( HE ) concussion and smoke grenades . Fragmentation grenades are probably the most common in modern armies . They are missiles designed to disperse shrapnel on detonation . The body is generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel , which will provide limited fragmentation through sharding and splintering , though in modern grenades a pre-formed fragmentation matrix inside the grenade is commonly used . The pre-formed fragmentation may be spherical , cuboid , wire or notched wire . Most anti-personnel ( AP ) grenades are designed to detonate either after a time delay or on impact . When the word grenade is used colloquially , it is generally assumed to refer to a fragmentation grenade .",
  "/wiki/Rocket-propelled_grenade": "A rocket-propelled grenade ( often abbreviated RPG ) is a shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon system that fires rockets equipped with an explosive warhead . Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier . These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor which propels the RPG towards the target and they are stabilized in flight with fins . Some types of RPG are reloadable with new rocket-propelled grenades , while others are single-use . RPGs , with some exceptions , are generally loaded from the muzzle . RPGs with high explosive anti-tank warheads ( HEAT ) are very effective against armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers ( APCs ) . However , heavily armored vehicles from the 2010s , such as main battle tanks , are generally too well armored ( with thick composite and/or reactive armor ) to be penetrated by an RPG , unless less armored sections of vehicle are exploited . Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems ( especially sights , tracks , rear and roof of turrets ) and other unarmored targets . The term rocket-propelled grenade is , strictly speaking , a backronym ; it stems from the Russian language \u0420\u041f\u0413 or \u0440\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0451\u0442 ( transliterated as ruchnoy protivotankovy granatomyot ) , meaning hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher , the name given to early Russian designs .",

Jeep 's product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles - both cross-overs and fully off-road worthy models , including one pickup truck . Previously , Jeep 's range included other pick-ups , as well as small vans , and a few roadsters . Some of Jeep 's vehicles - such as the Grand Cherokee - reach into the luxury SUV segment , a market segment the 1963 Wagoneer is considered to have started . Jeep sold 1.4 million SUVs globally in 2016 , up from 500,000 in 2008 , two-thirds of which in North America , and was Fiat-Chrysler 's best selling brand in the U.S. during the first half of 2017 . In the U.S. alone , over 2400 dealerships hold franchise rights to sell Jeep-branded vehicles , and if Jeep were spun off into a separate company , it is estimated to be worth between $ 22 and $ 33.5 billion - slightly more than all of FCA ( US ) . Prior to 1940 the term jeep had been used as U.S. Army slang for new recruits or vehicles , but the World War II jeep that went into production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military 4x4 , arguably making them the oldest four-wheel drive mass-production vehicles now known as SUVs . The Jeep became the primary light 4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Armed Forces and the Allies during World War II , as well as the postwar period . The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war . Doug Stewart noted : The spartan , cramped , and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four-wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky , can-do determination . It is the precursor of subsequent generations of military light utility vehicles such as the Humvee , and inspired the creation of civilian analogs such as the original Series I Land Rover .",

Isabela is still being regulated by the Basilan provincial government and provincial services are provided by Basilan but regional services are being provided by Zamboanga Peninsula . The Philippine Statistics Authority lists Isabela as statistically independent from Basilan . This prompted the provincial government to transfer the capital to Lamitan City . Institutionally , the military has played a major part in Isabela City 's and Basilan 's volatile history , due to the ongoing conflicts borne out of the Moro Secessionist wars of the 1970s , and more recently , by Al Qaeda backed Islamic fundamentalist groups fomenting a running gun-battle with the Philippines ' armed forces for more than a decade . Also exerting great influence in everyday life is the Roman Catholic Church and the Islamic mufti and imams , religious scholars and leaders who exercise a moral ascendancy over their respective groups . Trading and commerce are still predominantly in the hands of the East Asian ( Hokkien Chinese ) , aided more so by a recent influx of immigrants from Taiwan and by Koreans as well .",
  "/wiki/Jeepney": "Jeepneys ( Filipino : Dyipni ) , sometimes called simply jeeps ( Filipino : dyip ) , are buses and the most popular means of public transportation ubiquitous in the Philippines . They are known for their crowded seating and kitsch decorations , which have become a wide spread symbol of Philippine culture and art . A Sarao jeepney was exhibited at the Philippine pavilion at the 1964 New York World 's Fair as a national image for the Filipinos . Jeepneys were originally made from U.S. military jeeps left over from World War II . The word jeepney is likely a portmanteau word - a combination of jeep and jitney , both words common slang in the popular vernacular of the era : jitney being a popular term for an American taxicab , and a jeep a newly coined term to describe a type of military vehicle ( origin from General Purpose , or GP , hence Jeep ) . Other sources favor the far less likely explanation that it is a portmanteau of jeep and knee , because the passengers sit very close to each other . Most jeepneys are used as public utility vehicles . Some are used as personal vehicles . Jeepneys are used less often for commercial or institutional use .",

Al-Qaeda operates as a network of Islamic extremists and Salafist jihadists . The organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , the European Union , the United States , the United Kingdom , Russia , India , and various other countries ( see below ) . Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries , including the 1998 United States embassy bombings , the September 11 attacks , and the 2002 Bali bombings . The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror , which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies . The deaths of key leaders , including that of Osama bin Laden , have led al-Qaeda 's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks , to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and lone-wolf operators . Al-Qaeda characteristically employs attacks which include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of several targets . Activities which are ascribed to al-Qaeda involve the actions of those who have made a pledge of loyalty to bin Laden , or to the actions of al-Qaeda-linked individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq or Sudan . Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the removal of all foreign influences in Muslim countries . Al-Qaeda members believe that a Christian-Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam . As Salafist jihadists , members of al-Qaeda believe that the killing of non-combatants is religiously sanctioned . This belief ignores the aspects of religious scripture which forbid the murder of non-combatants and internecine fighting .",

  "/wiki/Extortion": "Extortion ( also called shakedown , and , in a legal sense incorrectly , exaction ) is obtaining benefit through coercion . In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offense ; the bulk of this article deals with such cases . Extortion is sometimes called the protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for protection from ( real or hypothetical ) threats from unspecified other parties ; though often , and almost always , such protection is simply abstinence of harm from the same party , and such is implied in the protection offer . Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime . In some jurisdictions , actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense , and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense . Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force , but additionally , in its formal definition , means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant . The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging , though neither is legally considered extortion . It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will , to another , in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences . Neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act , such as violence , merely a threat used to elicit actions , money , or property from the object of the extortion . Such threats include the filing of reports ( true or not ) of criminal behavior to the police , revelation of damaging facts ( such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position ) , etc . In law extortion can refer to political corruption , such as selling one 's office or influence peddling , [ citation needed ] but in general vocabulary the word usually first brings to mind blackmail or protection rackets . The logical connection between the corruption sense of the word and the other senses is that to demand bribes in one 's official capacity is blackmail or racketeering in essence ( that is , you need access to this resource , the government restricts access to it through my office , and I will charge you unfairly and unlawfully for such access ) .",

From 2002 until his election as pope , he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals . Prior to becoming pope , he was a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century ; he had an influence second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions as one of John Paul II 's closest confidants . He has lived in Rome since 1981 . His prolific writings generally defend traditional Catholic doctrine and values . He was originally a liberal theologian , but adopted conservative views after 1968 . During his papacy , Benedict XVI advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries ."
