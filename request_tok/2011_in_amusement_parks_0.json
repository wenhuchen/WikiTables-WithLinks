  "/wiki/Canobie_Lake_Park": "Canobie Lake Park is an amusement park in Salem , New Hampshire , located about 31 miles ( 50 km ) north of Boston . Founded as a trolley park on the shore of Canobie Lake on 1902 , the park most prominently featured botanical gardens , with few amusement rides . Three local families currently run the park , which draws visitors from throughout the New England region . Canobie Lake Park 's age and history inspired author Stephen King to use rides and elements from the park in his Joyland novel . It is one of only thirteen trolley parks still operating in the United States as of 2020 . After the automobile became the most popular mode of travel in the United States , the trolley line serving the park was closed . Attendance in the park declined until it was purchased by Patrick J. Holland . He installed a wooden roller coaster named Yankee Cannonball in 1936 , a ride which was designated as an ACE Roller Coaster Landmark by American Coaster Enthusiasts in 2013 . The park recovered , and the Canobie Corkscrew was installed in 1987 , after being relocated from the Old Chicago amusement park in Illinois . Arrow Development designed the Canobie Corkscrew , which was known at the time as the Chicago Loop . Untamed , a Euro-Fighter coaster , is the only other coaster in the park besides the Corkscrew with an inversion ."
