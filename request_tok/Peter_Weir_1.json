  "/wiki/Gallipoli_(1981_film)": "Gallipoli is a 1981 Australian war drama film directed by Peter Weir and produced by Patricia Lovell and Robert Stigwood , starring Mel Gibson and Mark Lee , about several young men from rural Western Australia who enlist in the Australian Army during the First World War . They are sent to the peninsula of Gallipoli in the Ottoman Empire ( in modern-day Turkey ) , where they take part in the Gallipoli Campaign . During the course of the movie , the young men slowly lose their innocence about the purpose of war . The climax of the movie occurs on the Anzac battlefield at Gallipoli and depicts the futile attack at the Battle of the Nek on 7 August 1915 . It modifies events for dramatic purposes and contains a number of significant historical inaccuracies . Gallipoli provides a faithful portrayal of life in Australia in the 1910s - reminiscent of Weir 's 1975 film Picnic at Hanging Rock set in 1900 - and captures the ideals and character of the Australians who joined up to fight , as well as the conditions they endured on the battlefield , although its portrayal of British forces has been criticised as inaccurate . It followed the Australian New Wave war film Breaker Morant ( 1980 ) and preceded the 5-part TV series ANZACs ( 1985 ) , and The Lighthorsemen ( 1987 ) . Recurring themes of these films include the Australian identity , such as mateship and larrikinism , the loss of innocence in war , and the continued coming of age of the Australian nation and its soldiers ( later called the ANZAC spirit ) .",
