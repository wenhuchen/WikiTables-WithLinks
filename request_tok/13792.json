Launched at the Gosport Navy Yard on 2 December 1799 , Chesapeake began her career during the Quasi-War with France and later saw service in the First Barbary War . On 22 June 1807 she was fired upon by HMS Leopard of the Royal Navy for refusing to allow a search for deserters . The event , now known as the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair , angered the American public and government and was a precipitating factor that led to the War of 1812 . As a result of the affair , Chesapeake 's commanding officer , James Barron , was court-martialed and the United States instituted the Embargo Act of 1807 against the United Kingdom . Early in the War of 1812 she made one patrol and captured five British merchant ships . She was captured by HMS Shannon shortly after sailing from Boston , Massachusetts , on 1 June 1813 .
