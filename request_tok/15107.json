  "/wiki/First_World_War": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

  "/wiki/Modern_Art": "Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s , and denotes the styles and philosophy of the art produced during that era . The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation . Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art . A tendency away from the narrative , which was characteristic for the traditional arts , toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art . More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art . Modern art begins with the heritage of painters like Vincent van Gogh , Paul C\u00e9zanne , Paul Gauguin , Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec all of whom were essential for the development of modern art . At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubists Georges Braque , Andr\u00e9 Derain , Raoul Dufy , Jean Metzinger and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with wild , multi-colored , expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism . Matisse 's two versions of The Dance signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting . It reflected Matisse 's incipient fascination with primitive art : the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism . Initially influenced by Toulouse-Lautrec , Gauguin and other late-19th-century innovators , Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on C\u00e9zanne 's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids : cube , sphere and cone . With the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon ( 1907 ) , Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes , violently painted women , reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own new Cubist inventions . Analytic cubism was jointly developed by Picasso and Georges Braque , exemplified by Violin and Candlestick , Paris , from about 1908 through 1912 .",
  "/wiki/Winckelmann": "Johann Joachim Winckelmann ( /\u02c8v\u026a\u014bk\u0259l\u02ccm\u0251\u02d0n/ ; German : [ \u02c8v\u026a\u014bkl\u0329man ] ; 9 December 1717 - 8 June 1768 ) was a German art historian and archaeologist . He was a pioneering Hellenist who first articulated the difference between Greek , Greco-Roman and Roman art . The prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology , Winckelmann was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large , systematic basis to the history of art . Many consider him the father of the discipline of art history . He was one of the first to separate Greek Art into periods , and time classifications . His would be the decisive influence on the rise of the neoclassical movement during the late 18th century . His writings influenced not only a new science of archaeology and art history but Western painting , sculpture , literature and even philosophy . Winckelmann 's History of Ancient Art ( 1764 ) was one of the first books written in German to become a classic of European literature . His subsequent influence on Lessing , Herder , Goethe , H\u00f6lderlin , Heine , Nietzsche , George , and Spengler has been provocatively called the Tyranny of Greece over Germany . Today , Humboldt University of Berlin 's Winckelmann Institute is dedicated to the study of classical archaeology . Winckelmann was homosexual , and open homoeroticism formed his writings on aesthetics . This was recognized by his contemporaries , such as Goethe .",
  "/wiki/Picasso": "Pablo Ruiz Picasso [ a ] ( UK : /\u02c8p\u00e6blo\u028a p\u026a\u02c8k\u00e6so\u028a/ , US : /\u02c8p\u0251\u02d0blo\u028a p\u026a\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0so\u028a , -\u02c8k\u00e6s-/ , Spanish : [ \u02c8pa\u03b2lo pi\u02c8kaso ] ; 25 October 1881 - 8 April 1973 ) was a Spanish painter , sculptor , printmaker , ceramicist , stage designer , poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in France . Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century , he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement , the invention of constructed sculpture , the co-invention of collage , and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore . Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon ( 1907 ) , and Guernica ( 1937 ) , a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces during the Spanish Civil War . Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years , painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence . During the first decade of the 20th century , his style changed as he experimented with different theories , techniques , and ideas . After 1906 , the Fauvist work of the slightly older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles , beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists , who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art . Picasso 's work is often categorized into periods . While the names of many of his later periods are debated , the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period ( 1901-1904 ) , the Rose Period ( 1904-1906 ) , the African-influenced Period ( 1907-1909 ) , Analytic Cubism ( 1909-1912 ) , and Synthetic Cubism ( 1912-1919 ) , also referred to as the Crystal period . Much of Picasso 's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style , and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism . His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles . Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life , Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments , and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art .",

  "/wiki/Victorian_era": "In the history of the United Kingdom , the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign , from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901 . The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine . Between 1837 and 1901 about 15 million emigrated from Great Britain , mostly to the United States , Canada , South Africa , New Zealand , and Australia .",

  "/wiki/John_Singer_Sargent": "John Singer Sargent ( /\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0rd\u0292\u0259nt/ ; January 12 , 1856 - April 14 , 1925 ) was an American expatriate artist , considered the leading portrait painter of his generation for his evocations of Edwardian-era luxury . He created roughly 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors , as well as countless sketches and charcoal drawings . His oeuvre documents worldwide travel , from Venice to the Tyrol , Corfu , the Middle East , Montana , Maine , and Florida . He was born in Florence to American parents , and trained in Paris before moving to London , living most of his life in Europe . He enjoyed international acclaim as a portrait painter . An early submission to the Paris Salon in the 1880s , his Portrait of Madame X , was intended to consolidate his position as a society painter in Paris , but instead resulted in scandal . During the next year following the scandal , Sargent departed for England where he continued a successful career as a portrait artist . From the beginning , Sargent 's work is characterized by remarkable technical facility , particularly in his ability to draw with a brush , which in later years inspired admiration as well as criticism for a supposed superficiality . His commissioned works were consistent with the grand manner of portraiture , while his informal studies and landscape paintings displayed a familiarity with Impressionism . In later life Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work , and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working en plein air . Art historians generally ignored society artists such as Sargent until the late 20th century .",
