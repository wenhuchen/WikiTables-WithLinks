  "/wiki/F-16": "The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics for the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . Designed as an air superiority day fighter , it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft . Over 4,600 aircraft have been built since production was approved in 1976 . Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force , improved versions are being built for export customers . In 1993 , General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation , which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta . The Fighting Falcon 's key features include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility , side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering , an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot , and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps to make it an agile aircraft . The F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other mission equipment . The F-16 's official name is Fighting Falcon , but Viper is commonly used by its pilots and crews , due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the Colonial Viper starfighter on Battlestar Galactica which aired at the time the F-16 entered service . In addition to active duty in the U.S. Air Force , Air Force Reserve Command , and Air National Guard units , the aircraft is also used by the USAF aerial demonstration team , the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds , and as an adversary/aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy . The F-16 has also been procured to serve in the air forces of 25 other nations . As of 2015 , it is the world 's most numerous fixed-wing aircraft in military service .",

In this capacity , it was equipped with a powerful radar and beyond-visual-range missiles , however initial aircraft produced to the F2 standard lacked radars due to development issues . The follow-up F3 standard was the definitive variant used by the RAF , as well as all Tornado ADV aircraft that were leased by the AMI and procured by the RSAF . During its service life , the Tornado ADV received several upgrade programmes which enhanced its aerial capabilities and enabled it to perform the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses ( SEAD ) mission in addition to its interceptor duties .

[ h ] Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory . The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

  "/wiki/Mirage_F1": "The Dassault Mirage F1 is a French fighter and attack aircraft designed and manufactured by Dassault Aviation . It was developed as a successor to the popular Mirage III family . During the 1960s , Dassault commenced development of what would become the Mirage F1 as a private venture , alongside the larger Mirage F2 . Work on the F1 eventually took precedence over the more costly F2 , which was cancelled during the late 1960s . The French Air Force ( Arm\u00e9e de l'Air ) took interest in the fledgling fighter to meet its requirement for an all-weather interceptor aircraft . Accordingly , initial production units were equipped with the Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV monopulse radar . During the latter half of 1974 , the Mirage F1 entered service in the French Air Force . Shortly thereafter , the type was deployed as the main interceptor of the French Air Force , a capacity which it continued to serve in until the arrival of the Mirage 2000 . It later transitioned to an aerial reconnaissance role . During June 2014 , the last French Mirage F1s was retired from service . Powered by a single SNECMA Atar 9K-50 turbojet engine , which provided about 7 tonnes-force ( 69 kN ; 15,000 lbf ) of thrust , and armed with an array of French and American-sourced armaments , the Mirage F1 has been operated as a light multipurpose fighter and has been exported to around a dozen nations . The type has seen action in a large number of armed conflicts involving several of its operators , including the Western Sahara War , the Paquisha War , the Cenepa War , the Iran-Iraq War , the Gulf War , the South African Border War , the War in Afghanistan , the Chadian-Libyan conflict , the 2011 military intervention in Libya , and the Northern Mali conflict .",

The Czech Republic is a landlocked country with a hilly landscape that covers an area of 78,866 square kilometers ( 30,450 sq mi ) with a mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate . It is a unitary parliamentary republic , with 10.7 million inhabitants . Its capital and largest city is Prague , with 1.3 million residents ; other major cities are Brno , Ostrava , Olomouc and Pilsen . The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia , Moravia , and Czech Silesia .

Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . The Protestant Bohemian Reformation of the 15th century led to the Hussite Wars , the first of many conflicts with the Catholic Church . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy .

It was designed to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen in the Swedish Air Force ( Flygvapnet ) . The Gripen has a delta wing and canard configuration with relaxed stability design and fly-by-wire flight controls . It is powered by the Volvo RM12 , and has a top speed of Mach 2 . Later aircraft are modified for NATO interoperability standards and to undertake air to air refuelling . In 1979 , the Swedish government began development studies for an aircraft capable of fighter , attack and reconnaissance missions to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen . A new design from Saab was selected and developed as the JAS 39 , first flying in 1988 . Following two crashes during flight development and subsequent alterations to the aircraft 's flight control software , the Gripen entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1996 . Upgraded variants , featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times , began entering service in 2003 . To market the aircraft internationally , Saab formed partnerships and collaborative efforts with overseas aerospace companies . One example of such efforts was Gripen International , a joint partnership between Saab and BAE Systems formed in 2001 . Gripen International was responsible for marketing the aircraft , and was heavily involved in the successful export of the type to South Africa ; the organisation was later dissolved amidst allegations of bribery being employed to secure foreign interest and sales ."
