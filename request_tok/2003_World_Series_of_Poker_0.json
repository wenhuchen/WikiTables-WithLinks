  "/wiki/Hold'em": "Texas hold 'em ( also known as Texas holdem , hold 'em , and holdem ) is one of the most popular variants of the card game of poker . Two cards , known as hole cards , are dealt face down to each player , and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages . The stages consist of a series of three cards ( the flop ) , later an additional single card ( the turn or fourth street ) , and a final card ( the river or fifth street ) . Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their two hole cards . Players have betting options to check , call , raise , or fold . Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal . The player who has the best hand and has not folded by the end of all betting rounds wins all of the money bet for the hand , known as the pot . Texas hold 'em is the H game featured in HORSE and in HOSE .",

  "/wiki/Draw_(poker)": "A poker player is drawing if they have a hand that is incomplete and needs further cards to become valuable . The hand itself is called a draw or drawing hand . For example , in seven-card stud , if four of a player 's first five cards are all spades , but the hand is otherwise weak , they are drawing to a flush . In contrast , a made hand already has value and does not necessarily need to draw to win . A made starting hand with no help can lose to an inferior starting hand with a favorable draw . If an opponent has a made hand that will beat the player 's draw , then the player is drawing dead ; even if they make their desired hand , they will lose . Not only draws benefit from additional cards ; many made hands can be improved by catching an out - and may have to in order to win .",
