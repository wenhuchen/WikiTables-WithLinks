In just over a decade , he created about 2,100 artworks , including around 860 oil paintings , most of which date from the last two years of his life . They include landscapes , still lifes , portraits and self-portraits , and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic , impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art . He was not commercially successful , and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness and poverty . Born into an upper-middle-class family , Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious , quiet , and thoughtful . As a young man he worked as an art dealer , often travelling , but became depressed after he was transferred to London . He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium . He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881 , having moved back home with his parents . His younger brother Theo supported him financially , and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter . His early works , mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers , contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work . In 1886 , he moved to Paris , where he met members of the avant-garde , including \u00c9mile Bernard and Paul Gauguin , who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility . As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes .",
