The division was created when the National League ( along with the American League ) added two expansion teams and divided into two divisions , East and West effective for the 1969 season . The National League 's geographical alignment was rather peculiar as its partitioning was really more north and south instead of east and west . Two teams in the Eastern Time Zone , the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds , were in the same division as teams on the Pacific coast . This was due to the demands of the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals , who refused to support expansion unless they were promised they would be kept together in the newly created East division . During the two-division era , from 1969 to 1993 , the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates together owned more than half of the division titles , having won a combined 15 of 25 championships during that span . They were also the only teams in the division to have won consecutive titles during that span .
