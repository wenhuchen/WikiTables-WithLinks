Originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire , it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century . It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Ya\u015bodharapura ( Khmer : \u1799\u179f\u17c4\u1792\u179a\u1794\u17bb\u179a\u17c8 , present-day Angkor ) , the capital of the Khmer Empire , as his state temple and eventual mausoleum . Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings , Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu . As the best-preserved temple at the site , it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation . The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture . It has become a symbol of Cambodia , appearing on its national flag , and it is the country 's prime attraction for visitors . Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture : the temple-mountain and the later galleried temple . It is designed to represent Mount Meru , home of the devas in Hindu mythology : within a moat more than 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) long and an outer wall 3.6 kilometres ( 2.2 mi ) long are three rectangular galleries , each raised above the next . At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers . Unlike most Angkorian temples , Angkor Wat is oriented to the west ; scholars are divided as to the significance of this . The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture , its extensive bas-reliefs , and for the numerous devatas adorning its walls .",

The city and empire flourished from approximately the 9th to the 15th centuries . The city houses the magnificent Angkor Wat , one of Cambodia 's most popular tourist attractions . The word Angkor is derived from the Sanskrit nagara ( \u0928\u0917\u0930 ) , meaning city . The Angkorian period began in AD 802 , when the Khmer Hindu monarch Jayavarman II declared himself a universal monarch and god-king , and lasted until the late 14th century , first falling under Ayutthayan suzerainty in 1351 . A Khmer rebellion against Siamese authority resulted in the 1431 sacking of Angkor by Ayutthaya , causing its population to migrate south to Longvek . The ruins of Angkor are located amid forests and farmland north of the Great Lake ( Tonl\u00e9 Sap ) and south of the Kulen Hills , near modern-day Siem Reap city ( 13\u00b024\u2032N , 103\u00b051\u2032E ) , in Siem Reap Province . The temples of the Angkor area number over one thousand , ranging in scale from nondescript piles of brick rubble scattered through rice fields to the Angkor Wat , said to be the world 's largest single religious monument . Many of the temples at Angkor have been restored , and together , they comprise the most significant site of Khmer architecture . Visitors approach two million annually , and the entire expanse , including Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom is collectively protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The popularity of the site among tourists presents multiple challenges to the preservation of the ruins .",

Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion [ note 3 ] or synthesis [ note 4 ] of various Indian cultures and traditions , [ note 5 ] with diverse roots [ note 6 ] and no founder . This Hindu synthesis started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE , after the end of the Vedic period ( 1500 to 500 BCE ) , and flourished in the medieval period , with the decline of Buddhism in India . Although Hinduism contains a broad range of philosophies , it is linked by shared concepts , recognisable rituals , cosmology , shared textual resources , and pilgrimage to sacred sites . Hindu texts are classified into \u015aruti ( heard ) and Sm\u1e5bti ( remembered ) . These texts discuss theology , philosophy , mythology , Vedic yajna , Yoga , agamic rituals , and temple building , among other topics . Major scriptures include the Vedas and the Upanishads , the Puranas , the Mahabharata , the Ramayana , and the \u0100gamas .

[ web 1 ] Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies . It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE , spreading through much of Asia . Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars : Theravada ( Pali : The School of the Elders ) and Mahayana ( Sanskrit : The Great Vehicle ) . Most Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth , either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood . Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation , the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts , and their specific teachings and practices . Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha , the Dharma and the Sangha , observance of moral precepts , monasticism , meditation , and the cultivation of the Paramitas ( perfections , or virtues ) . Theravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar and Thailand . Mahayana , which includes the traditions of Pure Land , Zen , Nichiren Buddhism , Shingon and Tiantai ( Tendai ) , is found throughout East Asia .

It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together , using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism . The symbolism and structure of a Hindu temple are rooted in Vedic traditions , deploying circles and squares . It also represents recursion and equivalence of the macrocosm and the microcosm by astronomical numbers , and by specific alignments related to the geography of the place and the presumed linkages of the deity and the patron . A temple incorporates all elements of Hindu cosmos - presenting the good , the evil and the human , as well as the elements of Hindu sense of cyclic time and the essence of life - symbolically presenting dharma , kama , artha , moksa , and karma . The spiritual principles symbolically represented in Hindu temples are given in the ancient Sanskrit texts of India ( for example , Vedas and Upanishads ) , while their structural rules are described in various ancient Sanskrit treatises on architecture ( Brhat Samhita , Vastu Sastras ) . The layout , the motifs , the plan and the building process recite ancient rituals , geometric symbolisms , and reflect beliefs and values innate within various schools of Hinduism . A Hindu temple is a spiritual destination for many Hindus , as well as landmarks around which ancient arts , community celebrations and economy have flourished . Hindu temples come in many styles , are situated in diverse locations , deploy different construction methods and are adapted to different deities and regional beliefs , yet almost all of them share certain core ideas , symbolism and themes . They are found in South Asia particularly India and Nepal , Pakistan , in southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka , Cambodia , Vietnam , and islands of Indonesia and Malaysia , and countries such as Canada , the Caribbean , Fiji , France , Guyana , Kenya , Mauritius , the Netherlands , South Africa , Suriname , Tanzania , Trinidad and Tobago , Uganda , the United Kingdom , the United States , and countries with a significant Hindu community . The current state and outer appearance of Hindu temples reflect arts , materials and designs as they evolved over two millennia ; they also reflect the effect of conflicts between Hinduism and Islam since the 12th century . The Swaminarayanan Akshardham in Robbinsville , New Jersey , United States , between the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas , was inaugurated in 2014 as one of the world 's largest Hindu temples .",

  "/wiki/Artisan": "An artisan ( from French : artisan , Italian : artigiano ) is a skilled craft worker who makes or creates material objects partly or entirely by hand . These objects may be functional or strictly decorative , for example furniture , decorative art , sculpture , clothing , jewellery , food items , household items and tools and mechanisms such as the handmade clockwork movement of a watchmaker . Artisans practice a craft and may through experience and aptitude reach the expressive levels of an artist . The adjective artisanal is often used in describing hand-processing in contrast to an industrial process , such as in the phrase artisanal mining . Thus , artisanal is sometimes used in marketing and advertising as a buzz word to describe or imply some relation with the crafting of handmade food products , such as bread , beverages or cheese . Many of these have traditionally been handmade , rural or pastoral goods but are also now commonly made on a larger scale with automated mechanization in factories and other industrial areas .

  "/wiki/Hindu": "Hindus ( Hindustani : [ \u02c8\u0266\u026andu ] ( listen ) ) are persons who regard themselves as culturally , ethnically , or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism . Historically , the term has also been used as a geographical , cultural , and later religious identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent . The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time . Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era , the term Hindu implied a geographic , ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu ( Indus ) river . By the 16th century , the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims . [ a ] [ b ] The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population , in a religious or cultural sense , is unclear . Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era , or that it may have developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars . A sense of Hindu identity and the term Hindu appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and Bengali . The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati , Kabir and Eknath used the phrase Hindu dharma ( Hinduism ) and contrasted it with Turaka dharma ( Islam ) . The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu ' in religious context in 1649 . In the 18th century , the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus , in contrast to Mohamedans for Mughals and Arabs following Islam . By the mid-19th century , colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists , Sikhs and Jains , but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term Hindu until about mid-20th century .",
  "/wiki/Christianity": "Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . Its adherents , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity , and chronicled in the New Testament . It is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea . Jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around Syria , the Levant , Europe , Anatolia , Mesopotamia , Transcaucasia , Egypt , and Ethiopia , despite initial persecution . It soon attracted gentile God-fearers , which led to a departure from Jewish customs , and , after the Fall of Jerusalem , AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism , Christianity slowly separated from Judaism . Emperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity before his death ( 337 ) , and was baptized by bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia ; Constantine decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan ( 313 ) , later convening the Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire ( 380 ) . The early history of Christianity 's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the Great Church . The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon ( 451 ) over differences in Christology , while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East-West Schism ( 1054 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome . Similarly , Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era ( 16th century ) over theological and ecclesiological disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome . Following the Age of Discovery ( 15th-17th century ) , Christianity was spread into the Americas , Oceania , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work .

  "/wiki/Candi_of_Indonesia": "A candi ( pronounced [ t\u0283andi ] ) is a Hindu or Buddhist temple in Indonesia , mostly built during the Zaman Hindu-Buddha or Hindu-Buddhist period , between the 4th and 15th centuries . The Great Dictionary of the Indonesian Language of the Language Center defines a candi as an ancient stone building used for worship , or for storing the ashes of cremated Hindu or Buddhist kings and priests . Indonesian archaeologists describe candis as sacred structures of Hindu and Buddhist heritage , used for religious rituals and ceremonies in Indonesia . However , ancient secular structures such as gates , urban ruins , pools and bathing places are often called candi too , while a shrine that specifically serves as a tomb is called a cungkup . In Hindu Balinese architecture , the term candi refers to a stone or brick structure of single-celled shrine with portico , entrance and stairs , topped with pyramidal roof and located within a pura . It is often modeled after East Javanese temples , and functions as a shrine to a certain deity . To the Balinese , a candi is not necessarily ancient , since candis continue to be ( re- ) built within these puras , such as the reconstructed temple in Alas Purwo , Banyuwangi . In contemporary Indonesian Buddhist perspective , candi also refers to a shrine , either ancient or new . Several contemporary viharas in Indonesia for example , contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples , such as the replica of Pawon and Plaosan 's perwara ( small ) temples .

They are venerated especially in Vaishnavism , which regards Vishnu or Krishna as the Supreme Being . Many modern academics place the Alvars date between 5th century to 10th century CE , however traditionally the Alvars are considered to have lived between 4200 BCE - 2700 BCE . Orthodoxy posits the number of alvars as ten , though there are other references that include Andal and Madhurakavi Alvar , making the number twelve . Andal is the only female saint-poet in the 12 Alvars . Together with the contemporary sixty three Shaiva Nayanars , they are among the most important saints from Tamil Nadu . The devotional outpourings of Alvars , composed during the early medieval period of Tamil history , helped revive the bhakti movement , through their hymns of worship to Vishnu and his avatars . They praised the Divya Desams , 108 abodes ( temples ) of these Vaishnava deities . The poetry of the Alvars echoes bhakti to God through love , and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and felicity of expressions . The collection of their hymns is known as Divya Prabandha . The Bhakti literature that sprang from Alvars has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that broke away from the ritual-oriented Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation .

  "/wiki/Jagannath": "Jagannath ( lit . 'lord of the universe ' ) is a deity worshipped in regional traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism in India and Bangladesh . Jagannath is considered a form of Vishnu . He is a part of a triad along with his brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra . To most Vaishnava Hindus , Jagannath is an abstract representation of Krishna ; to some Shaiva and Shakta Hindus , he is a symmetry-filled tantric representation of Bhairava ; to some Buddhists , he is a symbolic representation of the Buddha in the Buddha-Sangha-Dhamma triad ; to some Jains , his name and his festive rituals are derived from Jeenanath of Jainism tradition . The icon of Jagannath is a carved and decorated wooden stump with large round eyes and a symmetric face , and the icon has a conspicuous absence of hands or legs . The worship procedures , sacraments and rituals associated with Jagannath are syncretic , and include rites that are uncommon in Hinduism . Unusually , the icon is made of wood and replaced with a new one at regular intervals . The origin and evolution of Jagannath worship is unclear . Some scholars interpret hymn 10.155.3 of the Rigveda as a possible origin , but others disagree and state that it is a syncretic deity with tribal roots . His name does not appear in the traditional Dashavatara ( ten avatars ) of Vishnu , though in certain Odia literature , Jagannath has been treated as the ninth avatar , as a substitute for or the equivalent of the Shakyamuni Buddha . Jagannath is considered a non-sectarian deity .",

The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 ( Sanskrit : great-souled , venerable ) , first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa , is now used throughout the world . Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat , western India , Gandhi was trained in law at the Inner Temple , London , and called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891 . After two uncertain years in India , where he was unable to start a successful law practice , he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit . He went on to stay for 21 years . It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family , and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights . In 1915 , aged 45 , he returned to India . He set about organising peasants , farmers , and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination . Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 , Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty , expanding women 's rights , building religious and ethnic amity , ending untouchability , and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule . The same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth , or short dhoti and , in the winter , a shawl , both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel , or charkha , as a mark of identification with India 's rural poor . Thereafter , he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community , ate simple vegetarian food , and undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification and political protest . Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians , Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km ( 250 mi ) Dandi Salt March in 1930 , and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942 ."
