Discussions about Oslo hosting the Winter Olympic Games began as early as 1935 ; the city wanted to host the 1948 Games , but World War II made that impossible . Instead , Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy and Lake Placid in the United States . All of the venues were in Oslo 's metropolitan area except for the alpine skiing events , which were held at Norefjell , 113 km ( 70 mi ) from the capital . A new hotel was built for the press and dignitaries , along with three dormitories to house athletes and coaches , creating the first modern athlete 's village . The city of Oslo bore the financial burden of hosting the Games in return for the revenue they generated . The Games attracted 694 athletes representing 30 countries , who participated in four sports and 22 events . Japan and Germany made their returns to winter Olympic competition , after being forced to miss the 1948 Games in the aftermath of World War II . Germany was represented solely by West German athletes because East Germany declined to compete as a unified team . Portugal and New Zealand made their Winter Olympic debuts , and for the first time women were allowed to compete in cross-country skiing . Norwegian truck driver Hjalmar Andersen won three out of four speed skating events to become the most decorated athlete at the Games .

His successful completion of the Grand 's Exum Ridge and West Face , along with his contributions to the development of bouldering , stand among his other climbing achievements . On the 1939 American Karakoram expedition to K2 he attempted to climb K2 , the second tallest mountain in the world . He became embroiled in controversy after four members of the expedition died and the expedition leader , Fritz Wiessner , blamed Durrance . A book seeking to shed light on the event , K2 : The 1939 Tragedy , was published in 1993 . The authors , William Putnam , a former president of the Alpine Club , and Andy Kauffman , a former director , relied on a Durrance diary that surfaced for the first time fifty years after the event to place responsibility for the deaths on Wiessner . Ed Viesturs , in his book K2 : Life and Death on the World 's Most Dangerous Mountain , revisits all the available documentation and suggest instead that the unplanned decision to decommission all lower camps played a major role in the tragedy . During the 1939 climb , Durrance saved the life of Chap Cranmer who was suffering from pulmonary edema . Mr. Cranmer 's family thanked Durrance by getting him an internship with Dr. James J.
