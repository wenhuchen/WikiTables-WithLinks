  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",

  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",

  "/wiki/CB&Q_9900": "The Pioneer Zephyr is a diesel-powered trainset built by the Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad ( CB & Q ) , commonly known as the Burlington Route . The trainset was the second internal combustion powered streamliner built for mainline service in the United States , the first such train powered by a diesel engine , and the first to enter revenue service . The trainset consists of one power/RPO car , one baggage/buffet/coach car , and one coach/observation car . The cars are made of stainless steel , permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies . The construction incorporated recent advances such as shotwelding ( a specialized type of spot welding ) to join the stainless steel , and unibody construction and articulation to reduce weight . It was the first of nine similarly built trainsets made for Burlington and its technologies were pivotal in the subsequent dieselization of passenger rail service . Its operating economy , speed , and public appeal demonstrated the potential for diesel-electric powered trains to revitalize and restore profitability to passenger rail service that had suffered a catastrophic loss of business with the Great Depression . Originally named the Burlington Zephyr during its demonstration period , it became the Pioneer Zephyr as Burlington expanded its fleet of Zephyr trainsets . On May 26 , 1934 , it set a speed record for travel between Denver , Colorado , and Chicago , Illinois , when it made a 1,015.4-mile ( 1,633 km ) non-stop Dawn-to-Dusk dash in 13 hours 5 minutes at an average speed of almost 78 mph ( 124 km/h ) . For one section of the run it reached a speed of 112.5 mph ( 181 km/h ) . The historic dash inspired a 1934 film and the train 's nickname , The Silver Streak . The train entered regular revenue service on November 11 , 1934 , between Kansas City , Missouri , Omaha , Nebraska , and Lincoln , Nebraska .",

  "/wiki/Mark_Twain_Zephyr": "The Mark Twain Zephyr was an early four-unit articulated train that was similar to the Pioneer Zephyr in style . The train was built by the Budd Company and was powered by a diesel engine produced by the Winton Engine Company . The train was named Mark Twain Zephyr because it was scheduled to provide service from St. Louis , Missouri to Burlington , Iowa via Hannibal , Missouri , Twain 's hometown . The train 's exterior structure used stainless steel , and had a shovel nose front . The locomotive , number 9903 , was named Injun Joe . The three cars received other names of Mark Twain characters , Becky Thatcher , Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn . The train was christened on October 25 , 1935 in Hannibal by Nina Clemens Gabilowitsch ( 1910-1966 ) , the granddaughter and ultimately last descendant of its namesake . The ceremony was broadcast coast to coast on CBS radio . Two days later , it entered revenue service . It was retired by the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad ( CB & Q ) and then was purchased by Frank Dashner of Glenwood , Iowa in June 1960 . In June 1962 , the train was acquired by Ernie Hayes for $ 6,500 and placed on exhibit at the Midwest Old Thresher Association grounds in Mount Pleasant , Iowa . In 1972 , after many years of neglect , the train was sold to Alex Barkett of the Building Leasing Corporation , and moved to Kansas City .",

  "/wiki/CB&Q_9908": "The General Pershing Zephyr was the ninth of the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad 's Zephyr streamliners , and the last built as an integrated streamliner rather than a train hauled by an EMD E-unit diesel locomotive . It was constructed in 1939 with bodywork and passenger cars by Budd Company and diesel engine , electric transmission , power truck , and other locomotive equipment by General Motors Electro-Motive Corporation . Because its intended Kansas City , Missouri to St. Louis , Missouri route passed near the birthplace and boyhood home of famous World War I General John J. Pershing , the train was named after him . The power car was named Silver Charger , after Pershing 's horse Charger , while the passenger cars were named after U.S. Army badges of rank - Silver Leaf , Silver Eagle , and Silver Star . The train replaced the Ozark State Zephyr , which had been inaugurated three years earlier . In September , 1938 , a second trainset was added , the 9903 , which had previously served as the Mark Twain Zephyr running between Burlington , Iowa and St. Louis via Samuel Clemens ' birthplace of Hannibal , Missouri . The Ozark State service inaugurated operating out of Kansas City in the morning and St. Louis in the afternoon , with the second trainset alternating . The new equipment took over the original schedule , while the alternate timing was renamed the Mark Twain Zephyr ( despite not operating through Hannibal ) . Unlike previous Zephyrs , the General Pershing Zephyr was completely non-articulated ; each car was self-contained and joined to the next by couplers , rather than shared trucks . The inflexibility of the articulated layout had been recognised ; it was hard to lengthen , shorten , or replace parts of the train . The route did not require a high-capacity train nor a powerful locomotive , so the General Pershing Zephyr returned to the pattern of the first Pioneer Zephyr , being a power/baggage car and three trailers . Budd also fitted disc brakes , the first such practical installation to railroad passenger cars .",

  "/wiki/M-10002": "The Union Pacific Railroad 's M-10002 was a diesel-electric streamliner train built in 1936 by Pullman-Standard , with prime movers from the Winton Engine division of General Motors Corporation and General Electric generator , control equipment and traction motors . It was the UP 's third streamliner , and the last turret-cab streamliner . The original order was for two 1200 hp power cars , M-10002 and M-10003 , of the same design as M-10001 . However , the demands of Chicago-to-west-coast service led UP to expand the consists from six to nine cars and seek more power for the larger trainsets . Following the demonstration of multiple unit control systems with the EMC 1800 hp B-B units , the new technology was used to increase the power of M-10002 by adding a booster unit with the 900 hp engine that had been removed from M-10001 when it was rebuilt prior to entering regular service . The order for M-10003 was cancelled and the order number was used for one of the four more powerful locomotive sets built after M-10002 . The cab unit was fitted with a 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) V16 Winton 201-A diesel engine and booster was equipped with a 900 hp ( 670 kW ) V12 Winton 201-A engine . The cab and booster units were articulated together with a span bolster , giving them an effective wheel arrangement of B-B+B-B , but they were not articulated with the train and therefore formed the Union Pacific 's first separable diesel locomotive . The consist of nine passenger cars made it the longest streamliner trainset yet introduced . M-10002 entered service as the City of Los Angeles on May 15 , 1936 , the day after the Santa Fe Railroad introduced their first non-streamlined diesel-hauled , heavyweight Super Chief on their competing Chicago , Illinois to Los Angeles , California route . After the introduction of a full-sized train powered by the new EMC E2 locomotive as the City of Los Angeles in December 1937 , the train was withdrawn from service for approximately three months then reassigned to the City of Portland to replace the M-10001 .

  "/wiki/EMD_LWT12": "The EMD LWT12 was a power car built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division ( EMD ) in 1955 , to pull a lightweight passenger train . Both components were jointly developed by GM under the project name , Train Y , but were later marketed as the Aerotrain ( GM ) . Diesel power was provided by an EMD 567C 12-cylinder engine , which produced 1,200 hp ( 890 kW ) . Two other GM Diesel engines provided current for train-heating , lighting and air-conditioning . The LWT12 was underpowered , especially on grades , and the Santa Fe and Union Pacific Railroads were required to supply a helper unit to assist them in service . The LWT12 was essentially an EMD SW1200 switcher locomotive , suitably geared for high-speed passenger service ( 83 mph ) and wrapped in a distinctive aerodynamic shell . Its industrial styling was inspired by the hoods and grills of futuristic automobiles then on GM 's drawing boards . Originally , the EMD LWT12 was intended to be part of an inseparable set along with ten specially designed high-speed , low-cost , 40-foot ( 12.19 m ) passenger cars . These cars were built from bus bodies sourced from GM 's GMC division which were then widened by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) , had their front and rear modified and were attached to a generic undercarriage . The advantages of this design were that instead of refurbishing the whole carriage , the body mounted on the undercarriage would be scrapped in whole and a complete new modified bus body would be installed in its place with all of the different technical advances that had been developed , essentially resulting in a completely new car for a fraction of the cost . Also , all parts used by these carriages were sourced internally by GM and were also used in other products . All of this meant that initial outlay , as well as maintenance costs , were significantly lower than traditional passenger cars resulting in a situation where railroad companies could offer rail fares similar to bus fares of the time ."
