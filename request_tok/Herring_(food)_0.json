  "/wiki/Squid_ink": "Cephalopod ink is a dark-coloured ink released into water by most species of cephalopod , usually as an escape mechanism . All cephalopods , with the exception of the Nautilidae and the Cirrina ( deep-sea octopuses ) , are able to release ink . The ink is released from the ink sacs ( located between the gills ) and is dispersed more widely when its release is accompanied by a jet of water from the siphon . Its dark colour is caused by its main constituent , melanin . Each species of cephalopod produces slightly differently coloured inks ; generally , octopuses produce black ink , squid ink is blue-black , and cuttlefish ink is a shade of brown . A number of other aquatic molluscs have similar responses to attack , including the gastropod clade known as sea hares .",

  "/wiki/Bloater_(herring)": "Bloaters are a type of whole cold-smoked herring . Bloaters are salted and lightly smoked without gutting , giving a characteristic slightly gamey flavour and are particularly associated with Great Yarmouth , England . Popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries , the food is now described as rare . Bloaters are sometimes called Yarmouth bloater , or , jokingly , as a Yarmouth capon , two-eyed steak , or Billingsgate pheasant ( after the Billingsgate Fish Market in London ) . Bloaters are distinct from kippers in that bloaters are cured whole herring , while kippers are split smoked herring . Additionally , while the bloater is associated with England , kippers are associated with Scotland and the Isle of Man ( the Manx kipper ) . [ citation needed ] Bloaters are salted less and smoked for a shorter time while kippers are lightly salted and smoked overnight ; both dishes are referred to as red herring . According to George Orwell in The Road to Wigan Pier , The Emperor Charles V is said to have erected a statue to the inventor of bloaters . They are given the name bloater since they are swelled , or bloated in preparation .",
  "/wiki/English_cuisine": "English cuisine encompasses the cooking styles , traditions and recipes associated with England . It has distinctive attributes of its own , but also shares much with wider British cuisine , partly through the importation of ingredients and ideas from the Americas , China , and India during the time of the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration . Some traditional meals , such as bread and cheese , roasted and stewed meats , meat and game pies , boiled vegetables and broths , and freshwater and saltwater fish have ancient origins . The 14th-century English cookbook , the Forme of Cury , [ a ] contains recipes for these , and dates from the royal court of Richard II . English cooking has been influenced by foreign ingredients and cooking styles since the Middle Ages . Curry was introduced from the Indian subcontinent and adapted to English tastes from the eighteenth century with Hannah Glasse 's recipe for chicken currey . French cuisine influenced English recipes throughout the Victorian era . After the rationing of the Second World War , Elizabeth David 's 1950 A Book of Mediterranean Food had wide influence , bringing Italian cuisine to English homes . Her success encouraged other cookery writers to describe other styles , including Chinese and Thai cuisine . England continues to absorb culinary ideas from all over the world .",

  "/wiki/Herring": "Herring are forage fish , mostly belonging to the family Clupeidae . Herring often move in large schools around fishing banks and near the coast . The most abundant and commercially important species belong to the genus Clupea , found particularly in shallow , temperate waters of the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans , including the Baltic Sea , as well as off the west coast of South America . Three species of Clupea are recognised , and provide about 90% of all herrings captured in fisheries . Most abundant of all is the Atlantic herring , providing over half of all herring capture . Fishes called herring are also found in the Arabian Sea , Indian Ocean , and Bay of Bengal . Herring played a pivotal role in the history of marine fisheries in Europe , and early in the 20th century , their study was fundamental to the evolution of fisheries science .

This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food , such as the Japanese bunching onion ( Allium fistulosum ) , the tree onion ( A . \u00d7proliferum ) , and the Canada onion ( Allium canadense ) . The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species , but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation . Its ancestral wild original form is not known , although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions . The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant , but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season . The onion plant has a fan of hollow , bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached . The bulbs are composed of shortened , compressed , underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale ( leaves ) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem . In the autumn ( or in spring , in the case of overwintering onions ) , the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle . The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage . The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases , particularly the onion fly , the onion eelworm , and various fungi cause rotting .",
  "/wiki/Salt": "Salt is a mineral consisting primarily of sodium chloride ( NaCl ) , a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts ; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite . Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater , where it is the main mineral constituent . The open ocean has about 35 grams ( 1.2 oz ) of solids per liter of sea water , a salinity of 3.5% . Salt is essential for life in general , and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes . Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings , and salting is an important method of food preservation . Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 BC , when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts ; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period . Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews , the Greeks , the Romans , the Byzantines , the Hittites , Egyptians , and the Indians . Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea , along specially built salt roads , and across the Sahara on camel caravans . The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues . Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance . Salt is processed from salt mines , and by the evaporation of seawater ( sea salt ) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools . Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine ; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride , plastics , paper pulp and many other products .",

The cuisine is diverse , with Northern and Eastern European , Caucasian , Central Asian , Siberian , and East Asian influences . Russian cuisine derives its varied character from the vast and multi-ethnic expanse of Russia . Its foundations were laid by the peasant food of the rural population in an often harsh climate , with a combination of plentiful fish , pork , poultry , caviar , mushrooms , berries , and honey . Crops of rye , wheat , barley and millet provided the ingredients for a plethora of breads , pancakes , pies , cereals , beer and vodka . Soups and stews are centered on seasonal or storable produce , fish and meats . Such food remained the staple for the vast majority of Russians well into the 20th century . Soviet cuisine had a separate character of its own . The 16th through 18th centuries brought more refined culinary techniques . It was during this time period that smoked meats and fish , pastry cooking , salads and green vegetables , chocolate , ice cream , wines , and juice were imported from abroad .

The three Baltic states were the first to declare their independence , between March and May 1990 , claiming continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940 . The remaining 12 republics all subsequently seceded . 12 of the 15 states , excluding the Baltic states , initially formed the CIS and most joined CSTO , while the Baltic states focused on European Union and NATO membership . Several disputed states with varying degrees of recognition exist within the territory of the former Soviet Union : Transnistria in eastern Moldova , Abkhazia and South Ossetia in northern Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh in southwestern Azerbaijan . Since 2014 , the Donetsk People 's Republic and Luhansk People 's Republic in far eastern Ukraine have claimed independence .

Among the well-known Polish national dishes are bigos [ \u02c8bi\u0261\u0254s ] ; pierogi [ p\u02b2\u025b\u02c8r\u0254\u0261\u02b2i ] ; kie\u0142basa ; pork loin kotlet schabowy breaded cutlet [ \u02c8k\u0254tl\u025bt sxa\u02c8b\u0254v\u0268 ] ; go\u0142\u0105bki cabbage roll [ \u0261\u0254\u02c8w\u0254\u0303pk\u02b2i ] ; zrazy roulade [ \u02c8zraz\u0268 ] ; sour cucumber soup ( zupa og\u00f3rkowa ) [ \u02c8zupa \u0254\u0261ur\u02c8k\u0254va ] ; mushroom soup , ( zupa grzybowa ) [ \u02c8zupa \u0261\u0290\u0268\u02c8b\u0254va ] ; tomato soup ( zupa pomidorowa ) [ \u02c8zupa p\u0254mid\u0254\u02c8r\u0254va ] ; ros\u00f3\u0142 meat broth [ \u02c8r\u0254suw ] ; \u017curek sour rye soup [ \u02c8\u0290ur\u025bk ] ; flaki tripe soup [ \u02c8flak\u02b2i ] ; and red beetroot barszcz [ bar\u0282t\u0361\u0282 ] .

  "/wiki/Pickled_herring": "Pickled herring is a traditional way of preserving herring as food by pickling or curing . Most cured herring uses a two-step curing process . Initially herring is cured with salt to extract water . The second stage involves removing the salt and adding the herring to a brine - typically a vinegar , salt , sugar solution - to which ingredients such as peppercorn , bay leaves and raw onions are added . Additional flavourings may also be used , including sherry , mustard and dill , while other non-traditional ingredients have also begun being included in recent years . Pickled herring remains a popular food and/or ingredient to dishes in many parts of Europe including Scandinavia , the Baltic , Eastern and Central Europe , as well as the Netherlands . It is also associated with Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine , becoming a staple at kiddushes and social gatherings . Pickled herring is one of the twelve dishes traditionally served at Christmas Eve in Poland , Lithuania , and Ukraine . Pickled herring is also eaten at the stroke of midnight on New Year 's Eve to symbolize a prosperous New Year in Poland , the Czech Republic , Germany , and parts of Scandinavia .",
  "/wiki/Wigilia": "Wigilia ( Polish pronunciation : [ vi\u02c8\u0261il\u02b2a ] ) is the traditional Christmas Eve vigil supper in Poland , held on December 24 . The term is often applied to the whole of Christmas Eve , extending further to Pasterka - midnight Mass , held in Roman Catholic churches all over Poland and in Polish communities worldwide at or before midnight .

  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis ) .",
  "/wiki/Gwamegi": "Gwamegi is a Korean half-dried Pacific herring or Pacific saury made during winter .
