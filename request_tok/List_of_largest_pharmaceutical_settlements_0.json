  "/wiki/Medicaid_Drug_Rebate_Program": "The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is a program in the United States that was created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ( OBRA'90 ) . It requires that drug manufacturers have a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) in order for states to receive Federal Medicaid coverage of their products . In 2007 , 550 pharmaceutics companies participated in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and 49 states in addition to the District of Columbia supply drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program . In order for manufacturers to be eligible for Medicaid coverage a rebate agreement must be signed with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) . Section 606 of the Medicare , Medicaid , and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 ( BBRA ) amended Section 1927 ( a ) ( 1 ) allowing states to have the option of different rebate effective dates . This section states that agreements to the rebate program that have been entered on or after November 29 , 1999 may go into effect that day , and states option , any date after up to the first day of the quarter . At the time the law was enacted , managed care organizations were excluded from access to the drug rebate program . In 1990 , only 2.8 million people were enrolled in Medicaid managed care and so the savings lost by the exemption were relatively small . Today , 21 million people are enrolled in capitated managed care plans . The Drug Rebate Equalization Act of 2009 ( DRE ) , introduced in the 111th United States Congress by Representative Bart Stupak as H.R . 904 , and in the Senate by Senator Jeff Bingaman as S. 547 , would equalize the treatment of prescription drug discounts between Medicaid managed care and Medicaid fee-for-service . In offering Medicaid managed care plans access to the Medicaid drug rebate , this policy is seen as a way to provide relief for federal and state budgets , thereby mitigating the need for added cuts to Medicaid benefits or populations , and for drug carve outs , which negatively impact clinical care for Medicaid enrollees .",
  "/wiki/Rosiglitazone": "Rosiglitazone ( trade name Avandia ) is an antidiabetic drug in the thiazolidinedione class . It works as an insulin sensitizer , by binding to the PPAR in fat cells and making the cells more responsive to insulin . It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) as a stand-alone drug or for use in combination with metformin or with glimepiride . First released in 1999 , annual sales peaked at approximately $ 2.5-billion in 2006 ; however , following a meta-analysis in 2007 that linked the drug 's use to an increased risk of heart attack , sales plummeted to just $ 9.5-million in 2012 . The drug 's patent expired in 2012 . It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 1999 . Despite rosiglitazone 's effectiveness at decreasing blood sugar in type 2 diabetes mellitus , its use decreased dramatically as studies showed apparent associations with increased risks of heart attacks and death . Adverse effects alleged to be caused by rosiglitazone were the subject of over 13,000 lawsuits against GSK ; as of July 2010 , GSK had agreed to settlements on more than 11,500 of these suits . Some reviewers recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market , but an FDA panel disagreed , and it remains available in the U.S. From November 2011 until November 2013 , the federal government did not allow Avandia to be sold without a prescription from a certified doctor ; moreover , patients were required to be informed of the risks associated with its use , and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies . In 2013 , the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of a 2009 trial which failed to show increased heart attack risk . In Europe , the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) recommended in September 2010 that the drug be suspended because the benefits no longer outweighed the risks . It was withdrawn from the market in the UK , Spain and India in 2010 , and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011 .",
  "/wiki/Bupropion": "Bupropion , sold under the brand names Wellbutrin and Zyban among others , is a medication primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and to support stopping smoking . It is an effective antidepressant on its own , but is also used as an add-on medication in cases of incomplete response to first-line SSRI antidepressants . Bupropion is taken in tablet form and is available only by prescription in most countries . Common side effects include dry mouth , trouble sleeping , agitation , and headaches . Serious side effects include an increased risk for epileptic seizures and suicide . The risk of seizures caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then the recommended dose to be reduced . In comparison to some other antidepressants , it does not cause as much sexual dysfunction or sleepiness , and may result in weight loss . It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe . Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant . It acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor ( NDRI ) and a nicotinic receptor antagonist .

The act has been amended many times , most recently to add requirements about bioterrorism preparations . The introduction of this act was influenced by the death of more than 100 patients due to a sulfanilamide medication where diethylene glycol was used to dissolve the drug and make a liquid form ( see elixir sulfanilamide disaster ) .

Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service , a lack of viable substitute goods , and the possibility of a high monopoly price well above the seller 's marginal cost that leads to a high monopoly profit . The verb monopolise or monopolize refers to the process by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors . In economics , a monopoly is a single seller . In law , a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power , that is , the power to charge overly high prices .
