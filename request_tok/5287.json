Ghostbusters was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects . There was concern about the budget it would require , and little faith in its potential for box office success . On an approximate $ 25-30 million budget , filming took place between October 1983 to January 1984 , on location in New York City and Los Angeles , and on sets at Burbank Studios , Los Angeles .
