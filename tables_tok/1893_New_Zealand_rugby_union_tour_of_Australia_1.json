Ten matches were played against regional and district sides, but no Test matches were played. It was first tour arranged by New Zealand Rugby Football Union which was founded the year before. The only previous New Zealand national team was the side that toured New South Wales in 1884. Immediately before departing for Sydney, the tourists played a match against a Combined XV in Wellington, which New Zealand won 7-4."
