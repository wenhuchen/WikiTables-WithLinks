The lieutenant governor decides all questions of parliamentary procedure in the Senate . He or she also has broad discretion in following Senate procedural rules . The lieutenant governor is an ex officio member of several statutory bodies . These include the Legislative Budget Board , the Legislative Council , the Legislative Audit Committee , the Legislative Board and Legislative Council , which have considerable sway over state programs , the budget and policy .

In the case of a vacancy in the lieutenant governor 's office , the Senate elects one of its members to act as President of the Senate until the next statewide office election , in effect becoming the lieutenant governor . A senator elected as presiding officer in this way retains his district seat and the voting privileges entailed with his Senate election .",

Both civil and criminal cases are filed in the district court , which is a court of law , equity , and admiralty .

Most decisions of district courts may be appealed to the respective court of appeals of their circuit , with a small number instead being appealable to the Federal Circuit , or directly to the Supreme Court . In contrast to the Supreme Court , which was established by Article III of the Constitution , the district courts were established by Congress . [ note 1 ] There is no constitutional requirement that district courts exist at all . Indeed , after the ratification of the Constitution , some opponents of a strong federal judiciary urged that , outside jurisdictions under direct federal control , like Washington , D.C. , and the territories , the federal court system be limited to the Supreme Court , which would hear appeals from state courts . This view did not prevail , however , and the first Congress created the district court system that is still in place today . There is at least one judicial district for each state , the District of Columbia , and Puerto Rico . The territories ( insular areas ) of Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , and the United States Virgin Islands each have one territorial court ; these courts are called district courts and exercise the same jurisdiction as district courts , but differ from district courts in that territorial courts are Article IV courts , with judges who serve ten-year terms rather than the lifetime tenure of judges of Article III courts , such as the district court judges .
