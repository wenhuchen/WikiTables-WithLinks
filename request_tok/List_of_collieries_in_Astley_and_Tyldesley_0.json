It was the last colliery to be sunk in Astley . Sinking commenced in 1908 by the Pilkington Colliery Company , a subsidiary of the Clifton and Kersley Coal Company , at the southern edge of the Manchester Coalfield , working the Middle Coal Measures where they dipped under the Permian age rocks under Chat Moss . The colliery was north of the Bridgewater Canal . In 1929 it became part of Manchester Collieries , and in 1947 was nationalised and integrated into the National Coal Board . It closed in 1970 , and is now Astley Green Colliery Museum .",
  "/wiki/Astley,_Greater_Manchester": "Astley is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan in Greater Manchester , England , which is crossed by the Bridgewater Canal and the A580 East Lancashire Road . Continuous with Tyldesley , it is equidistant from Wigan and Manchester , both 8.3 miles ( 13.4 km ) away . The Astley Mosley Common ward had a population of 11,270 at the 2011 Census . Historically in Lancashire , Astley 's name is Old English , indicating Anglo-Saxon settlement . It means either east Leigh , a reference to its location relative to Leigh , or \u0113astl\u0113ah the eastern wood or clearing . Throughout the Middle Ages , Astley constituted a township within the parish of Leigh and hundred of West Derby . Astley appears in written form as Asteleghe in 1210 , when its lord of the manor granted land to the religious order of Premonstratensian canons at Cockersand Abbey . Medieval and Early Modern Astley is distinguished by the dignitaries who occupied Damhouse , the local manor house around which a settlement expanded . The Bridgewater Canal reached Astley in 1795 , and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830 . The Industrial Revolution introduced the factory system when the village 's cotton mill was built in 1833 . Coal mining became an important industry . Mining subsidence coupled with structural and political changes to the mining industry began the decline in Astley 's industrial activities during the mid-20th century ; its cotton mill closed in 1955 , and the last coal was brought to the surface in 1970 .",

Its collieries exploited the coal mines ( seams ) of the middle coal measures in the Manchester Coalfield . Pits had been sunk in the 1730s and in the 1740s John Heathcote who owned the pits employed Matthew Fletcher . The Fletchers had extensive interests in coal mining in the area and , by the 1750s , Fletcher owned the collieries . The Clifton and Kersley Coal Company which took over collieries owned by the Fletchers was started by Edward and Alfred Pilkington in 1867 . The company owned Newtown and Wet Earth Collieries in Clifton , Outwood Colliery in Outwood and Little Hey . Manor , Scowcrofts and Spindle Point Collieries in Kearsley . Astley Green Colliery in Astley opened in 1912 . In 1896 the company employed 2,729 workers , 2,146 of them underground while in 1923 it employed 4,300 workers , nearly 2,000 of them at its newest colliery Astley Green . In 1929 the company became part of Manchester Collieries .",
  "/wiki/Bridgewater_Canal": "The Bridgewater Canal connects Runcorn , Manchester and Leigh , in North West England . It was commissioned by Francis Egerton , 3rd Duke of Bridgewater , to transport coal from his mines in Worsley to Manchester . It was opened in 1761 from Worsley to Manchester , and later extended from Manchester to Runcorn , and then from Worsley to Leigh . The canal is connected to the Manchester Ship Canal via a lock at Cornbrook ; to the Rochdale Canal in Manchester ; to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook , southeast of Runcorn ; and to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh . It once connected with the River Mersey at Runcorn but has since been cut off by a slip road to the Silver Jubilee Bridge . Following the construction of the Sankey Brook Navigation , Bridgewater has been argued to be the first true canal of the Industrial Revolution in England , and it required the construction of an aqueduct to cross the River Irwell , one of the first of its kind . Its success helped inspire a period of intense canal building in Britain , known as Canal Mania . It later faced intense competition from the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the Macclesfield Canal . Navigable throughout its history , it is one of the few canals in Britain not to have been nationalised , and remains privately owned . Pleasure craft now use the canal which forms part of the Cheshire Ring network of canals .",
  "/wiki/Chat_Moss": "Chat Moss is a large area of peat bog that makes up 30 per cent of the City of Salford , in Greater Manchester , England . North of the Manchester Ship Canal and River Mersey , five miles ( 8 km ) to the west of Manchester , it occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles ( 27.5 km2 ) . As it might be recognised today , Chat Moss is thought to be about 7,000 years old , but peat development seems to have begun there with the ending of the last ice age , about 10,000 years ago . The depth of peat ranges from 24 to 30 feet ( 7 to 9 m ) . A great deal of reclamation work has been carried out , particularly during the 19th century , but a large-scale network of drainage channels is still required to keep the land from reverting to bog . In 1958 workers extracting peat discovered the severed head of what is believed to be a Romano-British Celt , possibly a sacrificial victim , in the eastern part of the bog near Worsley . Much of Chat Moss is now prime agricultural land , although farming in the area is in decline . A 228-acre ( 92 ha ) area of Chat Moss , notified as Astley and Bedford Mosses , was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989 . Along with nearby Risley Moss and Holcroft Moss , Astley and Bedford Mosses has also been designated as a European Union Special Area of Conservation , known as Manchester Mosses . Chat Moss threatened the completion of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway , until George Stephenson , with advice from East Anglian marshland specialist Robert Stannard , succeeded in constructing a railway line through it in 1829 ; his solution was to float the line on a bed of bound heather and branches topped with tar and covered with rubble stone . The M62 motorway , completed in 1976 , also crosses the bog , to the north of Irlam .",
  "/wiki/Permian": "The Permian ( /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0r.mi.\u0259n/ PUR-mee-\u0259n ) is a geologic period and system which spans 47 million years from the end of the Carboniferous period 298.9 million years ago ( Mya ) , to the beginning of the Triassic period 251.902 Mya . It is the last period of the Paleozoic era ; the following Triassic period belongs to the Mesozoic era . The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison , who named it after the region of Perm in Russia . The Permian witnessed the diversification of the early amniotes into the ancestral groups of the mammals , turtles , lepidosaurs , and archosaurs . The world at the time was dominated by two continents known as Pangaea and Siberia , surrounded by a global ocean called Panthalassa . The Carboniferous rainforest collapse left behind vast regions of desert within the continental interior . Amniotes , which could better cope with these drier conditions , rose to dominance in place of their amphibian ancestors . The Permian ( along with the Paleozoic ) ended with the Permian-Triassic extinction event , the largest mass extinction in Earth 's history , in which nearly 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species died out . It would take well into the Triassic for life to recover from this catastrophe . Recovery from the Permian-Triassic extinction event was protracted ; on land , ecosystems took 30 million years to recover .",

  "/wiki/Tyldesley": "Tyldesley ( /\u02c8t\u026alzli\u02d0/ or /\u02c8t\u026alsli\u02d0/ ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan in Greater Manchester , England , but historically in Lancashire . It is north of Chat Moss near the foothills of the West Pennine Moors , 7.7 miles ( 12.4 km ) southeast of Wigan and 8.9 miles ( 14.3 km ) northwest of Manchester . At the United Kingdom Census 2001 , the Tyldesley built-up area , excluding Shakerley , had a population of 16,142 . The remains of a Roman road passing through the township on its ancient course between Coccium ( Wigan ) and Mamucium ( Manchester ) were evident during the 19th century . Following the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain , Tyldesley was part of the manor of Warrington , until the Norman conquest of England , when the settlement constituted a township called Tyldesley-with-Shakerley in the ancient parish of Leigh . The factory system and textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution triggered population growth and urbanisation , and by the early 20th century it was said that the mill town was eminently characteristic of an industrial district whose natural features have been almost entirely swept away to give place to factories , iron foundries , and collieries . After industrial activity declined in the late 20th century , land reclamation and post-war residential developments have altered the landscape and encouraged economic activity along Elliott Street .",
