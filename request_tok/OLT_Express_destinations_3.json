While it was occasionally cited as the world 's oldest operating commercial airport , the title was disputed by several other airports , and is no longer an issue since its closure . Tempelhof was one of Europe 's three iconic pre-World War II airports , the others being London 's now defunct Croydon Airport and the old Paris-Le Bourget Airport . It acquired a further iconic status as the centre of the Berlin Airlift of 1948-49 . One of the airport 's most distinctive features is its massive , canopy-style roof extending over the apron , able to accommodate most contemporary airliners in the 1950s , 1960s and early 1970s , protecting passengers from the elements .

Tempelhof Airport closed all operations on 30 October 2008 , despite the efforts of some protesters to prevent the closure . A non-binding referendum was held on 27 April 2008 against the impending closure but failed due to low voter turnout .",
