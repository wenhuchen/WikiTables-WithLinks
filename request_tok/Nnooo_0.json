  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
  "/wiki/North_America": "North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere . It is also considered by some [ quantify ] to be a northern subcontinent of the Americas . It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean , to the east by the Atlantic Ocean , to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean , and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea . North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers ( 9,540,000 square miles ) , about 16.5% of the earth 's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface . North America is the third largest continent by area , following Asia and Africa , and the fourth by population after Asia , Africa , and Europe . In 2013 , its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states , or about 7.5% of the world 's population , if nearby islands ( most notably around the Caribbean ) are included . North America was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period , via crossing the Bering land bridge approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago . The so-called Paleo-Indian period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago ( the beginning of the Archaic or Meso-Indian period ) . The Classic stage spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries . The Pre-Columbian era ended in 1492 , with the beginning of the transatlantic migrations - the arrival of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the Early Modern period . Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists , indigenous peoples , African slaves and their descendants . Owing to Europe 's colonization of the Americas , most North Americans speak European languages such as English , Spanish or French , and their states ' cultures commonly reflect Western traditions .",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",

  "/wiki/Wii": "The Wii ( /wi\u02d0/ WEE ; known unofficially as the Nintendo Wii ) is a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 19 , 2006 . As a seventh-generation console , the Wii competed with Microsoft 's Xbox 360 and Sony 's PlayStation 3 . Nintendo states that its console targets a broader demographic than that of the two others . As of the first quarter of 2016 [ update ] , the Wii led its generation over the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in worldwide sales , with more than 101 million units sold ; in December 2009 , the console broke the sales record for a single month in the United States . The Wii introduced the Wii Remote controller , which can be used as a handheld pointing device and which detects movement in three dimensions . The console runs games supplied on Wii optical discs . It also supported the now discontinued WiiConnect24 service , which enabled Wii to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby mode . Like other seventh-generation consoles it supported a service , called Virtual Console , that downloaded emulated games from past Nintendo consoles , support for online video streaming such as BBC iPlayer , and other services provided by Nintendo over the Internet . From June 28 , 2013 , Internet services were gradually discontinued ; since January 31 , 2019 , only re-download of games , system software update , and transfer of data between Wii and Wii U continued to be available , to be withdrawn at an unspecified future date . Wii Points could no longer be purchased after March 2018 , and could not be used and were permanently lost from January 31 , 2019 . The Wii succeeded the GameCube ; early models are fully backward-compatible with all GameCube games and most accessories . Nintendo first spoke of the console at the E3 2004 press conference and later unveiled it at E3 2005 .",
  "/wiki/WiiWare": "WiiWare was a service that allowed Wii users to download games and applications specifically designed and developed for the Wii video game console made by Nintendo . These games and applications could only be purchased and downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel under the WiiWare section . Once the user had downloaded the game or application , it would appear in their Wii Menu or SD Card Menu as a new channel . WiiWare was a companion to the Virtual Console , which specializes in emulated games originally developed for other systems instead of original games . WiiWare was promoted as an avenue for developers with small budgets to release innovative , original , and smaller-scale games without the cost and risk of creating a title to be sold at retail ( akin to Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Store ) . The development kit cost around US $ 2000 and developers needed to be licensed with and approved by Nintendo . According to Nintendo , the remarkable motion controls will give birth to fresh takes on established genres , as well as original ideas that currently exist only in developers ' minds . Nintendo handled all pricing options for the downloadable games . Like Virtual Console games , WiiWare was purchased using Wii Shop Points . However , unlike Virtual Console games , instruction manuals were stored on the Wii Shop Channel itself . Unlike its portable equivalent DSiWare , WiiWare games are currently unavailable natively via the Nintendo eShop . However , WiiWare games were purchasable and fully playable on the Wii U console - the Wii 's successor - via Wii Mode .",

The fourth iteration , entitled Nintendo DSi XL , is a larger model that launched in Japan on November 21 , 2009 , and worldwide beginning in March 2010 . Development of the DSi began in late 2006 , and the handheld was unveiled during an October 2008 Nintendo conference in Tokyo . Consumer demand convinced Nintendo to produce a slimmer handheld with larger screens than the DS Lite . Consequently , Nintendo removed the Game Boy Advance ( GBA ) cartridge slot to improve portability without sacrificing durability . While the DSi 's design is similar to that of the DS Lite , it features two digital cameras , supports internal and external content storage , and connects to an online store called the Nintendo DSi Shop . Nintendo stated that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles . Its new functionality was intended to facilitate personalization , so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a DSi . The handheld supports exclusive physical media in addition to DS games with DSi-specific features and standard DS titles . The only exception to its backward compatibility are earlier DS games that required the GBA slot .",

Nintendo announced the console in March 2010 and officially unveiled it at E3 2010 on June 15 . The console succeeds the Nintendo DS , featuring backward compatibility with older Nintendo DS video games . Its primary competitor was Sony 's PlayStation Vita . The handheld offers new features such as the StreetPass and SpotPass tag modes , powered by Nintendo Network ; augmented reality , using its 3D cameras ; and Virtual Console , which allows owners to download and play games originally released on older video game systems .

The company offered ten free Nintendo Entertainment System games and ten free Game Boy Advance games from the Nintendo eShop to consumers who bought the system at the original launch price . This strategy was considered a major success , and the console went on to become one of Nintendo 's most successful handheld consoles in the first two years of its release .

It is the successor to both the Wii Shop Channel and DSi Shop . Unlike on the Nintendo 3DS , the eShop was made available on the launch date of the Wii U , although a system update is required in order to access it . It is also a multitasking application , which means it is easily accessible even when a game is already running in the background through the system software , though this feature is exclusive to the Wii U and the Nintendo Switch .

  "/wiki/PlayStation_Vita": "The PlayStation Vita ( also known as the PS Vita or simply Vita ) is a handheld video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment . It was first released in Japan on December 17 , 2011 , and in North America , Europe , and other international territories beginning on February 22 , 2012 . The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable , and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices ; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles , it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS . The original model of the handheld includes a 5-inch ( 130 mm ) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen , two analog joysticks , and front and shoulder push-button input , and supports Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , and optional 3G . Internally , the Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core SGX543MP graphics processing unit . The PS Vita 2000 series , a revised version of the system , was released across 2013 and 2014 , sports all of the same features with a slightly smaller size , extended battery life , and an LCD screen replacing the OLED display . Sony also released the PlayStation TV , a short-lived , re-purposed version of the Vita that allowed for the play of PS Vita games on a television screen similar to a home video game console , though the PS TV variant was discontinued by the end of 2015 . The system 's design was created to meld the experience of big budget , dedicated video game platforms with the then up-and-coming trend of mobile gaming through smart phones and tablets . However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units .",

The Wii U Pro Controller can be used in its place as a more traditional alternative . The Wii U is backward compatible with all Wii software and accessories . Games can support any combination of the GamePad , Wii Remote , Nunchuk , Balance Board , or Nintendo 's Classic Controller or Wii U Pro Controller . Online functionality centers around the Nintendo Network platform and Miiverse , an integrated social networking service which allows users to share content in game-specific communities . The Wii U was met with a generally positive reception , which included praise for its innovative GamePad controller , improvements to online functionality over the Wii , backwards compatibility with existing Wii software and peripherals , and relative affordability . However , the Wii U was also criticized for the GamePad 's short battery life and issues with the console 's user interface and functionality . The Wii U was met with slow consumer adoption , with low sales that were primarily credited to a weak lineup of launch titles , limited third-party support , and poor marketing .",

Critics and third-party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors ; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as significant and obvious . Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales . By the end of September 2019 , over 102 million PlayStation 4 consoles had been shipped worldwide , surpassing lifetime sales of the PlayStation 3 . On September 7 , 2016 , Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim , a smaller version of the console ; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro , which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU clock rate to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games .",
