  "/wiki/Medal_of_Honor": "The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor . The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress . Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin . According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States , there have been 3,525 Medals of Honor awarded to 3,506 individuals since the decoration 's creation , with over 40% awarded for actions during the American Civil War .",
  "/wiki/Guadalcanal_Campaign": "The Guadalcanal campaign , also known as the Battle of Guadalcanal and codenamed Operation Watchtower by American forces , was a military campaign fought between 7 August 1942 and 9 February 1943 on and around the island of Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater of World War II . It was the first major land offensive by Allied forces against the Empire of Japan . On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces , predominantly United States Marines , landed on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Florida in the southern Solomon Islands , with the objective of using Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases in supporting a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain . The Japanese defenders , who had occupied those islands since May 1942 , were outnumbered and overwhelmed by the Allies , who captured Tulagi and Florida , as well as the airfield - later named Henderson Field - that was under construction on Guadalcanal . Surprised by the Allied offensive , the Japanese made several attempts between August and November to retake Henderson Field . Three major land battles , seven large naval battles ( five nighttime surface actions and two carrier battles ) , and almost daily aerial battles culminated in the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in early November , with the defeat of the last Japanese attempt to bombard Henderson Field from the sea and to land enough troops to retake it . In December , the Japanese abandoned their efforts to retake Guadalcanal , and evacuated their remaining forces by 7 February 1943 , in the face of an offensive by the U.S. Army 's XIV Corps . The Guadalcanal campaign was a significant strategic Allied combined-arms victory in the Pacific theater . While the Battle of Midway was a heavy defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy , it did not stop Japanese offensives , which continued both at sea and on the ground . The victories at Milne Bay , Buna-Gona , and Guadalcanal marked the Allied transition from defensive operations to taking the strategic initiative in the theater , leading to offensive campaigns in the Solomon Islands , New Guinea , and the Central Pacific , which resulted in the surrender of Japan , ending World War II .",

In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World . Virginia 's state nickname , the Old Dominion , is a reference to this status . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia . Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction , both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia .

  "/wiki/Saint": "A saint is a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness or closeness to God . However , the use of the term saint depends on the context and denomination . In Roman Catholic , Eastern Orthodox , Anglican , Oriental Orthodox , and Lutheran doctrine , all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints , but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation ; official ecclesiastical recognition , and consequently veneration , is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church . While the English word saint originated in Christianity , historians of religion now use the appellation in a more general way to refer to the state of special holiness that many religions attribute to certain people , with the Jewish tzadik , the Islamic wal\u012b , the Hindu rishi or Sikh guru , the Shintoist kami , and the Buddhist arhat or bodhisattva also being referred to as saints .

  "/wiki/Fred_Phelps": "Fred Waldron Phelps Sr. ( November 13 , 1929 - March 19 , 2014 ) was an American minister and civil rights attorney who served as pastor of the Westboro Baptist Church and became known for his extreme views against homosexuality and protests near the funerals of gay people , military veterans , and disaster victims who he believed were killed as a result of God punishing the U.S. for having bankrupt values and tolerating homosexuality . The Westboro Baptist Church , a Topeka , Kansas-based independent fundamentalist ministry that Phelps founded in 1955 , has been called arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in America . Its signature slogan , God Hates Fags , remains the name of the group 's principal website . In addition to funerals , Phelps and his followers - mostly his own immediate family members - picketed gay pride gatherings , high-profile political events , university commencement ceremonies , live performances of The Laramie Project , and functions sponsored by mainstream Christian groups with which he had no affiliation , arguing it was their sacred duty to warn others of God 's anger . He continued doing so in the face of numerous legal challenges - some of which reached the U.S. Supreme Court - and near-universal opposition and contempt from other religious groups and the general public . Laws enacted at both the federal and state levels for the specific purpose of curtailing his disruptive activities were limited in their effectiveness due to the Constitutional protections afforded to Phelps under the First Amendment . Although Phelps died in 2014 , the Westboro Baptist Church remains in operation . It continues to conduct regular demonstrations outside movie theaters , universities , government buildings , and other facilities in Topeka and elsewhere , and is still characterized as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center .",
  "/wiki/Westboro_Baptist_Church": "Westboro Baptist Church ( WBC ) is an American church known for its use of inflammatory hate speech , especially against LGBT+ people , Catholics , Orthodox Christians , atheists , Muslims , Jews , and U.S. soldiers and politicians . Multiple sources describe it as a hate group and the WBC is monitored as such by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center . The church has been involved in actions against gay people since at least 1991 , when it sought a crackdown on homosexual activity at Gage Park six blocks northwest of the church . In addition to conducting anti-gay protests at military funerals , the organization pickets celebrity funerals and public events . Protests have also been held against Jews and Catholics , and some protests have included WBC members stomping on the American flag or flying the flag upside down on a flagpole . The church also has made statements such as thank God for dead soldiers , God blew up the troops , and God hates America . The church has faced several accusations of brainwashing and has been criticised as a cult . The church is headquartered in a residential neighborhood on the west side of Topeka about 3 miles ( 5 km ) west of the Kansas State Capitol . Its first public service was held on the afternoon of November 27 , 1955 . The church was headed by Fred Phelps before his death in March 2014 , though church representatives said the church had had no defined leader for some time before his death . The church consists primarily of members of Phelps 's extended family , and in 2011 , the church stated that it had about 40 members . The WBC is not affiliated with any Baptist denomination , although it describes itself as Primitive Baptist and following the five points of Calvinism .",

  "/wiki/National_Football_League": "The National Football League ( NFL ) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the National Football Conference ( NFC ) and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) . The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 .

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",

The Ravens were established in 1996 , after Art Modell , who was then the owner of the Cleveland Browns , announced plans to relocate the franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore in 1995 . As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland , Modell was required to leave the Browns ' history and records in Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would take control in 1999 .

  "/wiki/Corporate_director": "A board of directors is a group of people who jointly supervise the activities of an organization , which can be either a for-profit business , nonprofit organization , or a government agency . Such a board 's powers , duties , and responsibilities are determined by government regulations ( including the jurisdiction 's corporations law ) and the organization 's own constitution and bylaws . These authorities may specify the number of members of the board , how they are to be chosen , and how often they are to meet . In an organization with voting members , the board is accountable to , and might be subordinate to , the organization 's full membership , which usually vote for the members of the board . In a stock corporation , non-executive directors are voted for by the shareholders , with the board having ultimate responsibility for the management of the corporation . The board of directors appoints the chief executive officer of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction . In corporations with dispersed ownership , the identification and nomination of directors ( that shareholders vote for or against ) are often done by the board itself , leading to a high degree of self-perpetuation . In a non-stock corporation with no general voting membership , the board is the supreme governing body of the institution , and its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself .",
  "/wiki/Financial_thriller": "Financial thriller is a subgenre of thriller fiction in which the financial system and economy play a major role . The novel The Financier ( 1912 ) by Theodore Dreiser displays elements of a financial thriller . Paul Erdman helped popularize the modern financial thriller , with The Billion Dollar Sure Thing ( 1973 ) . The former president of a Swiss bank , he penned the novel while in jail awaiting trial on fraud charges related to speculating in the cocoa market . In many cases the protagonist of a financial thriller is a financial professional such as Christian Slaters character in the 2005 film The Deal , or John Kent in Martin Bodenham 's 2011 novel , The Geneva Connection . Often , the plot centers on a financial crime . It may be a crime that merely enriches a small number of individuals as with The Millionaires by Brad Meltzer , or one that threatens the entire financial system , as in Tom Clancys Debt of Honor . In Flash Crash , by Denison Hatch the financial crime involves an algorithmic programmer ( quant ) who is blackmailed into writing a program that will crash the international gold markets . Financial thrillers are often used as morality plays to illustrate the evils of greed , as in Black Money ( 1995 ) , by Michael M. Thomas . In the wake of the late-2000s financial crisis , some financial thrillers took on educational roles . The 2011 HBO TV-movie Too Big to Fail is , in the words of Jesse Eisinger , extraordinarily revealing about the financial crisis but not always in a helpful way . For example , Eisinger says , The government gave the banks money but did n't get voting rights and did n't prevent the banks from using the money to pay dividends or bonuses .",

An elderly Lebanese man , a custodian/vendor who was known to work and sleep in his concession stand next to the building , was also killed in the first blast . The explosives used were later estimated to be equivalent to as much as 9,500 kg ( 21,000 pounds ) of TNT . Minutes later , a second suicide bomber struck the nine-story Drakkar building , a few kilometers away , where the French contingent was stationed ; 55 paratroopers from the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment and three paratroopers of the 9th Parachute Chasseur Regiment were killed and 15 injured . It was the single worst French military loss since the end of the Algerian War . The wife and four children of a Lebanese janitor at the French building were also killed , and more than twenty other Lebanese civilians were injured . A group called Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the bombings and said that the aim was to force the MNF out of Lebanon . According to Caspar Weinberger , then United States Secretary of Defense , there is no knowledge of who did the bombing . Some analysis highlights the role of Hezbollah and Iran , calling it an Iranian operation from top to bottom ."
