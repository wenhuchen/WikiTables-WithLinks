  "intro": "The following is a List of Michigan State Historic Sites. The register is maintained by the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office, which was established in the late 1960s after the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Sites marked with a dagger (\u2020) are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan. Those with a double dagger (\u2021) are also designated National Historic Landmarks. As of June 2011, there were more than 2,700 total listings distributed through each of Michigan's 83 counties. In addition, several historical markers have been erected outside of Michigan."
