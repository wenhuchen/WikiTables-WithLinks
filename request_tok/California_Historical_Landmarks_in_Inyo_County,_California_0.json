  "/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park": "Death Valley National Park is an American national park that straddles the California-Nevada border , east of the Sierra Nevada . The park boundaries include Death Valley , the northern section of Panamint Valley , the southern section of Eureka Valley , and most of Saline Valley . The park occupies an interface zone between the arid Great Basin and Mojave deserts , protecting the northwest corner of the Mojave Desert and its diverse environment of salt-flats , sand dunes , badlands , valleys , canyons , and mountains . Death Valley is the largest national park in the contiguous United States , and the hottest , driest and lowest of all the national parks in the United States . The second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere is in Badwater Basin , which is 282 feet ( 86 m ) below sea level . Approximately 91% of the park is a designated wilderness area . The park is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh desert environment . Some examples include creosote bush , bighorn sheep , coyote , and the Death Valley pupfish , a survivor from much wetter times . UNESCO included Death Valley as the principal feature of its Mojave and Colorado Deserts Biosphere Reserve in 1984 . A series of Native American groups inhabited the area from as early as 7000 BC , most recently the Timbisha around 1000 AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains . A group of European-Americans , trapped in the valley in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the gold fields of California , gave the valley its name , even though only one of their group died there . Several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Bishop_Creek": "Battle of Bishop Creek was one of the early engagements of the Owens Valley Indian War fought on April 6 , 1862 along Bishop Creek , in what is now Inyo County , California . In 1861 , cattle were being driven over the Sierra Nevada Mountains to feed the mining boom town of Aurora . Some cattlemen had begun ranching nearby in the Owens Valley . The consequences of the disastrous winter caused by the Great Flood of 1862 and the encroachment of the cattle on the food supply of the Owens Valley Paiute led to the threat of starvation for them . They were forced to take cattle to feed themselves . This led to a conflict with these ranchers in several incidents . Despite a meeting and an attempt at peace between the two sides , that peace broke down in further incidents and broke into open warfare , that became known as the Owens Valley Indian War . Threatened settlers concentrated their herds 30 miles ( 48 km ) north of Owens Lake at the meadows on Oak Creek . They then sent messages for help to Aurora , then the county seat of nearby Mono County , and to Visalia , county seat of their own Tulare County , over the Sierra 's mountains , for help . William Mayfield led a band of Tulare County militiamen to the aid of the settlers there . John J. Kellogg , a former Army captain led 18 men from Aurora to aid the settlers .

  "/wiki/Manzanar": "Manzanar is best known as the site of one of ten American concentration camps , where more than 120,000 Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II from December 1942 to 1945 . Located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada in California 's Owens Valley between the towns of Lone Pine to the south and Independence to the north , it is approximately 230 miles ( 370 km ) north of Los Angeles . Manzanar ( which means apple orchard in Spanish ) was identified by the United States National Park Service as the best-preserved of the former camp sites , and is now the Manzanar National Historic Site , which preserves and interprets the legacy of Japanese American incarceration in the United States . Long before the first of the Japanese American detainees arrived in March 1942 , Manzanar was home to Native Americans , who lived mostly in villages near several creeks in the area . Ranchers and miners formally established the town of Manzanar in 1910 , but it had been abandoned by 1929 , after the City of Los Angeles purchased the water rights to virtually the entire area . As different as these groups were , their histories displayed a common thread of forced relocation . Since the last of those incarcerated left in 1945 , former detainees and others have worked to protect Manzanar and to establish it as a National Historic Site to ensure that the history of the site , along with the stories of those who were incarcerated there , is recorded for current and future generations . The primary focus is the Japanese American incarceration era , as specified in the legislation that created the Manzanar National Historic Site . The site also interprets the former town of Manzanar , the ranch days , the settlement by the Owens Valley Paiute , and the role that water played in shaping the history of the Owens Valley .",
