Carey achieved worldwide success with follow-up R & B and pop albums Music Box ( 1993 ) , Merry Christmas ( 1994 ) , and Daydream ( 1995 ) .

After separating from Mottola , Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of hip hop into her music with the release of Butterfly ( 1997 ) . Billboard named her the country 's most successful artist of the 1990s , while the World Music Awards honored her as the world 's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s , and the best-selling female artist of the millennium . After eleven consecutive years charting a U.S. number-one single , Carey parted ways with Columbia in 2000 and signed a $ 100 million recording contract with Virgin Records .
