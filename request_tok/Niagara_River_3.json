  "/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York": "Buffalo is the second largest city in the U.S. state of New York and the largest city in Western New York . As of 2018 [ update ] , the population was 256,304 . The city is the county seat of Erie County and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the Canada-United States border , forming part of the bi-national Buffalo Niagara Region . As of the April 1 , 2010 , the metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) had a population of 1,135,509 ; the combined statistical area ( CSA ) , which adds Cattaraugus County , had a population of 1,215,826 inhabitants . The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls . Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname The City of Light . The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by Joseph Ellicott , an extensive system of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted , as well as significant architectural works .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

It is adjacent to the Niagara River , across from the city of Niagara Falls , Ontario , and named after the famed Niagara Falls which they share . The city is within the Buffalo-Niagara Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Western New York region . While the city was formerly occupied by Native Americans , Europeans who migrated to the Niagara Falls in the mid-17th century began to open businesses and develop infrastructure . Later in the 18th and 19th centuries , scientists and businessmen began harnessing the power of the Niagara River for electricity and the city began to attract manufacturers and other businesses drawn by the promise of inexpensive hydroelectric power . After the 1960s , however , the city and region witnessed an economic decline , following an attempt at urban renewal under then Mayor Lackey . Consistent with the rest of the Rust Belt as industries left the city , old line affluent families relocated to nearby suburbs and out of town . Despite the decline in heavy industry , Niagara Falls State Park and the downtown area closest to the falls continue to thrive as a result of tourism . The population , however , has continued to decline from a peak of 102,394 in the 1960s due to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the area .",

The phrase La Grande \u00cele appears on the town seal . Over its history , Grand Island has served as home to the Attawandaron Nation and been an acquisition of both French and English colonial pursuits . In 1945 , Grand Island was part of a plan to make a new World Peace Capital on the international border between Southern Ontario , Canada , and Western New York . The plan proposed placing the United Nations headquarters on adjacent Navy Island ( Ontario ) , which was considered an ideal location because it lay on the boundary between two peaceful countries . An artist 's rendering of the World Peace Capital showed the property with bridges spanning both countries ( between Grand Island in the United States and the Canadian mainland ) . The proposal was turned down in favor of the current U.N. headquarters in New York City .

Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

Ownership of the properties was transferred to area pioneers Samuel Street and Thomas Clark by 1801 , with the islands named Clark Hill Islands in 1805 . The mills were burned by American forces on July 26 , 1814 , following the Battle of Lundy 's Lane during the War of 1812 . Thomas Clark T.C . Street took ownership of Clark Hill Islands in 1854 , renaming them Cynthia Islands . They became accessible to the public in 1877 , when Sutherland Macklem , Street 's heir , built a pair of suspension bridges to carry foot & carriage traffic across .

  "/wiki/Gull_Island_(Niagara_River)": "The Niagara River ( /na\u026a\u02c8\u00e6\u0261\u0259r\u0259/ ny-AG-\u0259r-\u0259 ) is a river that flows north from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario . It forms part of the border between the province of Ontario in Canada ( on the west ) and the state of New York in the United States ( on the east ) . There are differing theories as to the origin of the river 's name . According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger , Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the locally residing native Neutral Confederacy , who are described as being called the Niagagarega people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area . According to George R. Stewart , it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Ongniaahra , meaning point of land cut in two . The river , which is occasionally described as a strait , is about 58 kilometres ( 36 mi ) long and includes Niagara Falls in its course . The falls have moved approximately 11 kilometres ( 6.8 mi ) upstream from the Niagara Escarpment in the last 12,000 years , resulting in a gorge below the falls . Today , the diversion of the river for electrical generation has significantly reduced the rate of erosion . The total drop in elevation along the river is 99 metres ( 325 ft ) . The Niagara Gorge extends downstream from the Falls and includes the Niagara Whirlpool and another section of rapids . Power plants on the river include the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Stations ( built in 1922 and 1954 ) on the Canadian side , and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant ( built in 1961 ) on the American side . Together , they generate 4.4 gigawatts of electricity .",

As most of the readily developed hydroelectric sites became exploited , the corporation expanded into building coal-fired generation and then nuclear-powered facilities . Renamed as Ontario Hydro in 1974 , by the 1990s it had become one of the largest , fully integrated electricity corporations in North America .",
