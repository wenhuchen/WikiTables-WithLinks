Like previous Walking with . documentaries , Walking with Cavemen is produced in the style of a nature documentary , featuring a voice-over narrator ( Robert Winston in the British release , Alec Baldwin in the North American release ) who describes the recreations of the prehistoric past as if they were real . As with the predecessors , this approach necessitated the presentation of speculation as if it were fact , and some of the statements made about the behaviour of the creatures are more open to question than the documentary may indicate . The style is different in UK and US versions , as Robert Winston travels through time to the location of drama taking place , while Alec Baldwin remains ever in the present day in a lit room with skulls representative of ancestral hominid species highlighted in each drama . Each segment takes the form of a short drama featuring a group of the particular hominid in question going about their daily lives ( the search for food , protecting territory , and caring for the sick and injured ) . The intent is to get the human viewer to feel for the creatures being examined , almost to imagine being one of them ( a trait that the documentary links to the modern human brain ) .",
