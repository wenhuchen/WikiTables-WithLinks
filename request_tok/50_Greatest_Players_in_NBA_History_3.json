  "/wiki/Season_(sports)": "In an organized sports league , a typical season is the portion of one year in which regulated games of the sport are in session : for example , in Major League Baseball the season lasts approximately from the last week of March to the last week of September . In other team sports , like association football or basketball , it is generally from August or September to May although in some countries - such as Northern Europe or East Asia - the season starts in the spring and finishes in autumn , mainly due to weather conditions encountered during the winter . A year can often be broken up into several distinct sections ( sometimes themselves called seasons ) . These are : a preseason , a series of exhibition games played for training purposes ; a regular season , the main period of the league 's competition ; the postseason , a playoff tournament played against the league 's top teams to determine the league 's champion ; and the offseason , the time when there is no official competition .",
