  "/wiki/Jackson_Mound": "The Jackson Mound is a Native American mound in the south-central portion of the U.S. state of Ohio . Located north of Pancoastburg in Fayette County , it measures approximately 75 feet ( 23 m ) in diameter and 5.5 feet ( 1.7 m ) in height . The mound has never been excavated , making the certain identification of its builders impossible ; however , its location on a high terrace above a relatively small stream suggests that it was built by the Adena culture , which favored such sites for its many mounds . If true , it was originally more conical in shape ( the mound 's location in a farm field has resulted in its being damaged by years of plowing ) , and it is likely to cover the remains of a wooden charnel house built by the Adena . An archaeological survey performed in 1914 listed forty-two different mounds in Fayette County , but the Jackson Mound is the only one that has survived to the present day . For this reason , it is a significant archaeological site . In recognition of its archaeological value , it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in late 1975 , being the county 's only archaeological site to be accorded this distinction .",
