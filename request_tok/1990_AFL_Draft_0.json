  "/wiki/Brisbane_Bears": "The Brisbane Football Club , nicknamed the Bears , was the first professional Australian rules football club established in Queensland . The club , along with the West Coast Eagles , joined the Victorian Football League ( VFL ) in 1987 and played its first ever VFL game against North Melbourne at the MCG on Friday 27 March 1987 which it won 19.23.137 to 15.14.104 . Unlike the AFLs more recent expansion clubs , the Gold Coast Suns and Greater Western Sydney Giants ( GWS ) , Brisbane received absolutely no assistance from the VFL/AFL when it was first established and was given only 5 months to recruit an entire team . Despite this however , the club went on to secure 6 wins in its first season and remains the only expansion club from the northern states to avoid finishing in last place on the ladder at the end of their first season . In contrast , the Gold Coast Suns only won 3 games in their first season and GWS only won 4 . Both the Gold Coast Suns and GWS Giants , unlike Brisbane , also finished on the bottom of the ladder at the end of their first season . Brisbane made the finals for the first time in 1995 and only narrowly missed out on a position in the grand final the following year when they were defeated by North Melbourne in the preliminary finals . Many of the Brisbane players who played in this match would go to be stars of Brisbanes 2001 , 2002 and 2003 triple premiership winning teams . The club merged with the Fitzroy Football Club at the completion of the 1996 season to form the Brisbane Lions without giving their members a vote on the matter . Many Brisbane supporters are still unhappy with the way the club handled the merger and this is exasperated by the clubs reluctance to acknowledge the Bears history despite its clear willingness to regularly acknowledge that of Fitzroys . This has created significant unrest , particularly in Melbourne , between longstanding Brisbane supporters and the small number of former Fitzroy supporters who chose to support the club after Fitzroy went into administration .",
