  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",
  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassicism": "Neoclassicism ( also spelled Neo-classicism ; from Greek \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 n\u00e8os , new and Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 klasik\u03ccs , of the highest rank ) was a Western cultural movement in the decorative and visual arts , literature , theatre , music , and architecture that drew inspiration from the art and culture of classical antiquity . Neoclassicism was born in Rome largely thanks to the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann , at the time of the rediscovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum , but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their Grand Tour and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals . The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment , and continued into the early 19th century , laterally competing with Romanticism . In architecture , the style continued throughout the 19th , 20th and up to the 21st century . European Neoclassicism in the visual arts began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant Rococo style . Rococo architecture emphasizes grace , ornamentation and asymmetry ; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry , which were seen as virtues of the arts of Rome and Ancient Greece , and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century Renaissance Classicism . Each neo-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it , and ignores others . The Neoclassical writers and talkers , patrons and collectors , artists and sculptors of 1765-1830 paid homage to an idea of the generation of Phidias , but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures . They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of Late Antiquity . The Rococo art of ancient Palmyra came as a revelation , through engravings in Wood 's The Ruins of Palmyra . Even Greece was all-but-unvisited , a rough backwater of the Ottoman Empire , dangerous to explore , so Neoclassicists ' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings , which subtly smoothed and regularized , corrected and restored the monuments of Greece , not always consciously . The Empire style , a second phase of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts , had its cultural centre in Paris in the Napoleonic era .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

In a broader meaning , Bohemia sometimes refers to the entire Czech territory , including Moravia and Czech Silesia , especially in a historical context , such as the Lands of the Bohemian Crown ruled by Bohemian kings . Bohemia was a duchy of Great Moravia , later an independent principality , a kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire , and subsequently a part of the Habsburg Monarchy and the Austrian Empire . After World War I and the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak state , the total of Bohemia became a part of Czechoslovakia , defying claims of the German speaking inhabitants that regions with German speaking majority should be included in the Republic of German-Austria . Between 1938 and 1945 , these border regions were joined to Nazi Germany as the Sudetenland . The remainder of Czech territory became the Second Czechoslovak Republic and was subsequently occupied as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia . In 1969 , the Czech lands ( including Bohemia ) were given autonomy within Czechoslovakia as the Czech Socialist Republic . In 1990 , the name was changed to the Czech Republic , which became a separate state in 1993 with the breakup of Czechoslovakia . Until 1948 , Bohemia was an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia as one of its lands ( zem\u011b ) . Since then , administrative reforms have replaced self-governing lands with a modified system of regions ( kraje ) which do not follow the borders of the historical Czech lands ( or the regions from the 1960 and 2000 reforms ) . However , the three lands are mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution of the Czech Republic : We , citizens of the Czech Republic in Bohemia , Moravia and Silesia\u2026 Bohemia had an area of 52,065 km2 ( 20,102 sq mi ) and today is home to approximately 6.5 million of the Czech Republic 's 10.5 million inhabitants . Bohemia was bordered in the south by Upper and Lower Austria ( both in Austria ) , in the west by Bavaria and in the north by Saxony and Lusatia ( all in Germany ) , in the northeast by Silesia ( in Poland ) , and in the east by Moravia ( also part of the Czech Republic ) .",
