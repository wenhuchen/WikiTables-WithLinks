At the 2011 Census , it had a population of 52,419 . Historically part of Cheshire , Altrincham was established as a market town in 1290 , a time when the economy of most communities was based on agriculture rather than trade , and there is still a market in the town . Further socioeconomic development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849 , stimulating industrial activity in the town . Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham 's subsequent growth , along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall , formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford , and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I Listed Buildings and a deer park . Altrincham today is an affluent commuter town , partly because of its transport links . The town has a strong middle-class presence ; there has been a steady increase in Altrincham 's middle classes since the 19th century . It is also home to Altrincham F.C . and three ice hockey clubs : Manchester Storm , Altrincham Aces and Trafford Tornados .",

In 2011 , it had a population of 134,122 . Evidence of Stone Age , Roman , and Anglo-Saxon activity has been discovered locally . In the Middle Ages , Sale was a rural township , linked ecclesiastically with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey , whose fields and meadows were used for crop and cattle farming . By the 17th century , Sale had a cottage industry manufacturing garthweb , the woven material from which horses ' saddle girths were made . The Bridgewater Canal reached the town in 1765 , stimulating Sale 's urbanisation . The arrival of the railway in 1849 triggered Sale 's growth as a commuter town for Manchester , leading to an influx of middle class residents ; by the end of the 19th century the town 's population had more than tripled . Agriculture gradually declined as service industries boomed . Sale 's urban growth resulted in a merger with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey , following the Local Government Act 1929 . The increase in population led to the granting of a charter in 1935 , giving Sale honorific borough status . Since then , Sale has continued to thrive as a commuter town , supported by its proximity to the M60 motorway and the Manchester Metrolink network .",

Stretford borders Chorlton-cum-Hardy to the east , Urmston to the west , Salford to the north , and Sale to the south . The Bridgewater Canal bisects the town . Historically in Lancashire , in the 19th century Stretford was an agricultural village , known locally as Porkhampton due to the large number of pigs produced for the Manchester market . It was also an extensive market-gardening area , producing more than 500 long tons ( 508 t ) of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845 .

Until the late 19th century , it was the ancestral home of the Trafford family , who sold it to financier Ernest Terah Hooley in 1896 . Occupying an area of 4.7 square miles ( 12 km2 ) , it was the first planned industrial estate in the world , and remains the largest in Europe . Trafford Park is almost entirely surrounded by water ; the Bridgewater Canal forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries , and the Manchester Ship Canal , which opened in 1894 , its northeastern and northwestern . Hooley 's plan was to develop the Ship Canal frontage , but the canal was slow to generate the predicted volume of traffic , so in the early days the park was largely used for leisure activities such as golf , polo and boating . British Westinghouse was the first major company to move in , and by 1903 it was employing about half of the 12,000 workers then employed in the park , which became one of the most important engineering facilities in Britain . Trafford Park was a major supplier of materiel in the First and Second World Wars , producing the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster . At its peak in 1945 , an estimated 75,000 workers were employed in the park . Employment began to decline in the 1960s as companies closed in favour of newer , more efficient plants elsewhere . By 1967 employment had fallen to 50,000 , and the decline continued throughout the 1970s . The new generation of container ships was too large for the Manchester Ship Canal , which led to a further decline in Trafford Park 's fortunes . The workforce had fallen to 15,000 by 1976 , and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared from the park .",
