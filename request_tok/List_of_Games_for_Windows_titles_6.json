The game is set within a post-apocalyptic , open world environment that encompasses a scaled region consisting of the ruins of Washington , D.C. and much of the countryside to the north and west of it , referred to as the Capital Wasteland . It takes place within Fallout 's usual setting of a world that deviated into an alternate timeline thanks to atomic age technology , which eventually led to its devastation by a nuclear apocalypse in the year 2077 ( referred to as The Great War ) , caused by a major international conflict between the United States and China over natural resources and the last remaining supplies of untapped uranium . The main story takes place in the year 2277 , around 36 years after the events of Fallout 2 , of which it is not a direct sequel .
