He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era , one whose poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . Chopin was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw , which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland . A child prodigy , he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20 , less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising . At 21 , he settled in Paris . Thereafter - in the last 18 years of his life - he gave only 30 public performances , preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon . He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons , for which he was in high demand . Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries ( including Robert Schumann ) . After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska from 1836 to 1837 , he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin ( known by her pen name , George Sand ) . A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838-39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition . In his final years , he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling , who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848 . For most of his life , Chopin was in poor health .",

They are the only two nocturnes in opus 48 and are dedicated to Mlle . Laure Duperr\u00e9 . Chopin later sold the copyright for the nocturnes for 2,000 francs along with several other pieces . Gustav Barth commented that Chopin 's nocturnes are definite signs of progress in comparison to John Field 's original nocturnes , though the improvements are for the most part only in technique . However , David Dubal feels that the pieces are more aptly described as ballades in miniature .",
  "/wiki/Waltzes_(Chopin)": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopins waltzes are pieces of moderate length adhering to the traditional 3/4 waltz time , but are remarkably different from the earlier Viennese waltzes in that they were not designed for dancing but for concert performance . Some of them are accessible by pianists of moderate capabilities , but the more difficult of them require an advanced technique . Carl Maria von Weber 's Invitation to the Dance was an early model for Chopin 's waltzes . Chopin started writing waltzes in 1824 , when he was fourteen , and continued until the year of his death , 1849 . Probably the most famous are the Minute Waltz in D-flat major and the C-sharp minor waltz of 1847 , two of the last set of waltzes Chopin published before his death ( Op . 64 ) .",

  "/wiki/Ballades_(Chopin)": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin 's four ballades are single-movement pieces for solo piano , composed between 1831 and 1842 . They are considered to be some of the most challenging pieces in the standard piano repertoire . The term ballade was used by Chopin in the sense of a balletic interlude or dance-piece , equivalent to the old Italian ballata , but the term may also have connotations of the medieval heroic ballad , a narrative minstrel-song , often of a fantastical character . There are dramatic and dance-like elements in Chopin 's use of the genre , and he may be said to be a pioneer of the ballade as an abstract musical form . The four ballades are said to have been inspired by poet Adam Mickiewicz . The exact inspiration for each individual ballade , however , is unclear and disputed . Though the ballades do not conform exactly to sonata form , the ballade form created by Chopin for his four ballades is a distinct variant of sonata form with specific discrepancies , such as the mirror reprise ( presenting the two expositional themes in reverse order during the recapitulation ) . [ citation needed ] The ballades have directly influenced composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms who , after Chopin , wrote ballades of their own . Besides sharing the title , the four ballades are entities distinct from each other . According to composer and music critic Louis Ehlert , Each [ ballade ] differs entirely from the others , and they have but one thing in common - their romantic working out and the nobility of their motifs . Modern theorists have shown , however , that the ballades do have much in common , such as the ballade meter ( 64 or 68 ) and certain formal practices like the mirror reprise and delaying the structural dominant . The four ballades are among the most enduring of Chopin 's compositions and are frequently performed in concerts .",

In 1850 , two versions appeared simultaneously as a set of songs for high voice and piano , and as transcriptions for piano two-hands . The two poems by Uhland and the one by Freiligrath depict three different forms of love .

Its tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua , his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto , and Rigoletto 's beautiful daughter Gilda .

As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres , he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century . His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from The Love for Three Oranges , the suite Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 , the ballet Romeo and Juliet - from which Dance of the Knights is taken - and Peter and the Wolf . Of the established forms and genres in which he worked , he created - excluding juvenilia - seven completed operas , seven symphonies , eight ballets , five piano concertos , two violin concertos , a cello concerto , a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra , and nine completed piano sonatas . A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist , achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument , including his first two piano concertos . In 1915 , Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite , compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes . Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev - Chout , Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son - which at the time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues . Prokofiev 's greatest interest , however , was opera , and he composed several works in that genre , including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel . Prokofiev 's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges , composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia .

He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term . In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France 's greatest living composer . Born to a music-loving family , Ravel attended France 's premier music college , the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment , whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal . After leaving the conservatoire , Ravel found his own way as a composer , developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of baroque , neoclassicism and , in his later works , jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form , as in his best-known work , Bol\u00e9ro ( 1928 ) , in which repetition takes the place of development . He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers ' music , of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known . A slow and painstaking worker , Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries . Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano , chamber music , two piano concertos , ballet music , two operas and eight song cycles ; he wrote no symphonies or church music . Many of his works exist in two versions : first , a piano score and later an orchestration . Some of his piano music , such as Gaspard de la nuit ( 1908 ) , is exceptionally difficult to play , and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 ( 1912 ) require skilful balance in performance . Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public .",

Both nocturnes in this opus are dedicated to Countess d'Appony . This publication marked the transition from triplets of nocturnes to contrasting pairs . David Dubal feels that the pieces are more aptly described as ballades in miniature .

Unusually , neither piece carries a dedication . This set of nocturnes was originally considered to be one of the better sets , yet its popularity slowly decreased in the twentieth century . Blair Johnson maintains , however , that the pieces are still wonderful specimens , being something of a hybrid between the more dramatic Opus 27 and the far simpler textures and moods of Opus 32 . Robert Schumann commented that they were of that nobler kind under which poetic ideality gleams more transparently . Schumann also said that the two nocturnes differ from his earlier ones chiefly through greater simplicity of decoration and more quiet grace . Gustav Barth commented that Chopin 's nocturnes are definite signs of progress in comparison to John Field 's original nocturnes , though the improvements are for the most part only in technique . However , David Dubal feels that the pieces are more aptly described as ballades in miniature .",

First published 21 years after the composer 's death , the piece is usually referred to as Lento con gran espressione , from its tempo marking . It is sometimes also called Reminiscence . The piece was played by Holocaust survivor Natalia Karp for the Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth , with Goeth being so impressed with the rendition that he spared Karp 's life . This was also the piece played by Holocaust survivor and famed Polish pianist W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman ( the central figure of the 2002 Roman Polanski film The Pianist ) during the last live broadcast of Polish radio on September 23 , 1939 when Warsaw was besieged by the German army .

  "/wiki/EMI_Classics": "EMI Classics was a record label founded by EMI in 1990 in order to reduce the need to create country-specific packaging and catalogs for internationally distributed classical music releases . Following the European Commission 's approval of the takeover of EMI Group by Universal Music in September 2012 , EMI Classics was listed for divestment . The label was sold to Warner Music Group , which absorbed EMI Classics into Warner Classics in 2013 . Classical recordings were formerly simultaneously released under combinations of Angel , Seraphim , Odeon , Columbia , His Master 's Voice , and other labels , in part because competitors own these names in various countries . These were moved under the EMI Classics umbrella to avoid the trademark problems . Prior to this , compact discs distributed globally bore the Angel Records recording angel logo that EMI owned globally . Releases created for distribution in specific countries continued to be distributed under the historical names , with the exception of Columbia , since EMI had sold the Columbia name to Sony Music Entertainment . The red logo harkens back to the Red Seal releases , introduced by EMI predecessor the Gramophone Company in 1902 : HMV classical releases were issued with red labels . EMI Classics also included the Virgin Classics label , both of them were formerly managed under The Blue Note Label Group in the U.S. until 2013 . With the sale of EMI to Universal Music Group in 2012 , European regulators forced Universal Music to divest itself of EMI Classics , which was operated with other European EMI assets to be divested as the Parlophone Label Group . In February 2013 , Universal Music sold the Parlophone Label Group , including EMI Classics and Virgin Classics , to Warner Music Group .

He was a crucial figure in the transition between the classical and romantic eras in classical music and is considered to be one of the greatest composers of all time . Beethoven was born in Bonn , the capital of the Electorate of Cologne , which was part of the Holy Roman Empire . His musical talent was obvious at an early age , and he was harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven , who thought this would enable him to become a child prodigy like Mozart . He was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe . At age 21 , he moved to Vienna and studied composition with Joseph Haydn . Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist , and he was soon courted by Karl Alois , Prince Lichnowsky for compositions , which resulted in Opus 1 in 1795 . The piece was a great critical and commercial success and was followed by Symphony No . 1 in 1800 . This composition was distinguished by its frequent use of sforzandi , sudden shifts in tonal centers ( which were uncommon for traditional symphonic form ) , and the prominent , more independent use of wind instruments . In 1801 , he also gained fame for his six String Quartets and for the ballet The Creatures of Prometheus .

Although commonly thought to be one of the few works to be named by the composer himself , it was actually named Grande sonate path\u00e9tique ( to Beethoven 's liking ) by the publisher , who was impressed by the sonata 's tragic sonorities . Prominent musicologists debate whether or not the Path\u00e9tique may have been inspired by Mozart 's piano sonata K. 457 , since both compositions are in C minor and have three very similar movements .

One of his greatest and most technically challenging piano sonatas , the Appassionata was considered by Beethoven to be his most tempestuous piano sonata until the twenty-ninth piano sonata ( known as the Hammerklavier ) [ citation needed ] . 1803 was the year Beethoven came to grips with the irreversibility of his progressively deteriorating hearing .
