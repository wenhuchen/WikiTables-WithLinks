  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
