  "/wiki/Alchemy": "Alchemy ( from Arabic : al-k\u012bmiy\u0101 ) was an ancient branch of natural philosophy , a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practised throughout Europe , Africa , and Asia , originating in Greco-Roman Egypt in the first few centuries . Alchemists attempted to purify , mature , and perfect certain materials . [ n 1 ] Common aims were chrysopoeia , the transmutation of base metals ( e.g. , lead ) into noble metals ( particularly gold ) ; the creation of an elixir of immortality ; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease ; and the development of an alkahest , a universal solvent . The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and , in the Hellenistic and Western mystery tradition , the achievement of gnosis . In Europe , the creation of a philosopher 's stone was variously connected with all of these projects . In English , the term is often limited to descriptions of European alchemy , but similar practices existed in the Far East , the Indian subcontinent , and the Muslim world . In Europe , following the 12th-century Renaissance produced by the translation of Medieval Islamic works on science and the rediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy , alchemists played a significant role in early modern science ( particularly chemistry and medicine ) . Islamic and European alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques , theory , terminology , and experimental method , some of which are still in use today . However , they continued antiquity 's belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism . Their work was guided by Hermetic principles related to magic , mythology , and religion . Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects , despite the arguments of scholars like Holmyard and von Franz that they should be understood as complementary . The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry , medicine , and charlatanism , and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred .",
  "/wiki/Philologist": "Philology is the study of language in oral and written historical sources ; it is the intersection of textual criticism , literary criticism , history , and linguistics . [ page needed ] Philology is more commonly defined as the study of literary texts as well as oral and written records , the establishment of their authenticity and their original form , and the determination of their meaning . A person who pursues this kind of study is known as a philologist . In older usage , especially British , philology is more general , covering comparative and historical linguistics . Classical philology studies classical languages . Classical philology principally originated from the Library of Pergamum and the Library of Alexandria around the fourth century BCE , continued by Greeks and Romans throughout the Roman/Byzantine Empire . It was preserved and promoted during the Islamic Golden Age , and eventually resumed by European scholars of the Renaissance , where it was soon joined by philologies of other non-Asian ( European ) ( Germanic , Celtic ) , Eurasian ( Slavistics , etc . ) , Asian ( Arabic , Persian , Sanskrit , Chinese , etc . ) , and African ( Egyptian , Nubian , etc . ) languages . Indo-European studies involves the comparative philology of all Indo-European languages . Philology , with its focus on historical development ( diachronic analysis ) , is contrasted with linguistics due to Ferdinand de Saussure 's insistence on the importance of synchronic analysis .",

  "/wiki/Solid-state_electronics": "Solid-state electronics means semiconductor electronics ; electronic equipment using semiconductor devices such as transistors , diodes and integrated circuits ( ICs ) . The term is also used for devices in which semiconductor electronics which have no moving parts replace devices with moving parts , such as the solid-state relay in which transistor switches are used in place of a moving-arm electromechanical relay , or the solid-state drive ( SSD ) a type of semiconductor memory used in computers to replace hard disk drives , which store data on a rotating disk . The term solid state became popular in the beginning of the semiconductor era in the 1960s to distinguish this new technology based on the transistor , in which the electronic action of devices occurred in a solid state , from previous electronic equipment that used vacuum tubes , in which the electronic action occurred in a gaseous state . A semiconductor device works by controlling an electric current consisting of electrons or holes moving within a solid crystalline piece of semiconducting material such as silicon , while the thermionic vacuum tubes it replaced worked by controlling current conducted by a gas of particles , electrons or ions , moving in a vacuum within a sealed tube .",

  "/wiki/Semiconductors": "A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a conductor , such as metallic copper , and an insulator , such as glass . Its resistance falls as its temperature rises ; metals are the opposite . Its conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by introducing impurities ( doping ) into the crystal structure . Where two differently-doped regions exist in the same crystal , a semiconductor junction is created . The behavior of charge carriers which include electrons , ions and electron holes at these junctions is the basis of diodes , transistors and all modern electronics . Some examples of semiconductors are silicon , germanium , gallium arsenide , and elements near the so-called metalloid staircase on the periodic table . After silicon , gallium arsenide is the second most common semiconductor [ citation needed ] and is used in laser diodes , solar cells , microwave-frequency integrated circuits and others . Silicon is a critical element for fabricating most electronic circuits . Semiconductor devices can display a range of useful properties such as passing current more easily in one direction than the other , showing variable resistance , and sensitivity to light or heat . Because the electrical properties of a semiconductor material can be modified by doping , or by the application of electrical fields or light , devices made from semiconductors can be used for amplification , switching , and energy conversion . The conductivity of silicon is increased by adding a small amount ( of the order of 1 in 108 ) of pentavalent ( antimony , phosphorus , or arsenic ) or trivalent ( boron , gallium , indium ) atoms . This process is known as doping and resulting semiconductors are known as doped or extrinsic semiconductors .",

This modern field of study is regarded as a branch of the atmospheric sciences and a subfield of physical geography , which is one of the Earth sciences . Climatology now includes aspects of oceanography and biogeochemistry . The main methods employed by climatologists are the analysis of observations and modelling the physical laws that determine the climate . The main topics of research are the study of climate variability , mechanisms of climate changes and modern climate change . Basic knowledge of climate can be used within shorter term weather forecasting , for instance about climatic cycles such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) , the Madden-Julian oscillation ( MJO ) , the North Atlantic oscillation ( NAO ) , the Arctic oscillation ( AO ) , the Pacific decadal oscillation ( PDO ) , and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation ( IPO ) . Climate models are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate . Weather is known as the condition of the atmosphere over a period of time , while climate has to do with the atmospheric condition over an extended to indefinite period of time .",

The institute is located at Columbia University in New York City . Research at the GISS emphasizes a broad study of global change , the natural and anthropogenic changes in our environment that affect the habitability of our planet . These effects may occur on greatly differing time scales , from one-time forcings such as volcanic explosions , to seasonal/annual effects such as El Ni\u00f1o , and on up to the millennia of ice ages . The institute 's research combines analysis of comprehensive global datasets , ( derived from surface stations combined with satellite data for SSTs ) , with global models of atmospheric , land surface , and oceanic processes . Study of past climate change on Earth and of other planetary atmospheres provides an additional tool in assessing our general understanding of the atmosphere and its evolution . GISS was established in May 1961 by Robert Jastrow to do basic research in space sciences in support of Goddard programs . Formally the institute was the New York City office of the GSFC Theoretical Division but was known as the Goddard Space Flight Center Institute for Space Studies or in some publications as simply the Institute for Space Studies . But even before it opened , the institute had been referred to in the press as the Goddard Institute for Space Studies . It was separated from the Theoretical Division in July 1962 . Its offices were originally located in The Interchurch Center , and the institute moved into Columbia 's Armstrong Hall ( formerly the Ostend apartments and then the Oxford Residence Hotel ) in April 1966 . From 1981 to 2013 , GISS was directed by James E. Hansen .",
