  "/wiki/Apollo": "Apollo [ a ] is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology . The national divinity of the Greeks , Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery , music and dance , truth and prophecy , healing and diseases , the Sun and light , poetry , and more . He is the son of Zeus and Leto , and the twin brother of Artemis , goddess of the hunt . Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros ( ephebe , or a beardless , athletic youth ) , Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods . Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu . As the patron deity of Delphi ( Apollo Pythios ) , Apollo is an oracular god - the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle . Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil ; various epithets call him the averter of evil . Delphic Apollo is the patron of seafarers , foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees . Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo , whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius . Apollo delivered people from epidemics , yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague with his arrows . The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis . Apollo is usually described as carrying a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows .",
  "/wiki/Belenus": "Belenus ( also Belenos , Belinus , Bel , Beli Mawr ) is a sun god from Celtic mythology and , in the 3rd century , the patron deity of the Italian city of Aquileia . Called the Fair Shining One ( or The Shining God ) , he was one of the most ancient and most-widely worshiped Celtic deities and is associated with the ancient fire festival and modern Sabbat Beltane . He was associated with the horse ( as shown by the clay horse figurine offerings at Belenos 's Sainte-Sabine shrine in Burgundy ) and also the wheel . Perhaps like Apollo , with whom he became identified in the Augustan History , Belenos was thought to ride the Sun across the sky in a horse-drawn chariot .",
  "/wiki/Borvo": "In Lusitanian and Celtic polytheism , Borvo ( also known variously as Bormo , Bormanus , Bormanicus , Borbanus , Boruoboendua , Vabusoa , Labbonus or Borus ) was the Celtic God of Minerals and healing deity associated with bubbling spring water .",
  "/wiki/Grannus": "Grannus ( also Granus , Mogounus , and Amarcolitanus ) was a Celtic deity of classical antiquity . Based on the etymology of his name , Grannus may have been associated with spas , thermal springs , and the sun ; having bushy hair , beard and/or eyebrows ; or having a connection with the concept of shining/gleaming . He was regularly identified with Apollo as Apollo Grannus . He was frequently worshipped in conjunction with Sirona , and sometimes with Mars and other deities .",
  "/wiki/Beli_Mawr": "Beli Mawr ( Beli the Great ) was an ancestor figure in Middle Welsh literature and genealogies . He is the father of Cassivellaunus , Arianrhod , Lludd Llaw Eraint , Llefelys , and Afallach . In certain medieval genealogies he is listed as the husband of Anna , cousin of Mary , mother of Jesus . According to the Welsh Triads , Beli and D\u00f4n were the parents of Arianrhod , but the mother of Beli 's other children - and the father of D\u00f4n 's other children - is not mentioned in the medieval Welsh literature . Several royal lines in medieval Wales traced their ancestry to Beli . The Mabinogi names Penarddun as a daughter of Beli Mawr , but the genealogy is confused ; it is possible she was meant to be his sister rather than daughter .",
  "/wiki/Maponos": "In ancient Celtic religion , Maponos or Maponus ( Great Son ) is a god of youth known mainly in northern Britain but also in Gaul . In Roman Britain , he was equated with Apollo . The Welsh mythological figure Mabon ap Modron is apparently derived from Maponos , who by analogy we may suggest was the son of the mother-goddess Dea Matrona . The Irish god Aengus , also known as the Mac \u00d3g ( young son ) , is probably related to Maponos , as are the Arthurian characters Mabuz and Mabonagrain .",
  "/wiki/Mabon_ap_Modron": "Mabon ap Modron is a prominent figure from Welsh literature and mythology , the son of Modron and a member of Arthur 's war band . Both he and his mother were likely deities in origin , descending from a divine mother-son pair . His name is related to the Romano-British god Maponos , whose name means Great Son ; Modron , in turn , is likely related to the Gaulish goddess Dea Matrona . He is often equated with the Demetian hero Pryderi fab Pwyll , and may be associated with the minor Arthurian character Mabon fab Mellt .",
  "/wiki/Aengus": "In Irish mythology , Aengus or \u00d3engus , also called Mac ind \u00d3ic , is one of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann and probably originally a god associated with youth , love and poetic inspiration . The son of The Dagda and Boann , he is also known as Maccan \u00d3c ( the young boy or young son ) , and corresponds to the Welsh mythical figure Mabon and the Celtic god Maponos . He plays a central role in five myths reported by medieval Irish texts .",
  "/wiki/Br\u00e2n": "Br\u00e2n the Blessed ( Welsh : Bendigeidfran or Br\u00e2n Fendigaidd , literally Blessed Crow ) is a giant and king of Britain in Welsh mythology . He appears in several of the Welsh Triads , but his most significant role is in the Second Branch of the Mabinogi , Branwen ferch Ll\u0177r . He is a son of Ll\u0177r and Penarddun , and the brother of Br\u00e2nwen , Manawydan , Nisien and Efnysien . The name Br\u00e2n in Welsh is usually translated as crow or raven .",
  "/wiki/Victoria_(mythology)": "Victoria ( Latin pronunciation : [ w\u026ak\u02c8to\u02d0r\u026a.a ] ) , in ancient Roman religion , was the personified goddess of victory . She is the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Nike , and was associated with Bellona . She was adapted from the Sabine agricultural goddess Vacuna and had a temple on the Palatine Hill . The goddess Vica Pota was also sometimes identified with Victoria . Victoria is often described as a daughter of Pallas and Styx , and as a sister of Zelus , Kratos , and Bia .",
  "/wiki/Bodua": "Cathubodua ( Proto-Celtic : *Katu-bodw\u0101 , battle crow ) is the name of a Gaulish goddess inferred from a single inscription at Mieussy in Haute Savoie , eastern France , which actually reads ATHVBODVAE AVG SERVILIA TERENTIA S L M. The text 's restitution as Cathubodua depends on the assumptions that an initial C has been lost and that the personal names ATEBODVAE , ATEBODVVS and ATEBODVI in 3 other inscriptions in modern Austria and Slovenia are unrelated . She appears to be identical to the Irish goddess Badb Catha ; under this identification , Badb Catha would foresee the fate of warriors before the battle . Nicole Jufer and Thierry Luginb\u00fchl provisionally link Cathubodua with other apparently martial goddesses attested elsewhere , such as Boudina , Bodua , and Boudiga , whose names share roots meaning either 'fighting ' or 'victory ' . She would therefore be comparable to the Roman Victoria and the Greek goddess Nike and possibly the Nordic goddess Sigyn .",
  "/wiki/Badb": "In Irish mythology , the Badb ( Old Irish , pronounced [ \u02c8ba\u00f0\u03b2 ] ) or Badhbh ( Modern Irish , pronounced [ \u02c8b\u0259iv ] ) - meaning crow - is a war goddess who takes the form of a crow , and is thus sometimes known as Badb Catha ( battle crow ) . She is known to cause fear and confusion among soldiers to move the tide of battle to her favoured side . Badb may also appear prior to a battle to foreshadow the extent of the carnage to come , or to predict the death of a notable person . She would sometimes do this through wailing cries , leading to comparisons with the bean-s\u00eddhe ( banshee ) . With her sisters , Macha and Nemain or Anand , Badb is part of a trio of war goddesses known as the three Morr\u00edgna .",
  "/wiki/Brigantia_(goddess)": "Brigantia was a goddess in Celtic ( Gallo-Roman and Romano-British ) religion of Late Antiquity . Through interpretatio Romana , she was identified with the goddess Victoria . The tales connected to the characters of Brigid and Saint Brigid in Irish mythology and legend have been argued to be connected to Brigantia , although the figures themselves remain distinct .",
  "/wiki/Brigid": "Brigit , Brigid or Br\u00edg ( /\u02c8br\u026ad\u0292\u026ad , \u02c8bri\u02d0\u026ad/ , Old Irish Irish pronunciation : [ \u02c8b\u02b2\u027e\u02b2i\u029did\u02b2 ] ; meaning 'exalted one ' ) was a goddess of pre-Christian Ireland . She appears in Irish mythology as a member of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann , the daughter of the Dagda and wife of Bres , with whom she had a son named Ruad\u00e1n . It has been suggested that Brigid is a continuation of the Indo-European dawn goddess . She is associated with the spring season , fertility , healing , poetry and smithcraft . Cormac 's Glossary , written in the 10th century by Christian monks , says that Brigid was the goddess whom poets adored and that she had two sisters : Brigid the healer and Brigid the smith . This suggests she may have been a triple deity . Saint Brigid shares many of the goddess 's attributes and her feast day on 1 February was originally a pagan festival ( Imbolc ) marking the beginning of spring . It has thus been argued that the saint is a Christianization of the goddess .",
  "/wiki/Cicolluis": "Cicolluis or Cicoluis ( also known as Cicollus , Cicolus , Cicollui , and Cichol ) is a god in Celtic mythology worshiped by the ancient Gaulish peoples and having a parallel in Ireland . The name is Gaulish and means All-Breast or Great-Breasted and is probably used to signify strength . In the Gallo-Roman religion , Cicolluis is thought to be a common epithet for Gaulish Mars . A Latin dedicatory inscription from Narbonne ( which was in the far south of Gaul ) , France , bears the words MARTI CICOLLUI ET LITAVI ( Mars Cicolluis and Litavis ) . , Mars Cicolluis has dedications in Xanten , Germany , and Aignay-le-Duc ( where his consort is given as Litavis ) and M\u00e2lain ( where his consorts are given as Litavis and Bellona , Roman goddess and personification of war ) of the C\u00f4te-d'Or , France . Cicolluis is named alone ( not as an epithet of Mars ) in an inscription at Chassey , C\u00f4te-d'Or , Franche-Comt\u00e9 , France , and a partial inscription from Ruffey-l\u00e8s-Echirey , C\u00f4te-d'Or , France , may be dedicated to Cicolluis . In Windisch , Switzerland , he is known as Cicollus , and in Dijon , C\u00f4te-d'Or , France , he is known as Mars Cicoluis . Cicolluis may also be compared to Cichol or C\u00edocal Gricenchos , the earliest-mentioned leader of the Fomorians or Fom\u00f3iri ( the semi-divine initial inhabitants of Ireland ) in Irish mythology . According to the seventeenth-century Irish historian Seathr\u00fan C\u00e9itinn ( also known by the English name Geoffrey Keating ) , Cichol arrived in Ireland with fifty men and fifty women on six boats a hundred years after the Flood . There , his people lived on fish and fowl for two hundred years until Parthol\u00f3n and his people ( who brought the plough and oxen ) invaded and defeated the Fomorians in the Battle of Magh Ithe . Cicolluiss name is most likely derived from the reconstructed proto-Celtic roots *k-k\u0192 ( breast , but also yields the insular Celtic words for meat , such as Irish cich [ flesh ] ) , Welsh cig [ meat/flesh ] and *olyo- ( all , whole , or every ) ; this leads to the translation All-Breast or Great-Breasted . This likely epithet for strength might relate with Cichol as leader of the Fomorians . Therefore , Cicolluis may have been identified with the warrior aspect of Roman Mars and may have been a protective deity .",
  "/wiki/Cichol_Gricenchos": "In Irish mythology , Cichol or C\u00edocal Gricenchos is the earliest-mentioned leader of the Fomorians . His epithet , Gricenchos or Grigenchosach , is obscure . Macalister translates it as clapperleg ; Comyn as of withered feet . O'Donovan leaves it untranslated . According to the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn , he arrived in Ireland with 200 men and 600 women , who subsisted by fishing and fowling for 200 years until the arrival of Parthol\u00f3n , 311 years after the Flood , whose followers were the first to bring animal husbandry , the plough , houses and brewing to Ireland . Ten years later , Parthol\u00f3n defeated Cichol and the Fomorians in the Battle of Mag Itha .",
  "/wiki/Dionysus": "Dionysus or Dionysos [ a ] is the god of the grape-harvest , winemaking and wine , of fertility , ritual madness , religious ecstasy , and theatre in ancient Greek religion and myth . He is also known as Bacchus ( /\u02c8b\u00e6k\u0259s/ or /\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0k\u0259s/ ; Greek : \u0392\u03ac\u03ba\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 , B\u00e1kkhos ) , the name adopted by the Romans ; the frenzy he induces is bakkheia . His thyrsus , sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey , is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents . As Eleutherios ( the liberator ) , his wine , music and ecstatic dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care , and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful . Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself . In his religion , identical with or closely related to Orphism , Dionysus was believed to have been born from the union of Zeus and Persephone , and to have himself represented a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus . Many believed that he had been born twice , having been killed and reborn as the son of Zeus and the mortal Semele . In the Eleusinian Mysteries he was identified with Iacchus , the son ( or , alternately , husband ) of Demeter . His origins are uncertain , and his cults took many forms ; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian , others as Greek . Though most accounts say he was born in Thrace , traveled abroad , and arrived in Greece as a foreigner , evidence from the Mycenaean period of Greek history show that he is one of Greece 's oldest attested gods . His attribute of foreignness as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults , as he is a god of epiphany , sometimes called the god that comes . Wine played an important role in Greek culture , and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus surrounding its consumption .",
  "/wiki/Cernunnos": "Cernunnos is the conventional name given in Celtic studies to depictions of the horned god of Celtic polytheism . Over 50 examples of his imagery have been found from the Gallo-Roman period , mostly in north-eastern Gaul as well as among the Celtiberians . Cernunnos is depicted with antlers , seated cross-legged , and is associated with stags , horned serpents , dogs , bulls , and rats . He is usually holding or wearing a torc . Due to the lack of surviving literature , details about his name , his followers , or his significance in Celtic religion are unknown . Interpretations of his role vary from seeing him as a god of animals , nature and fertility to a god of travel , commerce and bi-directionality .",

Dis was originally associated with fertile agricultural land and mineral wealth , and since those minerals came from underground , he was later equated with the chthonic deities Pluto ( Hades ) and Orcus . D\u012bs Pater was commonly shortened to simply D\u012bs and this name has since become an alternative name for the underworld or a part of the underworld , such as the City of Dis of Dante 's The Divine Comedy , which comprises Lower Hell . It is often thought that D\u012bs Pater was also a Celtic god . This confusion arises from the second-hand citation of one of Julius Caesar 's comments in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars ( VI:18 ) , where he says that the Gauls all claimed descent from D\u012bs Pater . However , Caesar 's remark is a clear example of interpretatio Romana : what Caesar meant was that the Gauls all claimed descent from a Gaulish god that reminded him of the Roman D\u012bs Pater , a scholia on the Pharsalia equates Dis Pater with Taranis , the chief sky deity in the Gaulish religion . Different possible candidates exist for this role in Celtic religion , such as Gaulish Sucellus , Irish Donn and Welsh Beli Mawr , among others .",

Donn is said to dwell in Tech Duinn ( the house of Donn or house of the dark one ) , where the souls of the dead gather . He may have originally been an aspect of the Dagda . Folklore about Donn survived into the modern era in parts of Ireland , in which he is said to be a phantom horseman riding a white horse .",

It survives in three Old and Middle Irish recensions , it is part of the Book of Dun Cow . It recounts the birth , life , and death of Conaire M\u00f3r son of Etersc\u00e9l M\u00f3r , a legendary High King of Ireland , who is killed at Da Derga 's hostel by his enemies when he breaks his geasa . It is considered one of the finest Irish sagas of the early period , comparable to the better-known T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge . The theme of gathering doom , as the king is forced through circumstances to break one after another of his taboos , is non-Christian in essence , and no Christian interpretations are laid upon the marvels that it relates . In its repetitions and verbal formulas the poem retains the qualities of oral transmission . The tone of the work has been compared with Greek tragedy .",
  "/wiki/Epona": "In Gallo-Roman religion , Epona was a protector of horses , ponies , donkeys , and mules . She was particularly a goddess of fertility , as shown by her attributes of a patera , cornucopia , ears of grain and the presence of foals in some sculptures . She and her horses might also have been leaders of the soul in the after-life ride , with parallels in Rhiannon of the Mabinogion . The worship of Epona , the sole Celtic divinity ultimately worshipped in Rome itself , as the patroness of cavalry , was widespread in the Roman Empire between the first and third centuries AD ; this is unusual for a Celtic deity , most of whom were associated with specific localities .",
  "/wiki/Rhiannon": "Rhiannon is a major figure in the Mabinogi , the medieval Welsh story collection . She appears mainly in the First Branch of the Mabinogi , and again in the Third Branch . She is a strong-minded Otherworld woman , who chooses Pwyll , prince of Dyfed ( west Wales ) , as her consort , in preference to another man to whom she has already been betrothed . She is intelligent , politically strategic , beautiful , and famed for her wealth and generosity . With Pwyll she has a son , the hero Pryderi , who later inherits the lordship of Dyfed . She endures tragedy when her newborn child is abducted , and she is accused of infanticide . As a widow she marries Manawydan of the British royal family , and has further adventures involving enchantments . Like some other figures of British/Welsh literary tradition , Rhiannon may be a reflex of an earlier Celtic deity . Her name appears to derive from the reconstructed Brittonic form *R\u012bganton\u0101 , a derivative of *r\u012bgan- queen . In the First Branch of the Mabinogi , Rhiannon is strongly associated with horses , and so is her son Pryderi . She is often considered to be related to the Gaulish horse goddess Epona .

Several figures called Macha appear in Irish mythology and folklore , all believed to derive from the same goddess . She is said to be one of three sisters known as 'the three Morr\u00edgna ' . Like other sovereignty goddesses , Macha is associated with the land , fertility , kingship , war and horses . The name is presumably derived from Proto-Celtic *makaj\u0101 denoting a plain ( genitive *makaj\u0101s of the plain ) .

His name can be compared with the Old Irish gobae ( gen. gobann ) smith , Middle Welsh gof ( pl . gofein ) smith , Gaulish gobedbi with the smiths , all of which are cognate with Lithuanian gabija sacred home fire , gabus gifted , clever . His apparent counterpart in Irish mythology , Goibniu , in addition to his duties as a smith , also takes on the role of a divine hero who brewed an ale of immortality , in addition to being an architect and builder .

In the Greek-influenced tradition , Neptune is the brother of Jupiter and Pluto ; the brothers preside over the realms of Heaven , the earthly world , and the Underworld . Salacia is his wife . Depictions of Neptune in Roman mosaics , especially those of North Africa , are influenced by Hellenistic conventions . Neptune was likely associated with fresh water springs before the sea .

Hera also afflicted Lamia with sleeplessness so she would anguish constantly , but Zeus gave her the ability to remove her own eyes . Lamia was also used as a bogey word to frighten and discipline children . In later traditions and storytelling , the lamiai became a type of phantom , synonymous with the empusai which seduced youths to satisfy their sexual appetite and fed on their flesh afterward . A fabulous biography of Apollonius of Tyana defeating a lamia seductress has inspired the poem Lamia by Keats . The lamia has been ascribed serpentine qualities , which some commentators believe can be firmly traced to mythology from antiquity , and they have found analogues in ancient texts that could be designated as lamiai ( or lamiae ) which are part-serpent beings . These include the half-woman , half-snake beasts of the Libyan myth told by Dio Chrysostom , and the monster sent to Argos by Apollo to avenge Psamathe ( Crotopus ) .",

  "/wiki/Morr\u00edgan": "The Morr\u00edgan or M\u00f3rr\u00edgan , also known as Morr\u00edgu , is a figure from Irish mythology . The name is M\u00f3r-R\u00edoghain in Modern Irish . It has been translated as great queen or phantom queen . The Morr\u00edgan is mainly associated with war and fate , especially with foretelling doom , death or victory in battle . In this role she often appears as a crow , the badb . She incites warriors to battle and can help bring about victory over their enemies . The Morr\u00edgan encourages warriors to do brave deeds , strikes fear into their enemies , and is portrayed washing the bloodstained clothes of those fated to die . She is most frequently seen as a goddess of battle and war and has also been seen as a manifestation of the earth- and sovereignty-goddess , chiefly representing the goddess 's role as guardian of the territory and its people . The Morr\u00edgan is often described as a trio of individuals , all sisters , called the three Morr\u00edgna . Membership of the triad varies ; sometimes it is given as Badb , Macha and Nemain while elsewhere it is given as Badb , Macha and Anand ( the latter is given as another name for the Morr\u00edgan ) . It is believed that these were all names for the same goddess . The three Morr\u00edgna are also named as sisters of the three land goddesses \u00c9riu , Banba and F\u00f3dla .",
  "/wiki/Nemetona": "Nemetona , or 'she of the sacred grove ' , is a Celtic goddess with roots in northeastern Gaul . She is thought to have been the eponymous deity of the Germano-Celtic people known as the Nemetes ; evidence of her veneration is found in their former territory along the Middle Rhine as well in the Altbachtal sanctuary in present-day Trier , Germany . She is also attested in Bath , England , where an altar to her was dedicated by a man of the Gallic Treveri people . Her name is derived from the Celtic root nemeto- , referring to consecrated religious spaces , particularly sacred groves . She has thus been taken to be a guardian goddess of open-air places of worship . The same root is found in the names of the Romano-British goddess Arnemetia and the Matres Nemetiales ( known from an inscription in Grenoble ) . Surviving inscriptions often associate Nemetona with Mars ( sometimes given the Celtic name Loucetius ) . She is paired with Loucetius Mars in the inscription at Bath , and with Mars at Trier and Altrip . Separate inscriptions to Nemetona and to Loucetius have been recovered from the same site in Klein-Winternheim near Mainz . The Altrip site was further notable for yielding a terra cotta depiction of the goddess . One inscription from Eisenberg appears to identify Nemetona with Victoria :",
  "/wiki/Hercules": "Hercules ( /\u02c8h\u025c\u02d0rkjuli\u02d0z , -j\u0259-/ ) is a Roman hero and god . He was the Roman equivalent of the Greek divine hero Heracles , who was the son of Zeus ( Roman equivalent Jupiter ) and the mortal Alcmene . In classical mythology , Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures . The Romans adapted the Greek hero 's iconography and myths for their literature and art under the name Hercules . In later Western art and literature and in popular culture , Hercules is more commonly used than Heracles as the name of the hero . Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics , which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him . This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the later tradition .",

From the second century BC onward , the Romans equated her with the Greek goddess Athena , though the Romans did not stress her relation to battle and warfare as the Greeks did . Following the Greek myths around Athena , she was born of Metis , who had been swallowed by Jupiter , and burst from her father 's head , fully armed and clad in armor . Jupiter forcibly impregnated the titaness Metis , which resulted in her attempting to change shape ( or shapeshift ) to escape him . Jupiter then recalled the prophecy that his own child would overthrow him as he had Saturn , and in turn , Saturn had Caelus . Fearing that their child would be male , and would grow stronger than he was and rule the Heavens in his place , Jupiter swallowed Metis whole after tricking her into turning herself into a fly . The titaness gave birth to Minerva and forged weapons and armor for her child while within Jupiter 's body . In some versions of the story , Metis continued to live inside of Jupiter 's mind as the source of his wisdom . Others say she was simply a vessel for the birth of Minerva . The constant pounding and ringing left Jupiter with agonizing pain . To relieve the pain , Vulcan used a hammer to split Jupiter 's head and , from the cleft , Minerva emerged , whole , adult , and in full battle armor . She was the virgin goddess of music , poetry , medicine , wisdom , commerce , weaving , and the crafts .",

She is identified with Minerva in the interpretatio romana . The etymology of her name has been taken to translate to brightest one , i.e . containing a superlative suffix -isama attached to the root bel bright ; based on this she has also been speculatively claimed as companion of Belenus , whose name seems to contain the same root . But the root bel has also ( for either deity ) been interpreted differently , e.g . as bel strong .",
  "/wiki/Senuna": "Senuna was a Celtic goddess worshipped in Roman Britain . She was unknown until a cache of 26 votive offerings to her were discovered in 2002 in an undisclosed field at Ashwell End in Hertfordshire by metal detectorist Alan Meek . Her imagery shows evidence of syncretism between a pre-Roman goddess with the Roman Minerva ( for a parallel , cf . Sulis Minerva , the Romano-British goddess worshipped at Bath ) . Senuna 's shrine consisted of a ritual midden , onto which offerings were thrown , surrounded by a complex of buildings including workshops and accommodation for pilgrims . It was certainly no humble crossroads shrine . The dedicatory artefacts kept in the shrine were subsequently buried together on the edge of the midden , perhaps intended for temporary safe-keeping , in the late 3rd or 4th century CE .",

  "/wiki/Icovellauna": "Icovellauna was a Celtic goddess worshipped in Gaul . Her places of worship included an octagonal temple at Le Sablon in Metz , originally built over a spring , from which five inscriptions dedicated to her have been recovered ; and Trier , where Icovellauna was honoured in an inscription in the Altbachtal temple complex . [ A ] Both of these places lie in the valley of the Moselle river of eastern Gaul , in what are now Lorraine in France and Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany . One such inscription was , somewhat unusually , inscribed on a copper tablet in Roman cursive letters . At the temple in Metz , a spiral staircase led down to the water level , allowing worshippers to leave offerings in the spring and/or to take the waters . A statuette of a local Gaulish Mercury was among the ex-votos deposited at the shrine , which also included coins and ceramics dating from the 2nd to 4th centuries CE . Jeanne-Marie Demarolle states that Apollo was also associated with Icovellauna . Demarolle glosses the name Icovellauna as bonne fontaine or good fountain . Miranda Green follows Joseph Vendryes in interpreting the Gaulish root ico- as water and characterizes Icovellauna as a water-goddess who presided over the nymphaeum at Sablon in the Moselle Basin , a thermal spring-site . Xavier Delamarre , however , considers Vendryes ' interpretation to be very improbable ; on purely etymological grounds , he suggests that ico- might be the name of a bird , perhaps the woodpecker . The root uellauno- has been variously interpreted , though the interpretation chief , commander has recently found favour ; see Vellaunus .",

The springs , called the Fontes Sequanae ( The Springs of Sequana ) , are located in a valley in the Ch\u00e2tillon Plateau , to the north-west of Dijon in Burgundy , and it was here , in the 2nd or 1st century BC , that a healing shrine was established . The sanctuary was later taken over by the Romans , who built two temples , a colonnaded precinct and other related structures centred on the spring and pool . Many dedications were made to Sequana at her temple , including a large pot inscribed with her name and filled with bronze and silver models of parts of human bodies to be cured by her . Wooden and stone images of limbs , internal organs , heads , and complete bodies were offered to her in the hope of a cure , as well as numerous coins and items of jewellery . Respiratory illnesses and eye diseases were common . Pilgrims were frequently depicted as carrying offerings to the goddess , including money , fruit , or a favorite pet dog or bird .",
