  "/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio": "Dayton ( /\u02c8de\u026at\u0259n/ ) is the sixth-largest city in the state of Ohio and the county seat of Montgomery County . A small part of the city extends into Greene County . The 2018 U.S. census estimate put the city population at 140,640 , while Greater Dayton was estimated to be at 803,416 residents . This makes Dayton the fourth-largest metropolitan area in Ohio and 63rd in the United States . Dayton is within Ohio 's Miami Valley region , just north of Greater Cincinnati . Ohio 's borders are within 500 miles ( 800 km ) of roughly 60 percent of the country 's population and manufacturing infrastructure , making the Dayton area a logistical centroid for manufacturers , suppliers , and shippers . Dayton also hosts significant research and development in fields like industrial , aeronautical , and astronautical engineering that have led to many technological innovations . Much of this innovation is due in part to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and its place in the community . With the decline of heavy manufacturing , Dayton 's businesses have diversified into a service economy that includes insurance and legal sectors as well as healthcare and government sectors . Along with defense and aerospace , healthcare accounts for much of the Dayton area 's economy . Hospitals in the Greater Dayton area have an estimated combined employment of nearly 32,000 and a yearly economic impact of $ 6.8 billion . It is estimated that Premier Health Partners , a hospital network , contributes more than $ 2 billion a year to the region through operating , employment , and capital expenditures .",

A population of about 302,407 ( 2018 ) residents live within the city limits , making it the 66th-largest city in the U.S . The metropolitan population of 2,324,743 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia , the second-largest in Pennsylvania ( behind Philadelphia ) , and the 27th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is located in the southwest of the state , at the confluence of the Allegheny , Monongahela , and Ohio rivers . Pittsburgh is known both as the Steel City for its more than 300 steel-related businesses and as the City of Bridges for its 446 bridges . The city features 30 skyscrapers , two inclined railways , a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers . The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest , as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires , Virginians , Whiskey Rebels , and Civil War raiders . Aside from steel , Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum , glass , shipbuilding , petroleum , foods , sports , transportation , computing , autos , and electronics . For part of the 20th century , Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment ; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita . Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 80s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined , and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out . The population dropped from a peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990 . However , this rich industrial history left the area with renowned museums , medical centers , parks , research centers , and a diverse cultural district . After the deindustrialization of the mid-20th century , Pittsburgh has transformed into a hub for the health care , education , and technology industries .",
