  "/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War": "The Second Italo-Ethiopian War , also referred to as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War , was a colonial war which was fought between October 1935 and February 1937 . It is seen as an example of the expansionist policy that characterized the Axis powers and the inefficiency of the League of Nations before the outbreak of World War II . On 3 October 1935 one hundred thousand soldiers of the Italian Army commanded by Marshal Emilio De Bono attacked from Eritrea ( then an Italian colonial possession ) without prior declaration of war . At the same time a minor force under General Rodolfo Graziani attacked from Italian Somalia . On 6 October , Aduwa was conquered , a symbolic place for the Italian army . On 15 October , Italian troops seized Aksum , and the obelisk adorning the city was torn from its site and sent to Rome to be placed symbolically in front of the building of the Ministry of Colonies created by the fascist regime . Exasperated by De Bono 's slow and cautious progress , Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini put General Pietro Badoglio in his place . Ethiopian forces attacked the newly arrived invading army and launched a counterattack in December 1935 , but their rudimentary armed army could not resist well against the modern weapons of the Italians . Even the communications service of the Ethiopian forces depended on foot messengers , as they did not have radio devices . This was enough for the Italians to impose a narrow fence on Ethiopian detachments to leave them totally ignorant about the movements of their own army . Despite being allied with Italy , Nazi Germany sent arms and munitions to Ethiopia because it was frustrated over Italian objections to its policy towards Austria ; this prolonged the war and diverted Italian attention away from Austria . The Ethiopian counteroffensive managed to stop the Italian advance for a few weeks , but the superiority of the Italians ' weapons ( particularly heavy artillery and aviation ) prevented the Ethiopians from taking advantage of their initial successes .",
