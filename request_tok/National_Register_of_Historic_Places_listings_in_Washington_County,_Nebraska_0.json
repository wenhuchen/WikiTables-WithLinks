  "/wiki/DeSoto_National_Wildlife_Refuge": "DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge , created in 1958 , is located along the banks of the Missouri River in the U.S. states of Iowa and Nebraska . The 8,362-acre ( 33.83 km2 ) refuge ( 46% in Iowa , 54% in Nebraska ) preserves an area that would have been otherwise lost to cultivation . In 1960 , an Army Corps of Engineers channelization project on the Missouri River moved the main river channel in the area to the west . The former river channel became DeSoto Lake , a seven-mile long oxbow lake . As a result , part of the Nebraska portion of the refuge lies on the east side of the Missouri River . For over 20 years after construction , the lake was used for recreational boating , with half of the lake designated for watersports and the other half a no-wake zone for wildlife habitat and fishing . The lake was so popular that access was limited by the park 's rangers to keep the boat traffic down on the lake on Saturday and Sunday afternoons . The lake 's marina , snack bar , swimming area and boat ramps were all removed , and restrictions were placed on boat operation . Today , the refuge is home to around 30 mammal species , including white-tailed deer , beavers , opossums , raccoons , fox squirrels , muskrats and coyotes . Many bird species also inhabit the refuge , such as bald eagles , great blue herons , egrets , pelicans , turkeys and cardinals . The refuge is also a major stopover on the Central Flyway bird migration route ; the population of migratory birds increases substantially in the spring and fall months . The numbers of snow geese used to frequently be in the hundreds of thousands , but for unknown reasons has substantially dropped for only a few thousand a year ( not at once ) .",
