  "/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar": "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar FRS ( 19 October 1910 - 21 August 1995 ) was an American astrophysicist of Indian origin who spent his professional life in the United States . He was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics with William A. Fowler for .theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars . His mathematical treatment of stellar evolution yielded many of the current theoretical models of the later evolutionary stages of massive stars and black holes . The Chandrasekhar limit is named after him . Chandrasekhar worked on a wide variety of physical problems in his lifetime , contributing to the contemporary understanding of stellar structure , white dwarfs , stellar dynamics , stochastic process , radiative transfer , the quantum theory of the hydrogen anion , hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability , turbulence , equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium , general relativity , mathematical theory of black holes and theory of colliding gravitational waves . At the University of Cambridge , he developed a theoretical model explaining the structure of white dwarf stars that took into account the relativistic variation of mass with the velocities of electrons that comprise their degenerate matter . He showed that the mass of a white dwarf could not exceed 1.44 times that of the Sun - the Chandrasekhar limit . Chandrasekhar revised the models of stellar dynamics first outlined by Jan Oort and others by considering the effects of fluctuating gravitational fields within the Milky Way on stars rotating about the galactic centre . His solution to this complex dynamical problem involved a set of twenty partial differential equations , describing a new quantity he termed 'dynamical friction ' , which has the dual effects of decelerating the star and helping to stabilize clusters of stars . Chandrasekhar extended this analysis to the interstellar medium , showing that clouds of galactic gas and dust are distributed very unevenly . Chandrasekhar studied at Presidency College , Madras ( now Chennai ) and the University of Cambridge . A long-time professor at the University of Chicago , he did some of his studies at the Yerkes Observatory , and served as editor of The Astrophysical Journal from 1952 to 1971 .",
  "/wiki/James_Cronin": "James Watson Cronin ( September 29 , 1931 - August 25 , 2016 ) was an American particle physicist . Cronin was born in Chicago , Illinois , and attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas , Texas . He and co-researcher Val Logsdon Fitch were awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics for a 1964 experiment that proved that certain subatomic reactions do not adhere to fundamental symmetry principles . Specifically , they proved , by examining the decay of kaons , that a reaction run in reverse does not merely retrace the path of the original reaction , which showed that the interactions of subatomic particles are not invariant under time reversal . Thus the phenomenon of CP violation was discovered . Cronin received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1976 for major experimental contributions to particle physics including fundamental work on weak interactions culminating in the discovery of asymmetry under time reversal . In 1999 , he was awarded the National Medal of Science .

  "/wiki/Luis_Walter_Alvarez": "Luis Walter Alvarez ( June 13 , 1911 - September 1 , 1988 ) was an American experimental physicist , inventor , and professor who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968 for development of the hydrogen bubble chamber enabling discovery of resonance states in particle physics . The American Journal of Physics commented , Luis Alvarez was one of the most brilliant and productive experimental physicists of the twentieth century . After receiving his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1936 , Alvarez went to work for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California , Berkeley . Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei , predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed . He produced tritium using the cyclotron and measured its lifetime . In collaboration with Felix Bloch , he measured the magnetic moment of the neutron . In 1940 Alvarez joined the MIT Radiation Laboratory , where he contributed to a number of World War II radar projects , from early improvements to Identification friend or foe ( IFF ) radar beacons , now called transponders , to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars . Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge , escaping attack . But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub , the signal - as measured by the sub - got progressively weaker , and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and did n't submerge . The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has played a major role in aviation , most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift , was Ground Controlled Approach ( GCA ) . Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project . Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses , and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators .",

For most of his career , Bethe was a professor at Cornell University . During World War II , he was head of the Theoretical Division at the secret Los Alamos laboratory which developed the first atomic bombs . There he played a key role in calculating the critical mass of the weapons and developing the theory behind the implosion method used in both the Trinity test and the Fat Man weapon dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945 . After the war , Bethe also played an important role in the development of the hydrogen bomb , though he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made . Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race . He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign , respectively , the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ( SALT I ) . His scientific research never ceased and he was publishing papers well into his nineties , making him one of the few scientists to have published at least one major paper in his field during every decade of his career - which , in Bethe 's case , spanned nearly seventy years . Freeman Dyson , once one of his students , called him the supreme problem-solver of the 20th century .",
  "/wiki/Manhattan_Project": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons . It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada . From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $ 2 billion ( about $ 23 billion in 2018 dollars ) . Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada . Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war : a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon . The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium , and therefore a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235 , an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium . Chemically identical to the most common isotope , uranium-238 , and with almost the same mass , it proved difficult to separate the two .",
  "/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Metallurgical_Laboratory": "The Metallurgical Laboratory ( or Met Lab ) was a scientific laboratory at the University of Chicago that was established in February 1942 to study and use the newly discovered chemical element plutonium . It researched plutonium 's chemistry and metallurgy , designed the world 's first nuclear reactors to produce it , and developed chemical processes to separate it from other elements . In August 1942 the lab 's chemical section was the first to chemically separate a weighable sample of plutonium , and on 2 December 1942 , the Met Lab produced the first controlled nuclear chain reaction , in the reactor Chicago Pile-1 , which was constructed under the stands of the university 's old football stadium , Stagg Field . The Metallurgical Laboratory was established as part of the Metallurgical Project , also known as the Pile or X-10 Project , headed by Chicago professor Arthur H. Compton , a Nobel Prize laureate . In turn , this was part of the Manhattan Project - the Allied effort to develop the atomic bomb during World War II . The Metallurgical Laboratory was successively led by Richard L. Doan , Samuel K. Allison , Joyce C. Stearns and Farrington Daniels . Scientists who worked there included Enrico Fermi , James Franck , Eugene Wigner and Glenn Seaborg . At its peak on 1 July 1944 , it had 2,008 staff . Chicago Pile-1 was soon moved by the lab to a more remote site in the Argonne Forest , where its original materials were used to build an improved Chicago Pile-2 to be employed in new research into the products of nuclear fission . Another reactor , Chicago Pile-3 , was built at the Argonne site in early 1944 . This was the world 's first reactor to use heavy water as a neutron moderator . It went critical in May 1944 , and was first operated at full power in July 1944 .",

  "/wiki/Maria_Goeppert-Mayer": "Maria Goeppert Mayer ( June 28 , 1906 - February 20 , 1972 ) was a German-born American theoretical physicist , and Nobel laureate in Physics for proposing the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus . She was the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics , the first being Marie Curie . In 1986 , the Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award for early-career women physicists was established in her honor . A graduate of the University of G\u00f6ttingen , Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctoral thesis on the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms . At the time , the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote , but the development of the laser permitted this . Today , the unit for the two-photon absorption cross section is named the Goeppert Mayer ( GM ) unit . Maria Goeppert married Joseph Edward Mayer and moved to the United States , where he was an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University . Strict rules against nepotism prevented Johns Hopkins University from taking her on as a faculty member , but she was given a job as an assistant and published a landmark paper on double beta decay in 1935 . In 1937 , she moved to Columbia University , where she took an unpaid position . During World War II , she worked for the Manhattan Project at Columbia on isotope separation , and with Edward Teller at the Los Alamos Laboratory on the development of the Teller 's Super bomb . After the war , Goeppert Mayer became a voluntary associate professor of Physics at the University of Chicago ( where Teller and her husband worked ) and a senior physicist at the university-run Argonne National Laboratory . She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells , for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 , which she shared with J. Hans D. Jensen and Eugene Wigner ."
