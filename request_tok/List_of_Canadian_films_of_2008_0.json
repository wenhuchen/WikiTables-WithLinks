  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

  "/wiki/Inuit": "Inuit ( /\u02c8\u026anju\u026at/ ; syllabics : \u1403\u14c4\u1403\u1466 , the people , singular : Inuk \u1403\u14c4\u1483 , dual : Inuuk \u1403\u14c5\u1483 [ failed verification ] ) are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland , Canada and Alaska ( United States ) . The Inuit languages are part of the Eskimo-Aleut family . Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate used in Nunavut . Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut , Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec , Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut in Labrador , and in various parts of the Northwest Territories , particularly around the Arctic Ocean , in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region . [ note 1 ] With the exception of NunatuKavut these areas are known in the Inuit languages as Inuit Nunangat . In Canada , sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classify Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the M\u00e9tis . The Greenlandic Inuit are descendants of ancient indigenous migrations from Canada , as these people migrated to the east through the continent . Inuit of Denmark are Danish citizens , although not the citizens of the European Union . In the United States , the Alaskan I\u00f1upiat , live primarily on the Alaska North Slope and on Little Diomede Island . In Canada and the United States , the term Eskimo was commonly used to describe Inuit , and Siberia and Alaska 's Yupik , I\u00f1upiat , and Chukchi people . However , Inuit is not accepted as a term for the Yupik and Chukchi , and Eskimo is the only term that applies to Yupik , Chukchi , I\u00f1upiat and Inuit . Since the late 20th century , Indigenous peoples in Canada and Greenlandic Inuit consider Eskimo to be a pejorative term , and they more frequently identify as Inuit for an autonym .",
  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance : a play , opera , mime , ballet , etc. , performed in a theatre , or on radio or television . Considered as a genre of poetry in general , the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle 's Poetics ( c. 335 BC ) - the earliest work of dramatic theory . The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 , drama ) , which is derived from I do ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 , drao ) . The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy . In English ( as was the analogous case in many other European languages ) , the word play or game ( translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus ) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare 's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre . The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era . Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example , Zola 's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin ( 1873 ) or Chekhov 's Ivanov ( 1887 ) . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media . The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance . May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . The enactment of drama in theatre , performed by actors on a stage before an audience , presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception . The structure of dramatic texts , unlike other forms of literature , is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception .",

One of the oldest genres in film - and derived from the classical comedy in theatre - , some of the very first silent movies were comedies , as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions , without requiring sound . When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s , comedy films took another swing , as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue . Comedy , compared with other film genres , puts much more focus on individual stars , with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity .
