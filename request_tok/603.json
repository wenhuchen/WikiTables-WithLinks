East Thrace , the part of Turkey in Europe , is separated from Anatolia by the Sea of Marmara , the Bosporus and the Dardanelles ( collectively called the Turkish Straits ) . Istanbul , mostly located on the European side , is the largest city in the country while Ankara is the capital . Turkey is bordered by Greece and Bulgaria to its northwest , the Black Sea to its north , Georgia to its northeast , Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to its east , Iraq and Syria to its southeast , the Mediterranean Sea to its south , and the Aegean Sea to its west . Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",

[ ii ] The entirety of territory claimed by the State of Palestine has been occupied since 1948 , first by Egypt and Jordan and then by Israel after the Six-Day War in 1967 . Palestine has a population of 5,051,953 as of February 2020 , ranked 121st in the world . After World War II , in 1947 , the UN adopted a Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine recommending the creation of independent Arab and Jewish states and an internationalized Jerusalem . After the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel , to be known as the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 , neighboring Arab armies invaded the former British mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces . Later , the All-Palestine Government was established by the Arab League on 22 September 1948 to govern the Egyptian-controlled enclave in Gaza . It was soon recognized by all Arab League members except Transjordan . Though jurisdiction of the Government was declared to cover the whole of the former Mandatory Palestine , its effective jurisdiction was limited to the Gaza Strip . Israel later captured the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt , the West Bank ( including East Jerusalem ) from Jordan , and the Golan Heights from Syria in June 1967 following the Six-Day War . On 15 November 1988 , Yasser Arafat , Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , in Algiers proclaimed the establishment of the State of Palestine . A year after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993 , the Palestinian National Authority was formed to govern the areas A and B in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Gaza would later be ruled by Hamas in 2007 , two years after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza .",
  "/wiki/Shahid": "Shahid , or Shaheed ( Arabic : \u0634\u0647\u064a\u062f \u0161ah\u012bd , plural : \u0634\u064f\u0647\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0621 \u0161uhad\u0101\u02be ; female : \u0161ah\u012bda ) , originates from the Quranic Arabic word meaning witness and is also used to denote a martyr in Islam . The word shahid in Arabic means witness . Its development closely parallels that of Greek martys ( Greek : \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2 - witness , in the New Testament also martyr ) , the origin of the term martyr . Shahid occurs frequently in the Quran in the generic sense witness , but only once in the sense martyr ; one who dies for his faith ; this latter sense acquires wider use in the hadiths . The term is commonly used as a posthumous title for those who are considered to have accepted or even consciously sought out their own death in order to bear witness to their Islamic beliefs . Like the English word martyr , in the 20th century , the word shahid has come to have both religious and non-religious connotations , and has often been used to describe those who have died for non-religious ideological causes . This suggests that there is no single fixed and immutable concept of martyrdom in the Muslim world .",

Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south ; [ b ] Iran to the west ; Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan to the north ; and China to the northeast . Occupying 652,000 square kilometers ( 252,000 sq mi ) , it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest . Kabul is the capital and largest city . The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries . The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires . The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century . In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire . Its border with British India , the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter 's independence in 1947 . Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence , eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan , until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established .",
