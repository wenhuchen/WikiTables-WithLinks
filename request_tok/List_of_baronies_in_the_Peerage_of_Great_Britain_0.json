  "/wiki/Peerage_of_Scotland": "The Peerage of Scotland ( Scottish Gaelic : Moraireachd na h-Alba , Scots : Peerage o Scotland ) is the section of the Peerage of the British Isles for those peers created by the King of Scots before 1707 . Following that year 's Treaty of Union , the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England were combined under the name of Great Britain , and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created . After the Union , the Peers of the ancient Parliament of Scotland elected 16 representative peers to sit in the House of Lords . The Peerage Act 1963 granted all Scottish Peers the right to sit in the House of Lords , but this automatic right was revoked , as for all hereditary peerages ( except those of the incumbent Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain ) , when the House of Lords Act 1999 received royal assent . Had the Scottish people voted Yes in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum , the eligibility of Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords would have been reviewed . Unlike most peerages , many Scottish titles have been granted with remainder to pass via female offspring ( thus an Italian family has succeeded to and presently holds the earldom of Newburgh ) , and in the case of daughters only , these titles devolve to the eldest daughter rather than falling into abeyance ( as is the case with ancient English baronies by writ of summons ) . Unlike other British peerage titles , Scots Law permits peerages to be inherited by or through a person who was not legitimate at birth , but was subsequently legitimised by their parents marrying later . The ranks of the Scottish Peerage are , in ascending order : Lord of Parliament , Viscount , Earl , Marquis and Duke . Scottish Viscounts differ from those of the other Peerages ( of England , Great Britain , Ireland and the United Kingdom ) by using the style of in their title , as in Viscount of Oxfuird . Though this is the theoretical form , most Viscounts drop the of . The Viscount of Arbuthnott and to a lesser extent the Viscount of Oxfuird still use of .

  "/wiki/Duke_of_Buccleuch": "The title Duke of Buccleuch /b\u0259\u02c8klu\u02d0/ , formerly also spelt Duke of Buccleugh , is a title in the Peerage of Scotland created twice on 20 April 1663 , first for James Scott , 1st Duke of Monmouth and second suo jure for his wife Anne Scott , 4th Countess of Buccleuch . Monmouth , the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II was attainted after his 1685 rebellion , but his wife 's title was unaffected and passed on to their descendants , who have successively borne the surnames Scott , Montagu-Scott , Montagu Douglas Scott and Scott again . In 1810 , the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch inherited the Dukedom of Queensberry , also in the Peerage of Scotland , thus separating that title from the Marquessate of Queensberry . The substantial origin of the ducal house of the Scotts of Buccleuch dates back to the large grants of lands in Scotland to Sir Walter Scott of Kirkurd and Buccleuch , a border chief , by James II , in consequence of the fall of William Douglas , 8th Earl of Douglas ( 1452 ) , but the family traced their descent back to a Sir Richard le Scott ( 1240-1285 ) . Sir Walter Scott of Branxholme and Buccleuch ( died 1552 ) distinguished himself at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh ( 1547 ) . His great-grandson Sir Walter was created Lord Scott of Buccleuch in 1606 . Other subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Buccleuch are : Earl of Buccleuch ( 1619 ) , Earl of Dalkeith ( 1663 ) and Lord Scott of Whitchester and Eskdaill ( 1619 ) ( all in the Peerage of Scotland ) . The Duke also holds the two subsidiary titles of the attainted Dukedom of Monmouth , namely Earl of Doncaster ( 1663 ) and Baron Scott of Tindale ( 1663 ) ( both in the Peerage of England ) , and several subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Queensberry , namely Marquess of Dumfriesshire ( 1683 ) , Earl of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar ( 1682 ) , Viscount of Nith , Tortholwald and Ross ( 1682 ) and Lord Douglas of Kilmount , Middlebie and Dornock ( 1682 ) ( all in the Peerage of Scotland ) . The Earldom of Doncaster and Barony of Scott of Tindale had been forfeit at the time of the first Duke 's attainder , but the titles were restored to the 2nd Duke of Buccleuch in 1742 . Until 1835 , the Dukes also held lands in the West Riding of Yorkshire and the ancient title of Lord of Bowland . The Duke of Buccleuch is the hereditary chief of Clan Scott . The holder is one of only five people in the UK to hold two or more different dukedoms , the others being the Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay , the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon , the Duke of Argyll ( who holds two dukedoms named Argyll ) , and the Duke of Richmond , Lennox and Gordon .",

  "/wiki/Baron_Bingley": "Baron Bingley is a title that has been created three times , twice in the Peerage of Great Britain and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom . The first creation came in 1713 in the Peerage of Great Britain , when the former Chancellor of the Exchequer , Robert Benson , was made Baron Bingley , of Bingley in the County of York . He had no sons and the title became extinct on his death in 1731 . However , the title was revived in 1762 for his son-in-law , George Fox-Lane , who was also created Baron Bingley , of Bingley in the County of York , with remainder only to his heirs male with his wife , Harriet ( daughter of the first Baron of the 1713 creation ) . Born George Fox , he was the son of Henry Fox and the Hon . Frances , daughter of George Lane , 1st Viscount Lanesborough ( see Viscount Lanesborough ) , and assumed in 1751 by Act of Parliament the additional surname of Lane . Before his elevation to the peerage he had represented Hedon and York in the House of Commons . His son and heir , the Honourable Robert Fox-Lane , Member of Parliament for York , predeceased him in 1768 and the barony consequently became extinct on Lord Bingley 's death in 1773 . The most recent creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1933 , when the Conservative politician George Lane-Fox , was created Baron Bingley , of Bramham in the County of York . He was the great-great-grandson of James Fox-Lane , a nephew of the first Baron of the second creation , and was a former Member of Parliament for Barkston Ash . Lord Bingley had four daughters but no sons and on his death in 1947 , this title also became extinct ."
