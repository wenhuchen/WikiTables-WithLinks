An American column marched from Fort George and attempted to surprise a British outpost at Beaver Dams , billeting themselves overnight in the village of Queenston , Ontario . Laura Secord , a resident of Queenston , had earlier learned of the American plans , and had struck out on a long and difficult trek to warn the British at Decou 's stone house near present-day Brock University . When the Americans resumed their march , they were ambushed by Native warriors and eventually surrendered to a small British detachment led by Lieutenant James FitzGibbon .

  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",
  "/wiki/Laura_Secord": "Laura Secord ( n\u00e9e Ingersoll ; 13 September 1775 - 17 October 1868 ) was a Canadian heroine of the War of 1812 . She is known for having walked 20 miles ( 32 km ) out of American-occupied territory in 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack . Her contribution to the war was little known during her lifetime , but since her death she has been frequently honoured in Canada . Though Laura Secord had no relation to it , most Canadians associate her with the Laura Secord Chocolates company , named after her on the centennial of her walk . Laura Secord 's father , Thomas Ingersoll , lived in Massachusetts and fought on the side of the Patriots during the Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) . In 1795 he moved his family to the Niagara region of Upper Canada after he had applied for and received a land grant . Shortly after , Laura married Loyalist James Secord , who was later seriously wounded at the Battle of Queenston Heights early in the War of 1812 . While he was still recovering in 1813 , the Americans invaded the Niagara Peninsula , including Queenston . During the occupation , Secord acquired information about a planned American attack , and stole away on the morning of 22 June to inform Lieutenant James FitzGibbon in the territory still controlled by the British . The information helped the British and their Mohawk warrior allies repel the invading Americans at the Battle of Beaver Dams . Her effort was forgotten until 1860 , when Edward , Prince of Wales awarded the impoverished widow \u00a3100 for her service on his visit to Canada . The story of Laura Secord has taken on mythic overtones in Canada .",

  "/wiki/Upper_Canada": "The Province of Upper Canada ( French : province du Haut-Canada ) was a part of British Canada established in 1791 by the Kingdom of Great Britain , to govern the central third of the lands in British North America , formerly part of the Province of Quebec since 1763 . Upper Canada included all of modern-day Southern Ontario and all those areas of Northern Ontario in the Pays d'en Haut which had formed part of New France , essentially the watersheds of the Ottawa River or Lakes Huron and Superior , excluding any lands within the watershed of Hudson Bay . The upper prefix in the name reflects its geographic position along the Great Lakes , mostly above the headwaters of the Saint Lawrence River , contrasted with Lower Canada ( present-day Quebec ) to the northeast . It was the primary destination of Loyalist refugees and settlers from the United States after the American Revolution , who often were granted land to settle in Upper Canada . The province was characterized by its British way of life , including bicameral parliament and separate civil and criminal law , rather than mixed as in Lower Canada or elsewhere in the British Empire . The division was created to ensure the exercise of the same rights and privileges enjoyed by loyal subjects elsewhere in the North American colonies . In 1812 , war broke out between Great Britain and the United States , leading to several battles in Upper Canada . The US had hoped to capture Upper Canada , but the war ended with the situation unchanged . The government of the colony came to be dominated by a small group of persons , known as the Family Compact , who held most of the top positions in the Legislative Council and appointed officials . In 1837 , an unsuccessful rebellion attempted to overthrow the undemocratic system . Representative government would be established in the 1840s .

  "/wiki/Fortification": "A fortification is a military construction or building designed for the defense of territories in warfare , and is also used to solidify rule in a region during peacetime . The term is derived from the Latin fortis ( strong ) and facere ( to make ) . From very early history to modern times , defensive walls have often been necessary for cities to survive in an ever-changing world of invasion and conquest . Some settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization were the first small cities to be fortified . In ancient Greece , large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of Mycenae ( famous for the huge stone blocks of its 'cyclopean ' walls ) . A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison , and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or English fortress . These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower , to guard certain roads , passes , and borders . Though smaller than a real fortress , they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border . The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called castrametation since the time of the Roman legions . Fortification is usually divided into two branches : permanent fortification and field fortification . There is also an intermediate branch known as semi-permanent fortification . Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory .",
  "/wiki/Seven_Years'_War": "The Seven Years ' War was a global war fought between 1756 and 1763 . It involved all five European great powers of the time plus many of the middle powers and spanned five continents , affecting Europe , the Americas , West Africa , India , and the Philippines . The conflict split Europe into two coalitions : one was led by the Kingdom of Great Britain and included the Kingdom of Prussia , the Kingdom of Portugal , the Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( also named Hanover ) , and a few other small German states ; while the other was led by the Kingdom of France and included the Austrian-led Holy Roman Empire , including the Electorate of Saxony and most of the smaller German states , the Russian Empire ( until 1762 ) , the Kingdom of Spain , and Sweden . The Dutch Republic , Denmark-Norway , the Italian States , and the Ottoman Empire did not participate . Meanwhile , in India , some regional polities within the increasingly fragmented Mughal Empire , with the support of the French , failed to defeat a British attempt to conquer Bengal . Although Anglo-French skirmishes over their American colonies had begun in 1754 , with what became known in the United States as the French and Indian War , the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centered on Austria 's desire to recover Silesia from Prussia . Seeing the opportunity to curtail Britain 's and Prussia 's ever-growing might , France and Austria put aside their ancient rivalry to form a grand coalition of their own , bringing most of the other European powers to their side . Faced with this sudden turn of events , Britain aligned itself with Prussia , in a series of political manoeuvres known as the Diplomatic Revolution . However , French efforts ended in failure when the Anglo-Prussian coalition prevailed , and Britain 's rise as among the world 's predominant powers destroyed France 's supremacy in Europe , thus altering the European balance of power .",

It forms part of the border between the province of Ontario in Canada ( on the west ) and the state of New York in the United States ( on the east ) . There are differing theories as to the origin of the river 's name . According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger , Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the locally residing native Neutral Confederacy , who are described as being called the Niagagarega people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area . According to George R. Stewart , it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Ongniaahra , meaning point of land cut in two . The river , which is occasionally described as a strait , is about 58 kilometres ( 36 mi ) long and includes Niagara Falls in its course . The falls have moved approximately 11 kilometres ( 6.8 mi ) upstream from the Niagara Escarpment in the last 12,000 years , resulting in a gorge below the falls . Today , the diversion of the river for electrical generation has significantly reduced the rate of erosion . The total drop in elevation along the river is 99 metres ( 325 ft ) . The Niagara Gorge extends downstream from the Falls and includes the Niagara Whirlpool and another section of rapids . Power plants on the river include the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Stations ( built in 1922 and 1954 ) on the Canadian side , and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant ( built in 1961 ) on the American side .

Lake Superior is the second-largest lake in the world by area , and the largest freshwater lake by area . Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country . The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around 14,000 years ago , as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater .

It was designated a national historic site in 1921 in recognition of its role in shipbuilding and the location of the short-lived Republic of Canada . The site is closed to the public , has no visitor facilities , and has not allowed camping since the expiration of a lease with the Niagara Parks Commission .",
  "/wiki/Archaeological_site": "An archaeological site is a place ( or group of physical sites ) in which evidence of past activity is preserved ( either prehistoric or historic or contemporary ) , and which has been , or may be , investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record . Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground , to buildings and other structures still in use . Beyond this , the definition and geographical extent of a site can vary widely , depending on the period studied and the theoretical approach of the archaeologist .",
  "/wiki/Shipyard": "A shipyard ( also called a dockyard ) is a place where ships are built and repaired . These can be yachts , military vessels , cruise liners or other cargo or passenger ships . Dockyards are sometimes more associated with maintenance and basing activities than shipyards , which are sometimes associated more with initial construction . The terms are routinely used interchangeably , in part because the evolution of dockyards and shipyards has often caused them to change or merge roles . Countries with large shipbuilding industries include Australia , Brazil , China , Croatia , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , India , Ireland , Italy , Japan , the Netherlands , Norway , the Philippines , Poland , Romania , Russia , Singapore , South Korea , Sweden , Taiwan , Ukraine , the United Kingdom , the USA and Vietnam . The shipbuilding industry is more fragmented in Europe than in Asia where countries tend to have fewer , larger companies . Many naval vessels are built or maintained in shipyards owned or operated by the national government or navy . Shipyards are constructed near the sea or tidal rivers to allow easy access for their ships . The United Kingdom , for example , has shipyards on many of its rivers . The site of a large shipyard will contain many specialised cranes , dry docks , slipways , dust-free warehouses , painting facilities and extremely large areas for fabrication of the ships . After a ship 's useful life is over , it makes its final voyage to a shipbreaking yard , often on a beach in South Asia . Historically shipbreaking was carried on in drydock in developed countries , but high wages and environmental regulations have resulted in movement of the industry to developing regions .",
  "/wiki/Upper_Canada_Rebellion": "The Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the perceived oligarchic government of the British colony of Upper Canada ( present-day Ontario ) in December 1837 . While public grievances had existed for years , it was the rebellion in Lower Canada ( present-day Quebec ) , which started the previous month , that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt . The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began , although resistance lingered until 1838 ( and became more violent ) - mainly through the support of the Hunters ' Lodges , a secret anti-British , US-based militia that emerged around the Great Lakes , and launched the Patriot War in 1838-39 . Some historians suggest that although they were not as directly successful or as large , that the rebellions in 1837 should be viewed in the wider context of the late 18th and early 19th century Atlantic revolutions including the American Revolutionary War in 1776 , the French Revolution of 1789-1799 , the Haitian Revolution of 1791-1804 , the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , and the independence struggles of Spanish America ( 1810-1825 ) . While these rebellions differed in that they also struggled for republicanism , they were inspired by similar social problems stemming from poorly regulated oligarchies , and sought the same democratic ideals , which were also shared by the United Kingdom 's Chartists . The rebellion led directly to Lord Durham 's Report on the Affairs of British North America , and to The British North America Act , 1840 , which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system , leading to the formation of Canada as a nation in 1867 .",
  "/wiki/William_Lyon_Mackenzie": "William Lyon Mackenzie ( March 12 , 1795 - August 28 , 1861 ) was a Scottish-born Canadian-American journalist and politician . His strong views on political equality and clean government drove him to outright rebellion in 1837 after a career as mayor of Toronto and in the colonial legislative assembly of Upper Canada ( Ontario ) . He led the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion and during its bitter end he set up a small rebel enclave named Republic of Canada , where he served as president December 13 , 1837 to January 14 , 1838 . After a period of exile in the U.S. , he returned to Canada and served as elected member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada from 1851 to 1858 .",

  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",
  "/wiki/Apothecary": "Apothecary ( /\u0259\u02c8p\u0252\u03b8\u026ak\u0259ri/ ) is one term for a medical professional who formulates and dispenses materia medica ( medicine ) to physicians , surgeons , and patients . The modern pharmacist ( also colloquially referred to as a chemist in British English ) has taken over this role . In some languages and regions , the word apothecary is still used to refer to a retail pharmacy or a pharmacist who owns one . Apothecaries ' investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients was a precursor to the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology . In addition to dispensing herbs and medicine , the apothecary offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed by other specialist practitioners , such as surgeons and obstetricians . Apothecary shops sold ingredients and the medicines they prepared wholesale to other medical practitioners , as well as dispensing them to patients . In seventeenth century England , they also controlled the trade of tobacco which was imported as a medicine .",
  "/wiki/Niagara_District_Court_House": "Niagara District Court House , better known as the Court House Theatre , is a former court house and venue for the Shaw Festival ( until 1973 ) in Niagara-on-the-Lake , Ontario , Canada . The neo-classical three-storey building was constructed between 1846 and 1847 to designs by the Toronto architect William Thomas ( and built by Garvie and Co. ) for the then Niagara District . The building replaced an earlier court house removed for fear of it being in-range of cannon fire from Fort Niagara . Inside it had a courtroom , town hall chambers , offices and jail cells . The building was used as one of a few venues for the 1850 Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West . The court-house function remained until judicial courts moved to St. Catharines in 1863 ; the building then served as town hall and jail until 1866 . It became an orphanage for girls from England from 1869 to the early 20th century . In 1962 the court house became home to the Shaw Festival . It received designation as a National Historic Site in 1981 . As of the 2018 season , it was retired as an active performance venue and re-purposed for rehearsals , training , education , and expanded audience programs .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/United_Empire_Loyalist": "United Empire Loyalists ( or simply Loyalists ) is an honorific which was first given by the 1st Lord Dorchester , the Governor of Quebec , and Governor-General of the Canadas , to American Loyalists who resettled in British North America during or after the American Revolution . At the time , the 'Demonym Canadian ' or Canadien was used to refer to the indigenous First Nations groups and the French settlers inhabiting the Province of Quebec . They settled primarily in Nova Scotia and the Lower Canada ( now called Province of Quebec ) ( including the Eastern Townships , and Montreal ) . The influx of loyalist settlers resulted in the creation of several new colonies . In 1784 , New Brunswick was partitioned from the Colony of Nova Scotia after significant loyalist resettlement around the Bay of Fundy . The influx of loyalist refugees also resulted in the Province of Quebec 's division into Lower Canada ( present-day Quebec ) , and Upper Canada ( present-day Ontario ) in 1791 . The Crown gave them land grants of one Lot . One Lot contains 200 acres ( 81 ha ) per person to encourage their resettlement , as it especially wanted to develop the frontier of Upper Canada . This resettlement added many English speakers to the Canadian population . It was the beginning of new waves of immigration that established a predominantly English-speaking population in the future Canada both west and east of the modern Quebec border .",

It is surrounded on the north , west , and southwest by the Canadian province of Ontario , and on the south and east by the American state of New York , whose water boundaries meet in the middle of the lake . Ontario , Canada 's most populous province , was named for the lake . Many of Ontario 's most populous cities , including Toronto , Canada 's most populous city , and Hamilton , are on the lake 's northern and western shores respectively . In the Huron language , the name Ontar\u00ed'io means great lake . Its primary inlet is the Niagara River from Lake Erie .

  "/wiki/City_block": "A city block , urban block or simply block is a central element of urban planning and urban design . A city block is the smallest area that is surrounded by streets . City blocks are the space for buildings within the street pattern of a city , and form the basic unit of a city 's urban fabric . City blocks may be subdivided into any number of smaller land lots usually in private ownership , though in some cases , it may be other forms of tenure . City blocks are usually built-up to varying degrees and thus form the physical containers or 'streetwalls ' of public space . Most cities are composed of a greater or lesser variety of sizes and shapes of urban block . For example , many pre-industrial cores of cities in Europe , Asia , and the Middle East tend to have irregularly shaped street patterns and urban blocks , while cities based on grids have much more regular arrangements .",

The Greek Revival white square tower with red accents is attached to the fog alarm building , and a lighthouse keeper 's residence is located on the shore to the north . The site was considered for a lighthouse as early as 1855 by a United States lighthouse inspector , but its shoal was only marked by buoys until 1912 , when the Buffalo Lightship was installed nearby . The lightship sank as a result of the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 , and four years later the Canadian government commissioned the construction of the tower citing increased traffic at the eastern end of Lake Erie .",

  "/wiki/Lake_Erie": "Lake Erie /\u02c8\u026a\u0259ri/ ( French : Lac \u00c9ri\u00e9 ) is the fourth-largest lake ( by surface area ) of the five Great Lakes in North America , and the eleventh-largest globally if measured in terms of surface area . It is the southernmost , shallowest , and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time . At its deepest point Lake Erie is 210 feet ( 64 metres ) deep . Situated on the International Boundary between Canada and the United States , Lake Erie 's northern shore is the Canadian province of Ontario , specifically the Ontario Peninsula , with the U.S. states of Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York on its western , southern , and eastern shores . These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries . The lake was named by the Erie people , a Native American people who lived along its southern shore . The tribal name erie is a shortened form of the Iroquoian word erielhonan , meaning long tail . Situated below Lake Huron , Erie 's primary inlet is the Detroit River . The main natural outflow from the lake is via the Niagara River , which provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U.S. as it spins huge turbines near Niagara Falls at Lewiston , New York and Queenston , Ontario . Some outflow occurs via the Welland Canal , part of the St. Lawrence Seaway , which diverts water for ship passages from Port Colborne , Ontario on Lake Erie , to St. Catharines on Lake Ontario , an elevation difference of 326 ft ( 99 m ) . Lake Erie 's environmental health has been an ongoing concern for decades , with issues such as overfishing , pollution , algae blooms , and eutrophication generating headlines .",
  "/wiki/Queenston_Heights": "The Queenston Heights is a geographical feature of the Niagara Escarpment immediately above the village of Queenston , Ontario , Canada . Its geography is a promontory formed where the escarpment is divided by the Niagara River . The promontory forms a cliff face of approximately 100 m ( approximately 300 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Promontory": "A promontory is a raised mass of land that projects into a lowland or a body of water ( in which case it is a peninsula ) . Most promontories either are formed from a hard ridge of rock that has resisted the erosive forces that have removed the softer rock to the sides of it , or are the high ground that remains between two river valleys where they form a confluence . Throughout history many forts and castles have been built on promontories because of their inherent defensibility . The promontory forts in Ireland are examples of this . Similarly , the ancient town of Ras Bar Balla in southern Somalia , which in the Middle Ages was part of the Ajuran Sultanate 's domain , was built on a small promontory . River confluences consistently provide an added defensive advantage to promontories , acting as a reliable natural moat for the enemy to overcome . The Citadel of Namur , a prime fortified location from the 10th century to this day , lies on the promontory at the confluence of the Meuse and Sambre rivers in the Walloon capital city of Namur , Belgium . Another good example of a confluence promontory fort is Fort Pitt , an English fort during the American Revolution that had previously belonged to the French as Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War . The surrounding location is known as the city of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .",
  "/wiki/Niagara_Escarpment": "The Niagara Escarpment is a long escarpment , or cuesta , in the United States and Canada that runs predominantly east/west from New York , through Ontario , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Illinois . The escarpment is most famous as the cliff over which the Niagara River plunges at Niagara Falls , for which it is named . The Escarpment is a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve . It has the oldest forest ecosystem and trees in eastern North America . The Escarpment is composed of the Lockport Formation of Silurian age , and is similar to the Onondaga Formation , which runs parallel to it and just to the south , through western New York and southern Ontario . The Escarpment is the most prominent of several escarpments formed in the bedrock of the Great Lakes Basin . From its easternmost point near Watertown , New York , the escarpment shapes in part the individual basins and landforms of Lakes Ontario , Huron , and Michigan . In Rochester , New York , three waterfalls over the escarpment are where the Genesee River flows through the city . The escarpment thence runs westward to the Niagara River , forming a deep gorge north of Niagara Falls , which itself cascades over the escarpment . In southern Ontario , it spans the Niagara Peninsula , closely following the Lake Ontario shore through the cities of St. Catharines , Hamilton , and Dundas , where it takes a sharp turn north in the town of Milton toward Georgian Bay . It then follows the Georgian Bay shore northwestwards to form the spine of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island , as well as several smaller islands in northern Lake Huron , where it turns westwards into the Upper Peninsula of northern Michigan , south of Sault Ste . Marie .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Queenston_Heights": "The Battle of Queenston Heights was the first major battle in the War of 1812 . Resulting in a British victory , it took place on 13 October 1812 , near Queenston , Upper Canada ( the present-day province of Ontario ) . It was fought between United States regulars and New York militia forces led by Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer , and British regulars , York and Lincoln militia and Mohawk warriors led by Major General Isaac Brock , and Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe , who took command when Brock was killed . The battle was fought as the result of an American attempt to establish a foothold on the Canadian side of the Niagara River before campaigning ended with the onset of winter . This decisive battle was the culmination of a poorly managed American offensive and may be most historically significant for the loss of the British commander . Despite their numerical advantage and the wide dispersal of British forces defending against their invasion attempt , the Americans , who were stationed in Lewiston , New York , were unable to get the bulk of their invasion force across the Niagara River due to the work of British artillery and reluctance on the part of the undertrained and inexperienced American militia . As a result , British reinforcements arrived and defeated the unsupported American forces , forcing them to surrender .",

Sir Adam Beck Generating Station I , Sir Adam Beck Generating Station II and the Sir Adam Beck Pump Generating Station are all owned by Ontario Power Generation . Following the development of several smaller generating stations around Niagara Falls in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the Province of Ontario authorized the construction of first major publicly owned generating station in the province . At the time it was built , it was the largest hydroelectric generating station in the world .

  "/wiki/Hydroelectricity_in_Canada": "Canada is the world 's second largest producer of hydroelectricity after China . In 2014 , Canada consumed the equivalent of 85.7 megatonnes worth of oil of hydroelectricity , 9.8% of worldwide hydroelectric consumption . Furthermore , hydroelectricity accounted for 25.7% of Canada 's total energy consumption ( 37.3% of non-oil sources ) . It is the third-most consumed energy in Canada behind oil and natural gas ( 30.9% and 28.1% of total consumption , respectively ) . Some provinces and territories , such as British Columbia , Manitoba , Newfoundland and Labrador , Quebec and Yukon produce over 90% of their electricity from Hydro . All of the dams with large reservoirs were completed before 1990 , since then most development has been run-of-the-river , both large and small . Natural Resources Canada calculates the current installed small hydro capacity is 3,400 MW , with an estimated potential of 15,000 MW . A report on the future of hydroelectricity , suggests the remaining 78% potential will remain undeveloped up to 2050 , citing a lack of public acceptance . The widespread usage of hydroelectricity , including being incorporated into electric utility names such as Toronto Hydro or BC Hydro , has led to hydro being used in some parts of Canada to refer to electricity in general , regardless of source . Canada has about 75 GW of installed hydroelectric capacity , producing 392 TWh of electricity in 2013 ."
