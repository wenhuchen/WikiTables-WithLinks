  "/wiki/Gas_giant": "A gas giant is a giant planet composed mainly of hydrogen and helium . Gas giants are sometimes known as failed stars because they contain the same basic elements as a star . Jupiter and Saturn are the gas giants of the Solar System . The term gas giant was originally synonymous with giant planet , but in the 1990s it became known that Uranus and Neptune are really a distinct class of giant planet , being composed mainly of heavier volatile substances ( which are referred to as ices ) . For this reason , Uranus and Neptune are now often classified in the separate category of ice giants . Jupiter and Saturn consist mostly of hydrogen and helium , with heavier elements making up between 3 and 13 percent of the mass . They are thought to consist of an outer layer of molecular hydrogen surrounding a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen , with probably a molten rocky core . The outermost portion of their hydrogen atmosphere is characterized by many layers of visible clouds that are mostly composed of water and ammonia . The layer of metallic hydrogen makes up the bulk of each planet , and is referred to as metallic because the very large pressure turns hydrogen into an electrical conductor . The gas giants ' cores are thought to consist of heavier elements at such high temperatures ( 20,000 K ) and pressures that their properties are poorly understood . The defining differences between a very low-mass brown dwarf and a gas giant ( estimated at about 13 Jupiter masses ) are debated . One school of thought is based on formation ; the other , on the physics of the interior .",

  "/wiki/Fabulation": "In literary criticism , the term fabulation was popularized by Robert Scholes , in his work The Fabulators , to describe the large and growing class of mostly 20th century novels that are in a style similar to magical realism , and do not fit into the traditional categories of realism or ( novelistic ) romance . They violate , in a variety of ways , standard novelistic expectations by drastic - and sometimes highly successful - experiments with subject matter , form , style , temporal sequence , and fusions of the everyday , fantastic , mythical , and nightmarish , in renderings that blur traditional distinctions between what is serious or trivial , horrible or ludicrous , tragic or comic . To a large extent , fabulism and postmodernism coincide ; John Barth , for example , was labeled a fabulist until the term postmodernism was coined [ citation needed ] .",
  "/wiki/Metafiction": "Metafiction is a form of fiction that emphasizes its own constructedness in a way that continually reminds the reader to be aware that they are reading or viewing a fictional work . Metafiction is self-conscious about language , literary form , and storytelling , and works of metafiction directly or indirectly draw attention to their status as artifacts . Metafiction is frequently used as a form of parody or a tool to undermine literary conventions and explore the relationship between literature and reality , life , and art . Although metafiction is most commonly associated with postmodern literature that developed in the mid-20th Century , its use can be traced back to much earlier works of fiction , such as Geoffrey Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales ( 1387 ) , Miguel de Cervantes 's Don Quixote ( 1605 ) , Laurence Sterne 's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy , Gentleman ( 1759 ) , William Makepeace Thackeray 's Vanity Fair ( 1847 ) , as well as more recent works such as Douglas Adams ' The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ( 1979 ) and Mark Z. Danielewski 's House of Leaves ( 2000 ) . Metafiction , however , became particularly prominent in the 1960s , with authors and works such as John Barth 's Lost in the Funhouse , Robert Coover 's The Babysitter and The Magic Poker , Kurt Vonnegut 's Slaughterhouse-Five , John Fowles ' The French Lieutenant 's Woman , Thomas Pynchon 's The Crying of Lot 49 and William H. Gass 's Willie Master 's Lonesome Wife .",
  "/wiki/The_Public_Burning": "The Public Burning , Robert Coover 's third novel , was published in 1977 . It is an account of the events leading to the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg . An uncharacteristically human caricature of Richard Nixon serves as protagonist and narrator for the primary continuity . The novel satirizes the Cold War politics of Joseph McCarthy by portraying The Phantom as the embodiment of global Communism and everything that threatens the American way of life - a vague , terrifying , and omnipresent enemy . The ugly side of the American psyche this draws out is characterized by an incarnation of Uncle Sam who unleashes a torrent of interminable verbosity in a folksy , foul-mouthed style whenever he appears . The New York Times and Time Magazine figure centrally as symbols of institutional failure not only to question whether the truth was a victim in this hyperpoliticized trial but also whether the official narrative was in fact a bunch of political lies . Coover first experienced difficulty finding a publisher , and then when he found a publisher , getting it to actually publish the novel , due to legal concerns over the unflattering depiction of Richard Nixon , Pat Nixon , Roy Cohn , and others . Then having published the novel , once it became a bestseller , Viking immediately abandoned all support , and pulled in copies , without explanation . Coover 's editor , Richard Seaver , speculated to Coover that Viking management believed success would attract lawsuits . Despite these difficulties , this novel has received a large amount of critical attention . It has been called perhaps the most complete replenishment of the language since Whitman and ( in a different way ) Mark Twain . no writer since Melville has dived so deeply and fearlessly into this collective American dream as Coover has in this novel .",
