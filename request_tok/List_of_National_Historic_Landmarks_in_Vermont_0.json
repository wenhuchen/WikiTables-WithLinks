A Republican lawyer from New England , born in Vermont , Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics , eventually becoming governor of Massachusetts . His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action . The next year , he was elected vice president of the United States , and he succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923 . Elected in his own right in 1924 , he gained a reputation as a small government conservative and also as a man who said very little and had a rather dry sense of humor . Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor 's administration , and left office with considerable popularity . As a Coolidge biographer wrote : He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class , could interpret their longings and express their opinions . That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength . Scholars have ranked Coolidge in the lower half of those presidents that they have assessed . He is praised by advocates of smaller government and laissez-faire economics , while supporters of an active central government generally view him less favorably , although most praise his stalwart support of racial equality .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War": "The American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , also known as the American War of Independence , was fought primarily between the Kingdom of Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies in America ; it resulted in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the United States of America . [ N 1 ] After 1765 , growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies . Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts , which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor . Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony . Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves , and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown . Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress ( with the exception of Georgia ) to coordinate their resistance , establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power . British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in Concord led to open combat and a British defeat on April 19 , 1775 . Militia forces then besieged Boston , forcing a British evacuation in March 1776 , and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army . Concurrently , the Americans failed decisively in an attempt to invade Quebec and raise insurrection against the British . On July 2 , 1776 , the Second Continental Congress voted for independence , issuing its declaration on July 4 . Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive , capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb . However , victories at Trenton and Princeton restored American confidence .",

It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbini\u00e8re , Marquis de Lotbini\u00e8re between October 1755 and 1757 , during the action in the North American theater of the Seven Years ' War , often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War . The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France , and again played an important role during the Revolutionary War . The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River , in the 3.5 miles ( 5.6 km ) between Lake Champlain and Lake George . It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley . The terrain amplified the importance of the site . Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north-south , as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains , which extended as far south as Georgia . The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded . The name Ticonderoga comes from the Iroquois word tekontar\u00f3 : ken , meaning it is at the junction of two waterways . During the 1758 Battle of Carillon , 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort . In 1759 , the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort . During the Revolutionary War , when the British controlled the fort , it was attacked on May 10 , 1775 , in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold , who captured it in the surprise attack .",

He was born in India , which inspired much of his work . Kipling 's works of fiction include The Jungle Book ( 1894 ) , Kim ( 1901 ) , and many short stories , including The Man Who Would Be King ( 1888 ) . His poems include Mandalay ( 1890 ) , Gunga Din ( 1890 ) , The Gods of the Copybook Headings ( 1919 ) , The White Man 's Burden ( 1899 ) , and If - ( 1910 ) .

Kipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdom 's most popular writers . Henry James said , Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius , as distinct from fine intelligence , that I have ever known . In 1907 , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature , as the first English-language writer to receive the prize , and at 41 , its youngest recipient to date . He was also sounded for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood , but declined both .

  "/wiki/The_Jungle_Book": "The Jungle Book ( 1894 ) is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling . Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear , though a principal character is the boy or man-cub Mowgli , who is raised in the jungle by wolves . The stories are set in a forest in India ; one place mentioned repeatedly is Seonee ( Seoni ) , in the central state of Madhya Pradesh . A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering , as in the life of Mowgli , echoing Kipling 's own childhood . The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies , as well as Mowgli 's . Another important theme is of law and freedom ; the stories are not about animal behaviour , still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival , but about human archetypes in animal form . They teach respect for authority , obedience , and knowing one 's place in society with the law of the jungle , but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds , such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village . Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories , reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature . The Jungle Book has remained popular , partly through its many adaptations for film and other media . Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling . The book has been influential in the scout movement , whose founder , Robert Baden-Powell , was a friend of Kipling 's . Percy Grainger composed his Jungle Book Cycle around quotations from the book .",

These are also known as mass scales , weight scales , mass balances , weight balances , or simply scales , balances , or balance scales .

One plate holds an object of unknown mass ( or weight ) , while known masses are added to the other plate until static equilibrium is achieved and the plates level off , which happens when the masses on the two plates are equal . The perfect scale rests at neutral . A spring scale will make use of a spring of known stiffness to determine mass ( or weight ) . Suspending a certain mass will extend the spring by a certain amount depending on the spring 's stiffness ( or spring constant ) . The heavier the object , the more the spring stretches , as described in Hooke 's law . Other types of scales making use of different physical principles also exist . Some scales can be calibrated to read in units of force ( weight ) such as newtons instead of units of mass such as kilograms . Scales and balances are widely used in commerce , as many products are sold and packaged by mass .",
