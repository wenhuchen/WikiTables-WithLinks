The organisation was a state enterprise until 14 May 2018 when it was corporatized as a juristic organization under the Finance ministry and assumed its new name , Tobacco Authority of Thailand . In its early days , the TTM had a monopoly over the manufacturing and distribution of tobacco products . The ratification of the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement in 1992 meant that foreign tobacco companies could now distribute their own cigarettes in Thailand , and foreign companies could share in the Thai market . As of 14 May 2018 , the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly was corporatized as the Tobacco Authority of Thailand . According to the Tobacco Authority of Thailand Act 2018 as announced in the Royal Thai Government Gazette , the act allows TOAT to set up limited companies or public companies related to TOAT 's business . These companies are permitted to have foreign shareholders hold up to 49 percent of total company shares . TOAT can also hold shares in other companies if relevant to TOAT 's business .",
