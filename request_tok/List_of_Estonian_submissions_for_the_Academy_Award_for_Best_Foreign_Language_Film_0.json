  "/wiki/1944_(film)": "1944 is a 2015 Estonian war drama film directed by Elmo N\u00fcganen . The film first premiered in February 2015 in Berlin , Germany , before its release in Estonia and other Northern European countries . It was selected as the Estonian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards but it was not nominated . As the Soviet Union advances to recapture Estonia from its German occupiers , with huge losses on both sides , the film explores the mental conflicts of young Estonians . Some have volunteered or been conscripted into the German forces , most with little commitment to the Nazi regime . Others have volunteered or been conscripted into the Soviet forces , again with little commitment to the Communist regime . Whichever side wins will regard the Estonians on the opposing side as traitors , liable to execution or deportation . Neither side offers the Estonians autonomy from foreign control .",
