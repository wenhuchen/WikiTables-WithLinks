His first major gothic horror film was The Curse of Frankenstein ( 1957 ) , which launched Hammer 's association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era . He went on to film several adaptations of classic horror subjects , including Dracula ( 1958 ) , The Mummy ( 1959 ) , and The Curse of the Werewolf ( 1961 ) . Given their subject matter and lurid approach , Fisher 's films , though commercially successful , were largely dismissed by critics during his career . It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an auteur in his own right . His most famous films are characterised by a blend of fairytale myth and the supernatural alongside themes of sexuality , morality , and the charm of evil . Drawing heavily on a Christian conservative outlook , there is often a hero who defeats the powers of darkness by a combination of faith in God and reason , in contrast to other characters , who are either blindly superstitious or bound by cold , godless rationalism .

Like its predecessors , it is based on a BBC Television serial Quatermass and the Pit , written by Nigel Kneale . It was directed by Roy Ward Baker and stars Andrew Keir in the title role as Professor Bernard Quatermass , replacing Brian Donlevy who played the role in the two earlier films . James Donald , Barbara Shelley and Julian Glover appear in co-starring roles . The storyline , which is largely faithful to the original television production , centres on the discovery of a mysterious object buried at the site of an extension to the London Underground . Also uncovered nearby are the remains of early human ancestors more than five million years old . Realising that the object is in fact an ancient Martian spacecraft , Quatermass deduces that the aliens have influenced human evolution and the development of human intelligence . The spacecraft has an intelligence of its own , and once uncovered begins to exert a malign influence , resurrecting Martian memories and instincts buried deep within the human psyche . Nigel Kneale wrote the first draft of the screenplay in 1961 , but difficulties in attracting interest from American co-financiers meant the film did not go into production until 1967 . The director , Roy Ward Baker , was chosen because of his experience with technically demanding productions such as A Night to Remember ; this was the first of six films that he directed for Hammer . Andrew Keir , playing Quatermass , found making the film an unhappy experience , believing Baker had wanted Kenneth More to play the role .
