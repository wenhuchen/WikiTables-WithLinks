Ernest Hemingway never met Baker , according to Hemingway 's fourth wife , Mary Welsh Hemingway , who also asserts in her 1976 book How It Was that Hemingway deliberately chose someone who never knew him . Mary does not offer a specific reason for this choice , but Baker had published Hemingway : The Writer as Artist in 1952 , which favorably treated Hemingway 's work to that date . Baker 's other major works include biographies of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Ralph Waldo Emerson . Baker taught biographer A. Scott Berg while Berg was an undergraduate at Princeton in the late 1960s . Berg recalled that Baker changed my life , and convinced him to quit acting to concentrate on his thesis , a study of editor Maxwell Perkins .

Established by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in 1863 , it initially grew in Persia and parts of the Middle East , where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception . It is estimated to have between 5 and 8 million adherents , known as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds , spread throughout most of the world 's countries and territories . It grew from the mid-19th-century B\u00e1b\u00ed religion , whose founder ( the B\u00e1b ) taught that God would soon send a prophet in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad . In 1863 , after being banished from his native Iran , Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h ( 1817-1892 ) announced that he was this prophet .

Established in 1824 , it has been the top-ranked law school in the United States by U.S. News and World Report every year since the magazine began publishing law school rankings in the 1980s .

Yale Law has produced a significant number of luminaries in law and politics , including United States presidents Gerald Ford , Bill Clinton and former U.S. secretary of state and presidential nominee , Hillary Clinton .
