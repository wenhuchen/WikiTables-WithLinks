A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era , Altman was considered a maverick in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic , unlike most Hollywood films . He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema . His style of filmmaking covered many genres , but usually with a subversive twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views . Altman developed a reputation for being anti-Hollywood and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style . However , actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise , thereby inspiring their own creativity . He preferred large ensemble casts for his films , and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors . This produced a more natural , more dynamic , and more complex experience for the viewer . He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen . Critic Pauline Kael , writing about his directing style , said that Altman could make film fireworks out of next to nothing . In 2006 , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman 's body of work with an Academy Honorary Award . He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations .",
