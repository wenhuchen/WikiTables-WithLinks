New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark .

In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

  "/wiki/The_Tempest": "The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare , probably written in 1610-1611 , and thought to be one of the last plays that Shakespeare wrote alone . After the first scene , which takes place on a ship at sea during a tempest , the rest of the story is set on a remote island , where the sorcerer Prospero , a complex and contradictory character , lives with his daughter Miranda , and his two servants - Caliban , a savage monster figure , and Ariel , an airy spirit . The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island . It explores many themes , including magic , betrayal , revenge , and family . In Act IV , a wedding masque serves as a play-within-the play , and contributes spectacle , allegory , and elevated language . Though The Tempest is listed in the First Folio as the first of Shakespeare 's comedies , it deals with both tragic and comic themes , and modern criticism has created a category of romance for this and others of Shakespeare 's late plays . The Tempest has been put to varied interpretations - from those that see it as a fable of art and creation , with Prospero representing Shakespeare , and Prospero 's renunciation of magic signaling Shakespeare 's farewell to the stage , to interpretations that consider it an allegory of Europeans colonizing foreign lands .",
