Ion Television is available throughout most of the United States through its group of 62 owned-and-operated stations , as well as through distribution on cable and satellite providers ; since 2014 , the network has also increased affiliate distribution in several markets through the digital subchannels of local television stations owned by companies such as NBCUniversal and Nexstar Media Group where the network is unable to maintain a main channel affiliation with or own a standalone station , for the same purpose as the distribution of Ion 's main network feed via cable and satellite . The network 's stations cover all of the top 20 U.S. markets and 37 of the top 50 markets . Ion 's owned-and-operated stations cover 64.8% of the United States population , by far the most of any U.S. station ownership group ; it is able to circumvent the legal limit of covering 39% of the population because all of its stations operate on the UHF television band , which is subject to a discount ( which in the digital age has proven controversial with other broadcast groups and FCC rulings between presidential administrations , though not with Ion itself ) in regard to that limit .",

Independent radio is a similar concept with regards to community radio stations , although with a slightly different meaning ( as many non-indie commercial broadcasting radio stations produce the vast majority of their own programming , perhaps retaining only a nominal affiliation with a radio network for news updates or syndicated radio programming ) .",
