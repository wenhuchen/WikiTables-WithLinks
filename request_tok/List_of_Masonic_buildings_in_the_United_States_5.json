  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
