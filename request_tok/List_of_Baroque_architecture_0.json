  "/wiki/St_Peter's_Basilica": "The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican ( Italian : Basilica Papale di San Pietro in Vaticano ) , or simply Saint Peter 's Basilica ( Latin : Basilica Sancti Petri ) , is a church built in the Renaissance style located in Vatican City , the papal enclave which is within the city of Rome . Designed principally by Donato Bramante , Michelangelo , Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini , St. Peter 's is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world . While it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome ( these equivalent titles being held by the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome ) , St. Peter 's is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines . It has been described as holding a unique position in the Christian world and as the greatest of all churches of Christendom . Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of Saint Peter , chief among Jesus 's apostles and also the first Bishop of Rome ( Pope ) . Saint Peter 's tomb is supposedly directly below the high altar of the basilica . For this reason , many popes have been interred at St. Peter 's since the Early Christian period . A church has stood on this site since the time of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great . Old St. Peter 's Basilica dates from the 4th century AD . Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626 . St. Peter 's is famous as a place of pilgrimage and for its liturgical functions . The pope presides at a number of liturgies throughout the year both within the basilica or the adjoining St. Peter 's Square ; these liturgies draw audiences numbering from 15,000 to over 80,000 people .",

Established with the Lateran Treaty ( 1929 ) , it is distinct from , yet under full ownership , exclusive dominion , and sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the Holy See ( Latin : Sancta Sedes ) . [ g ] With an area of 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of about 1,000 , it is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area and population . The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere . The Holy See dates back to early Christianity , and is the primate episcopal see of the Catholic Church , with 1.3 billion Catholic Christians around the world distributed in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches . The independent Vatican City-state , on the other hand , came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756-1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy . Within the Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter 's Basilica , the Sistine Chapel , and the Vatican Museums . They feature some of the world 's most famous paintings and sculptures . The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs , fees for admission to museums , and sales of publications .",

Considered by many the greatest artist of his lifetime , and by some the greatest artist of all time , his artistic versatility was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man , along with his rival , the fellow Florentine and client of the Medici , Leonardo da Vinci . A number of Michelangelo 's works of painting , sculpture and architecture rank among the most famous in existence . His output in these fields was prodigious ; given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence , sketches and reminiscences , he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century . He sculpted two of his best-known works , the Piet\u00e0 and David , before the age of thirty . Despite holding a low opinion of painting , he also created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art : the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome , and The Last Judgment on its altar wall . His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture . At the age of 74 , he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter 's Basilica . He transformed the plan so that the western end was finished to his design , as was the dome , with some modification , after his death . Michelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive . In fact , two biographies were published during his lifetime . One of them , by Giorgio Vasari , proposed that Michelangelo 's work transcended that of any artist living or dead , and was supreme in not one art alone but in all three .",

A keen student of the architecture of Michelangelo and the ruins of Antiquity , Borromini developed an inventive and distinctive , if somewhat idiosyncratic , architecture employing manipulations of Classical architectural forms , geometrical rationales in his plans and symbolic meanings in his buildings . He seems to have had a sound understanding of structures , which perhaps Bernini and Cortona , who were principally trained in other areas of the visual arts , lacked . His soft lead drawings are particularly distinctive . He appears to have been a self-taught scholar , amassing a large library by the end of his life . His career was constrained by his personality . Unlike Bernini who easily adopted the mantle of the charming courtier in his pursuit of important commissions , Borromini was both melancholic and quick in temper which resulted in him withdrawing from certain jobs , and his death was by suicide . Probably because his work was idiosyncratic , his subsequent influence was not widespread but is apparent in the Piedmontese works of Camillo-Guarino Guarini and , as a fusion with the architectural modes of Bernini and Cortona , in the late Baroque architecture of Northern Europe . Later critics of the Baroque , such as Francesco Milizia and the English architect Sir John Soane , were particularly critical of Borromini 's work .

The palace , one of England 's largest houses , was built between 1705 and 1722 , and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 . The palace is named for the 1704 Battle of Blenheim , and thus ultimately after Blindheim ( also known as Blenheim ) in Bavaria . It was originally intended to be a reward to John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough for his military triumphs against the French and Bavarians in the War of the Spanish Succession , culminating in the Battle of Blenheim . The land was given as a gift , and construction began in 1705 , with some financial support from Queen Anne . The project soon became the subject of political infighting , with the Crown cancelling further financial support in 1712 , Marlborough 's three-year voluntary exile to the Continent , the fall from influence of his duchy and lasting damage to the reputation of the architect Sir John Vanbrugh . Designed in the rare , and short-lived , English Baroque style , architectural appreciation of the palace is as divided today as it was in the 1720s . It is unique in its combined use as a family home , mausoleum and national monument . The palace is notable as the birthplace and ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill .

In his career as a playwright , he offended many sections of Restoration and 18th century society , not only by the sexual explicitness of his plays , but also by their messages in defence of women 's rights in marriage . He was attacked on both counts , and was one of the prime targets of Jeremy Collier 's Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage .
