  "/wiki/Contact_lense": "A contact lens , or simply contact , is a thin lens placed directly on the surface of the eye . Contact lenses are ocular prosthetic devices used by over 150 million people worldwide , and they can be worn to correct vision , for cosmetic , or therapeutic reasons . In 2010 , the worldwide market for contact lenses was estimated at $ 6.1 billion , while the US soft lens market was estimated at $ 2.1 billion . Multiple analysts estimated that the global market for contact lenses would reach $ 11.7 billion by 2015 . As of 2010 [ update ] , the average age of contact lens wearers globally was 31 years old , and two-thirds of wearers were female . People choose to wear contact lenses for many reasons . Aesthetics and cosmetics are the main motivating factors for people who want to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes . Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons . When compared with spectacles , contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision , and do not collect moisture ( from rain , snow , condensation etc . ) or perspiration . This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities . Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses , goggles , or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses .",
  "/wiki/Tap_water": "Tap water ( running water , city water , town water , municipal water , sink water , etc . ) is water supplied to a tap ( valve ) . Its uses include drinking , washing , cooking , and the flushing of toilets . Indoor tap water is distributed through indoor plumbing , which has existed since antiquity but was available to very few people until the second half of the 19th century when it began to spread in popularity in what are now developed countries . Tap water became common in many regions during the 20th century , and is now lacking mainly among people in poverty , especially in developing countries . Tap water is often culturally assumed to be drinking water , especially in developed countries . Usually it is potable , although water quality problems are not rare . Household water purification methods such as water filters , boiling , or distillation can be used when tap water 's potability is doubted . The application of technologies ( such as water treatment plants ) involved in providing clean water to homes , businesses , and public buildings is a major subfield of sanitary engineering . Calling a water supply tap water distinguishes it from the other main types of fresh water which may be available ; these include water from rainwater-collecting cisterns , water from village pumps or town pumps , water from wells , or water carried from streams , rivers , or lakes ( whose potability may vary ) .",

B. mandrillaris is found in the soil and water and was first discovered in 1986 in the brain of a mandrill that died in the San Diego Wild Animal Park . B. mandrillaris can infect the body through open wounds or by inhalation . Balamuthia has been isolated in nature . It is believed to be distributed throughout the temperate regions of the world . This is supported somewhat by the detection of antibodies to the protist in healthy individuals . The genus name Balamuthia was given by Govinda Visvesvara ( b. September 28 , 1931 ) , in honor of his late mentor , the renowned parasitologist William Balamuth ( 1914-1981 ) for his contributions to the study of amoebae .

Human babesiosis transmission via tick bite is most common in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and parts of Europe , and sporadic throughout the rest of the world . It occurs in warm weather . People can get infected with Babesia parasites by the bite of an infected tick , by getting a blood transfusion from an infected donor of blood products , or by congenital transmission ( an infected mother to her baby ) . Ticks transmit the human strain of babesiosis , so it often presents with other tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease .

It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and by the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick to the northeast and Quebec to the north . The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast , and Long Island Sound is to the southwest . Boston is New England 's largest city , as well as the capital of Massachusetts . Greater Boston is the largest metropolitan area , with nearly a third of New England 's population ; this area includes Worcester , Massachusetts ( the second-largest city in New England ) , Manchester , New Hampshire ( the largest city in New Hampshire ) , and Providence , Rhode Island ( the capital and largest city of Rhode Island ) . In 1620 , Puritan Separatist Pilgrims from England established Plymouth Colony , the second successful English settlement in America , following the Jamestown Settlement in Virginia founded in 1607 . Ten years later , more Puritans established Massachusetts Bay Colony north of Plymouth Colony . Over the next 126 years , people in the region fought in four French and Indian Wars , until the English colonists and their Iroquois allies defeated the French and their Algonquian allies in America . In 1692 , the town of Salem , Massachusetts and surrounding areas experienced the Salem witch trials , one of the most infamous cases of mass hysteria in history . In the late 18th century , political leaders from the New England colonies initiated resistance to Britain 's taxes without the consent of the colonists . Residents of Rhode Island captured and burned a British ship which was enforcing unpopular trade restrictions , and residents of Boston threw British tea into the harbor . Britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping Massachusetts of self-government which the colonists called the Intolerable Acts .",

Blastocystis consists of several species , living in the gastrointestinal tracts of species as diverse as humans , farm animals , birds , rodents , reptiles , amphibians , fish , and cockroaches . Blastocystis exhibits low host specificity , and many different species of Blastocystis can infect humans , and by current convention , any of these species would be identified as Blastocystis hominis . Blastocystis is one of the most common human parasites in the world and has a global distribution . It is the most common parasitic infection in the United States , where it infected approximately 23% of the total population during year 2000 . In less developed areas , infection rates as high as 100% have been observed . High rates of infection are found in individuals in developed countries who work with animals . Although the role of Blastocystis hominis in human disease is often referred to as controversial , a systematic survey of research studies conducted by 11 infectious disease specialists from nine countries , found that over 95% of papers published in the 10 years prior identified it as causing illness in immunocompetent individuals . The paper attributed confusion over pathogenicity to the existence of asymptomatic carriers , a phenomenon the study noted is common to all gastrointestinal protozoa . However , Blastocystis has never fulfilled Koch 's postulate that infection of a healthy individual with Blastocystis leads to disease . The fact that Blastocystis ' infection route is oral-anal indicates that carriers have been in contact with faecal contaminated matter which might have included other intestinal pathogens that explain the observed symptoms .

  "/wiki/Malaria": "Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals . Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever , tiredness , vomiting , and headaches . In severe cases it can cause yellow skin , seizures , coma , or death . Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito . If not properly treated , people may have recurrences of the disease months later . In those who have recently survived an infection , reinfection usually causes milder symptoms . This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria . It is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group . The disease is most commonly spread by an infected female Anopheles mosquito . The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito 's saliva into a person 's blood . The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce . Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans .",
  "/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum": "Plasmodium falciparum is a unicellular protozoan parasite of humans , and the deadliest species of Plasmodium that causes malaria in humans . The parasite is transmitted through the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito and causes the disease 's most dangerous form called falciparum malaria which is responsible for around 50% of all malaria cases . P. falciparum is therefore regarded as the deadliest parasite in humans , causing 405,000 deaths in 2018 . It is also associated with the development of blood cancer ( Burkitt 's lymphoma ) and is classified as Group 2A carcinogen . The species originated from the malarial parasite Laverania found in gorillas , around 10,000 years ago . Alphonse Laveran was the first to identify the parasite in 1880 , and named it Oscillaria malariae . Ronald Ross discovered its transmission by mosquito in 1897 . Giovanni Battista Grassi elucidated the complete transmission from a female anopheline mosquito to humans in 1898 . In 1897 , William H. Welch created the name Plasmodium falciparum , which ICZN formally adopted in 1954 . P. falciparum assumes several different forms during its life cycle .

It is found throughout Southeast Asia , and is the most common cause of human malaria in Malaysia . Like other Plasmodium species , P. knowlesi has a life cycle that requires infection of both a mosquito and a warm-blooded host . While the natural warm-blooded hosts of P. knowlesi are likely various Old World monkeys , humans can be infected by P. knowlesi if they are fed upon by infected mosquitoes . P. knowlesi is a eukaryote in the phylum Apicomplexa , genus Plasmodium , and subgenus Plasmodium . It is most closely related to the human parasite Plasmodium vivax as well as other Plasmodium species that infect non-human primates . Humans infected with P. knowlesi can develop uncomplicated or severe malaria similar to that caused by Plasmodium falciparum . Diagnosis of P. knowlesi infection is challenging as P. knowlesi very closely resembles other species that infect humans . Treatment is similar to other types of malaria , with chloroquine or artemisinin combination therapy typically recommended . P. knowlesi malaria is an emerging disease previously thought to be rare in humans , but increasingly recognized as a major health burden in Southeast Asia .

The parasite reproduces sexually in the gut of the definitive host , is passed with the feces , and ingested by the intermediate host . There , it eventually enters muscle tissue . When the intermediate host is eaten by the definitive host , the cycle is completed . The definitive host usually does not show any symptoms of infection , but the intermediate host does . About 130 recognized species are in this genus .

  "/wiki/Intestine": "The gastrointestinal tract ( digestive tract , alimentary canal , digestion tract , GI tract , GIT ) is an organ system within humans and other animals which takes in food , digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients , and expels the remaining waste as feces . The mouth , esophagus , stomach and intestines are part of the gastrointestinal tract . Gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the stomach and intestines . A tract is a collection of related anatomic structures or a series of connected body organs . All bilaterians have a gastrointestinal tract , also called a gut or an alimentary canal . This is a tube that transfers food to the organs of digestion . In large bilaterians , the gastrointestinal tract also has an exit , the anus , by which the animal disposes of feces ( solid wastes ) . Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means ( for example , through the mouth ) . The human gastrointestinal tract consists of the esophagus , stomach , and intestines , and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts . The GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus , forming a continuous passageway that includes the main organs of digestion , namely , the stomach , small intestine , and large intestine .

  "/wiki/Muscle": "Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals . Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another , producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell . Muscles function to produce force and motion . They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture , locomotion , as well as movement of internal organs , such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis . Muscle tissues are derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells in a process known as myogenesis . There are three types of muscle , skeletal or striated , cardiac , and smooth . Muscle action can be classified as being either voluntary or involuntary . Cardiac and smooth muscles contract without conscious thought and are termed involuntary , whereas the skeletal muscles contract upon command . Skeletal muscles in turn can be divided into fast and slow twitch fibers . Muscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates , but anaerobic chemical reactions are also used , particularly by fast twitch fibers . These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) molecules that are used to power the movement of the myosin heads . The term muscle is derived from the Latin musculus meaning little mouse perhaps because of the shape of certain muscles or because contracting muscles look like mice moving under the skin .",

Found worldwide , T. gondii is capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals , :1 but felids , such as domestic cats , are the only known definitive hosts in which the parasite may undergo sexual reproduction . In humans , T. gondii is one of the most common parasites in developed countries ; serological studies estimate that 30-50% of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically infected with T. gondii , although infection rates differ significantly from country to country . For example , previous estimates have shown the highest prevalence of persons infected to be in France , at 84% . Although mild , flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks following exposure , infection with T. gondii produces no readily observable symptoms in healthy human adults . :77 This asymptomatic state of infection is referred to as a latent infection and has recently been associated with numerous subtle adverse or pathological behavioral alterations in humans , though it has been shown recently that the association between behavioural changes and infection with T. gondii is weak . In infants , HIV/AIDS patients , and others with weakened immunity , infection may cause a serious and occasionally fatal illness , toxoplasmosis . :77 T. gondii has been shown to alter the behavior of infected rodents in ways that increase the rodents ' chances of being preyed upon by felids . Support for this manipulation hypothesis stems from studies showing T. gondii-infected rats have a decreased aversion to cat urine . Because cats are the only hosts within which T. gondii can sexually reproduce to complete and begin its lifecycle , such behavioral manipulations are thought to be evolutionary adaptations that increase the parasite 's reproductive success . The rats would not shy away from areas where cats live and would also be less able to escape should a cat try to prey on them . The primary mechanisms of T. gondii-induced behavioral changes in rodents is now known to occur through epigenetic remodeling in neurons which govern the associated behaviors ; for example , it modifies epigenetic methylation to cause hypomethylation of arginine vasopressin-related genes in the medial amygdala to greatly decrease predator aversion .",
  "/wiki/PCR": "Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is a method widely used in molecular biology to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail . PCR was invented in 1983 by Kary Mullis . It is fundamental to much of genetic testing including analysis of ancient samples of DNA and identification of infectious agents . Using PCR , copies of very small amounts of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified in a series or cycles of temperature changes . PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical laboratory and clinical laboratory research for a broad variety of applications including biomedical research and criminal forensics . The vast majority of PCR methods rely on thermal cycling . Thermal cycling exposes reactants to repeated cycles of heating and cooling to permit different temperature-dependent reactions - specifically , DNA melting and enzyme-driven DNA replication . PCR employs two main reagents - primers ( which are short single strand DNA fragments known as oligonucleotides that are a complementary sequence to the target DNA region ) and a DNA polymerase . In the first step of PCR , the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called Nucleic acid denaturation . In the second step , the temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of DNA . The two DNA strands then become templates for DNA polymerase to enzymatically assemble a new DNA strand from free nucleotides , the building blocks of DNA . As PCR progresses , the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication , setting in motion a chain reaction in which the original DNA template is exponentially amplified .",

Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine ( descriptions assassin bug , cone-nose bug , and kissing bug ) is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection . The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter , where it bites and sucks blood for food . Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host 's skin surface and then bites . Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host .",
  "/wiki/Mexico": "Mexico ( Spanish : M\u00e9xico [ \u02c8mexiko ] ( listen ) ; Nahuatl languages : M\u0113xihco ) , officially the United Mexican States ( UMS ; Spanish : Estados Unidos Mexicanos , EUM [ es\u02c8ta\u00f0os u\u02c8ni\u00f0oz mexi\u02c8kanos ] ( listen ) , lit . Mexican United States ) , is a country in the southern portion of North America . It is bordered to the north by the United States ; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean ; to the southeast by Guatemala , Belize , and the Caribbean Sea ; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico . Covering almost 2,000,000 square kilometers ( 770,000 sq mi ) , the nation is the fifth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent state in the world . With an estimated population of over 129 million people , Mexico is the tenth most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world , while being the second most populous nation in Latin America after Brazil . Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states plus Mexico City ( CDMX ) , which is the capital city and its most populous city . Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara , Monterrey , Puebla , Toluca , Tijuana , and Le\u00f3n . Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec , Toltec , Teotihuacan , Zapotec , Maya , and Aztec before first contact with Europeans . In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",
  "/wiki/Triatoma": "Triatoma is a genus of assassin bug in the subfamily Triatominae ( kissing bugs ) . The members of Triatoma ( like all members of Triatominae ) are blood-sucking insects that can transmit serious diseases , such as Chagas disease . Their saliva may also trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals , up to and including severe anaphylactic shock .",
  "/wiki/Reduviidae": "The Reduviidae are a large cosmopolitan family of the order Hemiptera ( true bugs ) . They are unusual among the Hemiptera because almost all are terrestrial ambush predators ( most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic ) . The main examples of nonpredatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae . Though spectacular exceptions are known , most members of the family are fairly easily recognizable ; they have a relatively narrow neck , sturdy build , and formidable curved proboscis ( sometimes called a rostrum ) . Large specimens should be handled with caution , if at all , because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis ."
