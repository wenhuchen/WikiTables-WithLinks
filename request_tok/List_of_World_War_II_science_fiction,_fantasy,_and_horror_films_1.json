  "/wiki/J.M._Barrie": "Sir James Matthew Barrie , 1st Baronet , OM ( /\u02c8b\u00e6ri/ ; 9 May 1860 - 19 June 1937 ) was a Scottish novelist and playwright , best remembered as the creator of Peter Pan . He was born and educated in Scotland and then moved to London , where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays . There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys , who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens ( first included in Barrie 's adult novel The Little White Bird ) , then to write Peter Pan , or The Boy Who Would n't Grow Up , a fairy play about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland . Although he continued to write successfully , Peter Pan overshadowed his other work , and is credited with popularising the name Wendy . Barrie unofficially adopted the Davies boys following the deaths of their parents . Barrie was made a baronet by George V on 14 June 1913 , and a member of the Order of Merit in the 1922 New Year Honours . Before his death , he gave the rights to the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London , which continues to benefit from them .",

  "/wiki/Never_Land": "Neverland is a fictional island featured in the works of J. M. Barrie and those based on them . It is an imaginary faraway place , where Peter Pan , Tinker Bell , the Lost Boys and other mythical creatures and beings live . Although not all people who come to Neverland cease to age , its best known resident famously refused to grow up . The term is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood ( and childishness ) , immortality , and escapism . The concept was first introduced as the Never Never Land in the theatre play Peter Pan , or The Boy Who Would n't Grow Up by Scottish writer J. M. Barrie , first staged in 1904 . In his 1911 novelisation Peter and Wendy , Barrie referred to the Neverland , and its many variations the Neverlands , although the caption to one of F. D. Bedford 's illustrations calls it The Never Never Land . In the earliest drafts of Barrie 's play , the island was called Peter 's Never Never Never Land , a name possibly influenced by the Never Never , a contemporary term for outback Australia . In the 1928 published version of the script , the name was shortened to the Never Land . Neverland has been featured prominently in subsequent works that either adapted Barrie 's works or expanded upon them . These Neverlands sometimes vary in nature from the original .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Britain": "The Battle of Britain ( German : die Luftschlacht um England , the Air Battle for England ) was a military campaign of the Second World War , in which the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) defended the United Kingdom ( UK ) against large-scale attacks by Nazi Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe . It has been described as the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces . The British officially recognise the battle 's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940 , which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz , that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941 . German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard the battle as a single campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941 , including the Blitz . The primary objective of the German forces was to compel Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement . In July 1940 , the air and sea blockade began , with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal-shipping convoys , ports and shipping centres , such as Portsmouth . On 1 August , the Luftwaffe was directed to achieve air superiority over the RAF with the aim of incapacitating RAF Fighter Command ; 12 days later , it shifted the attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure . As the battle progressed , the Luftwaffe also targeted factories involved in aircraft production and strategic infrastructure . Eventually , it employed terror bombing on areas of political significance and on civilians . [ nb 9 ] The Germans had rapidly overwhelmed France and the Low Countries , leaving Britain to face the threat of invasion by sea . The German high command knew the difficulties of a seaborne attack and its impracticality while the Royal Navy controlled the English Channel and the North Sea .

At the start of the war on 1 September 1939 , the Allies consisted of France , Poland and the United Kingdom , as well as their dependent states , such as British India . Within days they were joined by the independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth : Australia , Canada , New Zealand and South Africa . After the start of the German invasion of North Europe until the Balkan Campaign , the Netherlands , Belgium , Greece , and Yugoslavia joined the Allies . After first having cooperated with Germany in invading Poland whilst remaining neutral in the Allied-Axis conflict , the Soviet Union perforce joined the Allies in June 1941 after being invaded by Germany .

The alliance was formalised by the Declaration by United Nations , from 1 January 1942 . However , the name United Nations was rarely used to describe the Allies during the war . The leaders of the Big Three - the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom , and the United States - controlled Allied strategy ; relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were especially close .

  "/wiki/Atomic_bomb": "A nuclear weapon ( also called an atom bomb , nuke , atomic bomb , nuclear warhead , A-bomb , or nuclear bomb ) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions , either fission ( fission bomb ) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions ( thermonuclear bomb ) . Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter . The first test of a fission ( atomic ) bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT ( 84 TJ ) . The first thermonuclear ( hydrogen ) bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT ( 42 PJ ) . A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of TNT ( 5.0 PJ ) . A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast , fire , and radiation . Since they are weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy . Nuclear weapons have been used twice in war , both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed Little Boy over the Japanese city of Hiroshima ; three days later , on August 9 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed Fat Man over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel . The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan 's surrender are subjects of debate . Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration .",

  "/wiki/Wunderwaffe": "Wunderwaffe ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8v\u028and\u0250\u02ccvaf\u0259 ] ) is German for Miracle Weapon and was a term assigned during World War II by the Nazi Germany propaganda ministry to some revolutionary superweapons . Most of these weapons however remained prototypes , which either never reached the combat theater , or if they did , were too late or in too insignificant numbers to have a military effect . The V-weapons , which were developed earlier and saw considerable deployment , especially against London and Antwerp , trace back to the same pool of highly inventive armament concepts . Therefore , they are also included here . As the war situation worsened for Germany from 1942 , claims about the development of revolutionary new weapons which could turn the tide became an increasingly prominent part of the propaganda directed at Germans by their government . In reality , the advanced weapons under development generally required lengthy periods of design work and testing , and there was no realistic prospect of the German military being able to field them before the end of the war . When some advanced designs , such as the Panther tank and Type XXI submarine , were rushed into production their performance proved disappointing to the German military and leadership due to inadequate pre-production testing or poorly planned construction processes . However , a few of these weapons proved to be successful and have had a large influence in post war designs , such as the StG 44 assault rifle and the V-2 rocket . In the German language the term Wunderwaffe generally refers to a universal solution which solves all problems related to a particular issue , mostly used ironically for its illusionary nature .",

  "/wiki/Pan's_Labyrinth": "Pan 's Labyrinth ( Spanish : El laberinto del fauno , lit . 'The Labyrinth of the Faun ' ) is a 2006 Mexican-Spanish dark fantasy drama film written and directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Ivana Baquero , Sergi L\u00f3pez , Maribel Verd\u00fa , Doug Jones , and Ariadna Gil . The story takes place in Spain during the summer of 1944 , five years after the Spanish Civil War , during the early Francoist period . The narrative intertwines this real world with a mythical world centered on an overgrown , abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature , with whom the main character , Ofelia , interacts . Ofelia 's stepfather , the Falangist Captain Vidal , hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Francoist regime in the region , while Ofelia 's pregnant mother Carmen grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story , leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden . The film employs make-up , animatronics , and CGI effects to bring life to its creatures . Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable , influenced by fairy tales , and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film The Devil 's Backbone ( 2001 ) , to which Pan 's Labyrinth is a spiritual successor , according to del Toro in his director 's DVD commentary . The original Spanish title refers to the fauns of Roman mythology , while the English , German and French titles refer specifically to the faun-like Greek deity Pan .

  "/wiki/Francoist_Spain": "Francoist Spain ( Spanish : Espa\u00f1a franquista ) , known in Spain as the Francoist dictatorship ( Spanish : dictadura franquista ) , officially known as the Spanish State ( Spanish : Estado Espa\u00f1ol ) , is the period of Spanish history between 1936 and 1975 , when Francisco Franco ruled Spain as dictator with the title Caudillo . The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence . Months after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 , Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed Head of State on 1 October 1936 , ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction . The 1937 Unification Decree , which merged all parties supporting the rebel side , led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS . The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions . The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as fascistized dictatorship , or semi-fascist regime , showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations , the autarkic economic policy , aesthetics , or the single-party system . As time went on , the regime opened up and became closer to developmental dictatorships , although it always preserved residual fascist trappings . During the Second World War , Spain did not join the Axis powers ( its supporters from the civil war , Italy and Germany ) . Nevertheless , Spain would support them in various ways throughout most of the war while maintaining its neutrality . Because of this , Spain was isolated by many other countries for nearly a decade after World War II all the while its autarkic economy , still trying to recover from the civil war , suffered from chronic depression . The 1947 Law of Succession made Spain a de jure Kingdom again , but defined Franco as the Head of State for life with the power to choose the person to become King of Spain and his successor . Reforms were implemented in the 1950s and Spain abandoned autarky , delegating authority from the Falangist movement , which had been prone to isolationism , to a new breed of economists , the technocrats of Opus Dei .",

They existed during most of the Mesozoic : from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous ( 228 to 66 million years ago ) . Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight . Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin , muscle , and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger . There were two major types of pterosaurs . Basal pterosaurs ( also called 'non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs ' or rhamphorhynchoids ) were smaller animals with fully toothed jaws and , typically , long tails . Their wide wing membranes probably included and connected the hind legs . On the ground , they would have had an awkward sprawling posture , but their joint anatomy and strong claws would have made them effective climbers , and they may have lived in trees . Basal pterosaurs were insectivores or predators on small vertebrates . Later pterosaurs ( pterodactyloids ) evolved many sizes , shapes , and lifestyles . Pterodactlyoids had narrower wings with free hind limbs , highly reduced tails , and long necks with large heads . On the ground , pterodactyloids walked well on all four limbs with an upright posture , standing plantigrade on the hind feet and folding the wing finger upward to walk on the three-fingered hand .",

The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies . It combines graphic art , characterization , cinematography , and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques .",
  "/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)": "The Eastern Front of World War II was a theatre of conflict between the European Axis powers and co-belligerent Finland against the Soviet Union ( USSR ) , Poland and other Allies , which encompassed Central Europe , Eastern Europe , Northeast Europe ( Baltics ) , and Southeast Europe ( Balkans ) from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945 .

The battles on the Eastern Front of the Second World War constituted the largest military confrontation in history . They were characterised by unprecedented ferocity , wholesale destruction , mass deportations , and immense loss of life due to combat , starvation , exposure , disease , and massacres . The Eastern Front , as the site of nearly all extermination camps , death marches , ghettos , and the majority of pogroms , was central to the Holocaust . Of the estimated 70-85 million deaths attributed to World War II , around 30 million occurred on the Eastern Front . The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II , eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations . The two principal belligerent powers were Germany and the Soviet Union , along with their respective allies . Though never engaged in military action in the Eastern Front , the United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid in the form of the Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union . The joint German-Finnish operations across the northernmost Finnish-Soviet border and in the Murmansk region are considered part of the Eastern Front . In addition , the Soviet-Finnish Continuation War may also be considered the northern flank of the Eastern Front .",

West Virginia is the 41st largest state by area , and is ranked 38th in population . The capital and largest city is Charleston . West Virginia became a state following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861 , at the start of the American Civil War . Delegates from the Unionist counties of northwestern Virginia decided to break away from Virginia , which also included secessionist counties in the new state . West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20 , 1863 , and was a key border state during the war . It was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state , the first to separate from any state since Maine separated from Massachusetts , and was one of two states admitted to the Union during the American Civil War ( the other being Nevada ) . While a portion of its residents held slaves , most of the residents were yeoman farmers , and the delegates provided for gradual abolition of slavery in the new state Constitution . The Census Bureau and the Association of American Geographers classify West Virginia as part of the Southern United States . However , the Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies the state as a part of the Mid-Atlantic region . The northern panhandle extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio , with the West Virginia cities of Wheeling and Weirton just across the border from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area , while Bluefield is less than 70 miles ( 110 km ) from North Carolina ."
