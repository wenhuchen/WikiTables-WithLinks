The Second Sino-Japanese War between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China had been in progress since 7 July 1937 , with hostilities dating back as far as 19 September 1931 with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria .

The Pacific War saw the Allies pitted against Japan , the latter aided by Thailand and to a lesser extent by the Axis allies , Germany and Italy .

The battle is historically significant as the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other , as well as the first in which the opposing ships neither sighted nor fired directly upon one another . In an attempt to strengthen their defensive position in the South Pacific , the Japanese decided to invade and occupy Port Moresby ( in New Guinea ) and Tulagi ( in the southeastern Solomon Islands ) . The plan to accomplish this was called Operation Mo , and involved several major units of Japan 's Combined Fleet . These included two fleet carriers and a light carrier to provide air cover for the invasion forces . It was under the overall command of Japanese Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue . The U.S. learned of the Japanese plan through signals intelligence , and sent two United States Navy carrier task forces and a joint Australian-U.S. cruiser force to oppose the offensive . These were under the overall command of U.S. Admiral Frank J. Fletcher . On 3-4 May , Japanese forces successfully invaded and occupied Tulagi , although several of their supporting warships were sunk or damaged in surprise attacks by aircraft from the U.S. fleet carrier Yorktown . Now aware of the presence of U.S. carriers in the area , the Japanese fleet carriers advanced towards the Coral Sea with the intention of locating and destroying the Allied naval forces . On the evening of 6 May , the direction chosen for air searches by the opposing commanders brought the two carrier forces to within 70 nmi ( 81 mi ; 130 km ) of each other , unbeknownst to both sides .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Midway": "The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II that took place on 4-7 June 1942 , six months after Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea . The United States Navy under Admirals Chester W. Nimitz , Frank J. Fletcher , and Raymond A. Spruance defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto , Ch\u016bichi Nagumo , and Nobutake Kond\u014d near Midway Atoll , inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable . Military historian John Keegan called it the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare , while naval historian Craig Symonds called it one of the most consequential naval engagements in world history , ranking alongside Salamis , Trafalgar , and Tsushima Strait , as both tactically decisive and strategically influential . The Japanese operation , like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor , sought to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific , thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . The Japanese hoped another demoralizing defeat would force the U.S. to capitulate in the Pacific War and thus ensure Japanese dominance in the Pacific . Luring the American aircraft carriers into a trap and occupying Midway was part of an overall barrier strategy to extend Japan 's defensive perimeter , in response to the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo . This operation was also considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji , Samoa , and Hawaii itself . The plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of the American reaction and poor initial dispositions . Most significantly , American cryptographers were able to determine the date and location of the planned attack , enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to prepare its own ambush . Four Japanese and three American aircraft carriers participated in the battle . The four Japanese fleet carriers - Akagi , Kaga , S\u014dry\u016b and Hiry\u016b , part of the six-carrier force that had attacked Pearl Harbor six months earlier - were sunk , as was the heavy cruiser Mikuma .

It comprised the U.S. VI Corps , the British X Corps and the US 82nd Airborne Division , a total of about nine divisions . Its primary objectives were to seize the port of Naples to ensure resupply , and to cut across to the east coast , trapping the Axis troops further south . In order to draw troops away from the landing ground , Operation Baytown was mounted . This was a landing by the British Eighth Army in Calabria in the 'toe ' of Italy , on 3 September . Simultaneous sea landings were made by the British 1st Airborne Division at the port of Taranto ( Operation Slapstick ) . British General Bernard Montgomery had predicted Baytown would be a waste of effort because it assumed the Germans would give battle in Calabria ; if they failed to do so , the diversion would not work .

  "/wiki/Operation_Dragoon": "Operation Dragoon ( initially Operation Anvil ) was the code name for the landing operation of the Allied invasion of Provence ( Southern France ) on 15 August 1944 . The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord , the Allied landing in Normandy , but the lack of available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing . By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered , as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces . Concurrently , the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops . As a result , the operation was finally approved in July to be executed in August . The goal of the invasion was to secure the vital ports on the French Mediterranean coast and increase pressure on the German forces by opening another front . After some preliminary commando operations , the US VI Corps landed on the beaches of the C\u00f4te d'Azur under the shield of a large naval task force , followed by several divisions of the French Army B . They were opposed by the scattered forces of the German Army Group G , which had been weakened by the relocation of its divisions to other fronts and the replacement of its soldiers with third-rate Ostlegionen outfitted with obsolete equipment . Hindered by total Allied air superiority and a large-scale uprising by the French Resistance , the weak German forces were swiftly defeated . The Germans withdrew to the north through the Rh\u00f4ne valley , to establish a stable defense line at Dijon . Allied mobile units were able to overtake the Germans and partially block their route at the town of Mont\u00e9limar .

Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War .

It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic . To its south-west lies the small island of Navassa Island , which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration . Haiti is 27,750 square kilometers ( 10,714 sq mi ) in size and has an estimated population of 11.1 million , making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Cuba . The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , who migrated from South America . The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue . French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations , worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa , which made the colony one of the richest in the world .
