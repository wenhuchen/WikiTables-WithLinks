This area of the Mesabi Range was explored in 1893-1894 , shortly after the Mountain Iron mine was established in 1892 . The early development was as an underground mine , but open cast mining soon proved to be a better choice because of the soft , shallow ore deposits . Many open pits in the area soon merged into one large mine , and the consolidation of mines led to the formation of U.S. Steel in 1901 . The growth of the mine even resulted in the town of Hibbing being relocated to accommodate expansion",
