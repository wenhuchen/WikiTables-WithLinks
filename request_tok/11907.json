Born and raised in La Goulette , a neighbourhood of Tunis , Cardinale won the Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia competition in 1957 , the prize being a trip to Italy , which quickly led to film contracts , due above all to the involvement of Franco Cristaldi , who acted as her mentor for a number of years and later married her . After making her debut in a minor role with Omar Sharif in Goha ( 1958 ) , Cardinale became one of the best-known actresses in Italy after roles in films such as Rocco and His Brothers ( 1960 ) , Girl with a Suitcase ( 1961 ) , Cartouche ( 1962 ) , The Leopard ( 1963 ) , and Fellini 's 8\u00bd ( 1963 ) .
