  "/wiki/SUVs": "Sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) is a category of motor vehicles that combine elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles , such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive . There is no commonly agreed definition of an SUV , and usage varies between countries . Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis ; however , broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV . A crossover SUV is defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction ( as per passenger cars ) , however in many cases crossovers are simply referred to as SUVs . In some countries - such as the United States - SUVs have been classified as light trucks , resulting in more lenient regulations compared to passenger cars . The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s , and the four-wheel drive station wagons and carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949 . The 1984 Jeep Cherokee ( XJ ) is considered to be the first SUV in the modern style . Most SUVs produced today use unibody construction ( as per passenger cars ) ; however , in the past many SUVs used body-on-frame construction . During the late 1990s and early 2000s , the popularity of SUVs greatly increased , often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons . More recently , smaller SUVs , mid-size and crossovers have become increasingly popular . SUVs are currently the world 's largest automotive segment and accounted for 36.8% of the world 's passenger car market in 2017 . SUVs are criticised for their impact on other road users and the environment .",

Green vehicles can be powered by alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies and include hybrid electric vehicles , plug-in hybrid electric vehicles , battery electric vehicles , compressed-air vehicles , hydrogen and fuel-cell vehicles , neat ethanol vehicles , flexible-fuel vehicles , natural gas vehicles , clean diesel vehicles , and some sources also include vehicles using blends of biodiesel and ethanol fuel or gasohol . In November 2016 , with an EPA-rated fuel economy of 136 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent ( mpg-e ) ( 1.7 L/100 km ) , the 2017 Hyundai Ioniq Electric became the most efficient EPA-certified vehicle considering all fuels and of all years , surpassing the 2014-2016 model year all-electric BMW i3 . Several author also include conventional motor vehicles with high fuel economy , as they consider that increasing fuel economy is the most cost-effective way to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector in the short run . As part of their contribution to sustainable transport , these vehicles reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions , and contribute to energy independence by reducing oil imports . An environmental analysis extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions . A life-cycle assessment involves production and post-use considerations . A cradle-to-cradle design is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency .",
