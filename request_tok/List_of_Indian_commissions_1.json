The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 ( Sanskrit : great-souled , venerable ) , first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa , is now used throughout the world . Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat , western India , Gandhi was trained in law at the Inner Temple , London , and called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891 . After two uncertain years in India , where he was unable to start a successful law practice , he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit . He went on to stay for 21 years . It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family , and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights . In 1915 , aged 45 , he returned to India . He set about organising peasants , farmers , and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination . Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 , Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty , expanding women 's rights , building religious and ethnic amity , ending untouchability , and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule . The same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth , or short dhoti and , in the winter , a shawl , both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel , or charkha , as a mark of identification with India 's rural poor . Thereafter , he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community , ate simple vegetarian food , and undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification and political protest . Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians , Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km ( 250 mi ) Dandi Salt March in 1930 , and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942 .",

  "/wiki/Mandal_Commission": "The Mandal Commission , or the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Commission ( SEBC ) , was established in India on 1 January 1979 by the Janata Party government under Prime Minister Morarji Desai with a mandate to identify the socially or educationally backward classes of India . It was headed by the late B.P . Mandal an Indian parliamentarian , to consider the question of reservations for people to redress caste discrimination , and used eleven social , economic , and educational indicators to determine backwardness . In 1980 , based on its rationale that OBCs ( Other backward classes ) identified on the basis of caste , economic and social indicators comprised 52% of India 's population , the Commission 's report recommended that members of Other Backward Classes ( OBC ) be granted reservations to 27% of jobs under the Central government and public sector undertakings , thus making the total number of reservations for SC , ST and OBC to 49% . Though the report had been completed in 1983 , the V.P . Singh government declared its intent to implement the report in August 1990 , leading to widespread student protests . The Indian public at large was not informed of the important details of the report , namely that it applied only to the 5% jobs that existed in the public sector , and that the report considered 55% of India 's population as belonging to other backward classes due to their poor economic and socio cultural background . Opposition political parties , including the Congress and BJP and their youth wings ( which were active in all universities and colleges ) and groups of self interest were able to instigate the youth to protest in large numbers in the nation 's campuses , resulting in self immolations by students . It was thereafter provided a temporary stay order by the Supreme court , but implemented in 1992 in the central government for jobs in central government public sector undertakings . Interestingly , even before Mandal commission , some Indian states already had high reservations for economically low income people , namely OBCs ( other backward classes ) . For example , in 1980 , the state of Karnataka had reserved 48% for socially and educationally backward classes ( including SC , ST and OBCs ) , with a further 18% reserved for other weaker sections .",

Government estimates project that about 2,800 Sikhs were killed in Delhi and 3,350 nationwide , whilst independent sources estimate the number of deaths at about 8,000-17,000 Violence continued in the early 1980s because of the armed Sikh separatist Khalistan movement which sought independence from India .

Bhindranwale later on made the sacred temple complex an armoury and headquarters .

It has been a focus of dispute between the Hindu and Muslim communities since the 18th century . According to the mosque 's inscriptions , it was built in 1528-29 ( 935 AH ) by general Mir Baqi , on orders of the Mughal emperor Babur . The mosque was attacked and demolished by Hindu Karsevaks in 1992 and ignited communal violence across the country . The mosque was located on a hill known as Ramkot ( Rama 's fort ) . According to Hindus , Baqi destroyed a pre-existing temple of Rama at the site . The existence of the temple itself is a matter of controversy . In 2003 , a report by the Archaeological Survey of India suggested that there appears to have existed an old structure at the site . Starting in the 19th century , there were several conflicts and court disputes between Hindus and Muslims over the mosque . In 1949 Hindu activists associated with the Hindu Mahasabha surreptitiously placed idols of Rama inside the mosque , after which the government locked the building to avoid further disputes . Court cases were filed by both Hindus and Muslims asking for access . On 6 December 1992 , a large group of Hindu activists belonging to the Vishva Hindu Parishad and allied organisations demolished the mosque , triggering riots all over India , killing around 2,000 people , many of them Muslim .",

Officially issued by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed under Article 352 of the Constitution because of the prevailing internal disturbance , the Emergency was in effect from 26 June 1975 until its withdrawal in January 1977 . The order bestowed upon the Prime Minister the authority to rule by decree , allowing elections to be suspended and civil liberties to be curbed . For much of the Emergency , most of Gandhi 's political opponents were imprisoned and the press was censored . Several other human rights violations were reported from the time , including a forced mass-sterilization campaign spearheaded by Sanjay Gandhi , the Prime Minister 's son . The Emergency is one of the most controversial periods of independent India 's history . The final decision to impose an emergency was proposed by Indira Gandhi , agreed upon by the president of India , and thereafter ratified by the cabinet and the parliament ( from July to August 1975 ) , based on the rationale that there were imminent internal and external threats to the Indian state ."
