Biddle would continue to serve as the bank 's president for several years , during which time he exercised power over the nation 's money supply and interest rates , seeking to prevent economic crises . At the request of Henry Clay and other Whigs , Biddle asked Democratic President Andrew Jackson to renew the bank 's federal charter in 1832 . Jackson , who held a deep hostility to many banks , declined to renew the charter , beginning a political debate known as the Bank War .

Modeled on Alexander Hamilton 's First Bank of the United States , the Second Bank was chartered by President James Madison in 1816 and began operations at its main branch in Philadelphia on January 7 , 1817 , managing twenty-five branch offices nationwide by 1832 . The efforts to renew the bank 's charter put the institution at the center of the general election of 1832 , in which the bank 's president Nicholas Biddle and pro-bank National Republicans led by Henry Clay clashed with the hard-money Andrew Jackson administration and eastern banking interests in the Bank War . Failing to secure recharter , the Second Bank of the United States became a private corporation in 1836 , and underwent liquidation in 1841 .",

  "/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund": "The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is an international organization headquartered in Washington , D.C. , consisting of 189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation , secure financial stability , facilitate international trade , promote high employment and sustainable economic growth , and reduce poverty around the world while periodically depending on the World Bank for its resources . Formed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes , it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international payment system . It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises . Countries contribute funds to a pool through a quota system from which countries experiencing balance of payments problems can borrow money . As of 2016 [ update ] , the fund had XDR 477 billion ( about US $ 667 billion ) . Through the fund and other activities such as the gathering of statistics and analysis , surveillance of its members ' economies , and the demand for particular policies , the IMF works to improve the economies of its member countries . The organization 's objectives stated in the Articles of Agreement are : to promote international monetary co-operation , international trade , high employment , exchange-rate stability , sustainable economic growth , and making resources available to member countries in financial difficulty . IMF funds come from two major sources : quotas and loans . Quotas , which are pooled funds of member nations , generate most IMF funds . The size of a member 's quota depends on its economic and financial importance in the world . Nations with larger economic importance have larger quotas . The quotas are increased periodically as a means of boosting the IMF 's resources in the form of special drawing rights ."
