  "/wiki/Fast_food": "Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on speed of service versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science . Fast food was originally created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters , travelers and wage workers who often did not have the time to sit down at a public house or diner and wait for their meal . By making speed of service the priority , this ensured that customers with strictly limited time ( a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family , for example , or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break ) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot ( as is expected from a traditional sit down restaurant ) . For those with no time to spare , fast food became a multibillion-dollar industry . In 2018 , the fast food industry was worth an estimated $ 570 billion globally . The fastest form of fast food consists of pre-cooked meals kept in readiness for a customer 's arrival ( Boston Market rotisserie chicken , Little Caesars pizza , etc . ) , with waiting time reduced to mere seconds . Other fast food outlets , primarily the hamburger outlets ( McDonald 's , Burger King , etc . ) use mass-produced pre-prepared ingredients ( bagged buns & condiments , frozen beef patties , prewashed/sliced vegetables , etc . ) but take great pains to point out to the customer that the meat and potatoes ( hamburgers and french fries ) are always cooked fresh ( or at least relatively recently ) and assembled to order ( like at a diner ) . Although a vast variety of food can be cooked fast , fast food is a commercial term limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen , preheated or precooked ingredients , and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away . Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a drive-through .",

  "/wiki/Spanferkel": "A suckling pig is a piglet fed on its mother 's milk ( i.e. , a piglet which is still a suckling ) . In culinary contexts , a suckling pig is slaughtered between the ages of two and six weeks . It is traditionally cooked whole , often roasted , in various cuisines . It is usually prepared for special occasions and gatherings . The meat from suckling pig is pale and tender and the cooked skin is crisp and can be used for pork rinds . The texture of the meat can be somewhat gelatinous due to the amount of collagen in a young pig ."
