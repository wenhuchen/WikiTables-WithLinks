The system was released in Brazil on August 30 , 1993 , by Playtronic . Although each version is essentially the same , several forms of regional lockout prevent the different cartridges from being compatible with one another . The SNES is Nintendo 's second programmable home console , following the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time . The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of a variety of enhancement chips integrated in game cartridges to be competitive into the next generation . The SNES was a global success , becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from Sega 's Genesis console in North America and Europe . Overlapping the NES 's 61.9 million unit sales , the SNES remained popular well into the 32-bit era , with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003 . It continues to be popular among collectors and retro gamers , with new homebrew games and Nintendo 's emulated rereleases , such as on the Virtual Console , the Super NES Classic Edition , and Nintendo Switch Online .",
  "/wiki/999:_Nine_Hours,_Nine_Persons,_Nine_Doors": "Nine Hours , Nine Persons , Nine Doors [ a ] is an adventure video game developed by Chunsoft . It is the first installment in the Zero Escape series , and was released in Japan in 2009 and in North America in 2010 for the Nintendo DS . The story follows Junpei , a college student who is abducted along with eight other people and forced to play the Nonary Game , which puts its participants in a life-or-death situation , to escape from a sinking cruise liner . The gameplay alternates between two types of sections : Escape sections , where the player completes puzzles in escape-the-room scenarios ; and Novel sections , where the player reads the game 's narrative and makes decisions that influence the story toward one of six different endings . Development of the game began after Uchikoshi joined Chunsoft to write a visual novel for them that could reach a wider audience ; Uchikoshi suggested adding puzzle elements that are integrated with the game 's story . The inspiration for the story was the question of where inspiration comes from ; while researching it , Uchikoshi came across Rupert Sheldrake 's morphic resonance hypothesis , which became the main focus of the game 's science fiction elements . The music was composed by Shinji Hosoe , while the characters were designed by Kinu Nishimura . The localization was handled by Aksys Games ; they worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version , aiming for natural-sounding English rather than following the original 's exact wording . Nine Hours , Nine Persons , Nine Doors was positively received , with reviewers praising the story , writing and puzzles , but criticizing the game 's tone and how the player is required to re-do the puzzles every time they play through the game ( which is necessary in order to obtain the true ending ) . While the Japanese release was a commercial failure , the game sold better than expected for the genre in the United States . Although Nine Hours , Nine Persons , Nine Doors was developed as a stand-alone title , its unexpected critical success in North America prompted the continuation of the series . The sequel , Zero Escape : Virtue 's Last Reward , was released in 2012 , which was followed by Zero Time Dilemma , released in 2016 .",

The DS , an acronym for Developers ' System or Dual Screen , introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming : two LCD screens working in tandem ( the bottom one being a touchscreen ) , a built-in microphone , and support for wireless connectivity . Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP . The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network . Alternatively , they could interact online using the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service . Its main competitor was Sony 's PlayStation Portable during the seventh generation of video game consoles . Prior to its release , the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental , third pillar in Nintendo 's console lineup , meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube . However , backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to the Game Boy series . On March 2 , 2006 , Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite , a slimmer and lighter redesign of the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens . On November 1 , 2008 , Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi , another redesign with several hardware improvements and new features , although it lost backwards compatibility for Game Boy Advance titles .

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) .

All of the machines in the family are technically similar and differ primarily in packaging . They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz , [ a ] and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips . This architecture enabled graphics and sound capabilities more advanced than most contemporary machines , and gaming on the platform was a major draw . The first-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform 's killer app . The systems launched with a series of plug and play peripherals that used the Atari SIO serial bus system , an early analog of USB . [ b ] To meet stringent FCC requirements , much of the circuitry of the original machines is enclosed in a cast aluminum block , which made them physically robust but expensive to produce . The 400 and 800 were replaced by the XL series in 1983 , then-after the company was sold and reestablished as Atari Corporation-the XE models in 1985 . The XL and XE are lighter in construction and less expensive to build , while also having Atari BASIC built-in and reducing the number of joystick ports from 4 to 2 . The 130XE , released in 1985 , increased the memory to 128K of bank-switched RAM .

The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface , built-in screen , and mouse . Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993 . Early Macintosh models were expensive , hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper Commodore 64 for consumers , as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses . Although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac . Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing , making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade . In the early 1990s , Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time . However , the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel 's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks , gradually took market share from Apple , and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer . Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s , the falling prices of commodity PC components , poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa , and the release of Windows 95 contributed to some decline of the Macintosh user base . Upon his return , Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 ( including models made for specific regions ) down to four in mid-1999 : the Power Macintosh G3 , iMac , 14.1 PowerBook G3 , and 12 iBook . All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance , competitive prices and aesthetic designs , and helped return Apple to profitability . Around this time , Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of Mac , a nickname that had been in common use since the development of the first model .",

  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers .",

The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services , including the PlayStation Network , as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console , through its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita . In September 2009 , the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released . It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games . It was lighter and thinner than the original version , and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design , as well as a minor start-up change in software . A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012 , further refining and redesigning the console . During its early years , the system was negatively received , due to its high price ( $ 599 for a 60 gigabyte model , $ 499 for a 20 GB model ) , a complex processor architecture , and lack of quality games but was praised for its Blu-ray capabilities and untapped potential .",

Available in free and subscription-based varieties , Xbox Live allows users to : play games online ; download games ( through Xbox Live Arcade ) and game demos ; purchase and stream music , television programs , and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals ; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications . In addition to online multimedia features , it allows users to stream media from local PCs . Several peripherals have been released , including wireless controllers , expanded hard drive storage , and the Kinect motion sensing camera . The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia , turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment . Launched worldwide across 2005-2006 , the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions , including North America and Europe . The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate , indicated by the so-called Red Ring of Death , necessitating an extension of the device 's warranty period . Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console : the Xbox 360 S in 2010 , and the Xbox 360 E in 2013 .",

  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",

It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",

Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources . It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI . It is a flexible operating system , and consumes negligible installation space .",

  "/wiki/Action-adventure_game": "Action-adventure is a video game genre that combines core elements from both the action game and adventure game genres . With the decline of the adventure game genre from mainstream popularity in the early 2000s , the use of the term ( and the hybrid term action-adventure ) has been more liberal . It is not uncommon for gamers to apply the term adventure or action to describe the genre of fiction to which a game belongs , and not the gameplay itself . Action-adventure is a hybrid genre , and thus the definition is very inclusive , leading it to be perhaps the broadest genre of video games , and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres . Typically , pure adventure games have situational problems for the player to solve , with very little or no action . If there is action , it is generally confined to isolated minigames . Pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge the reflexes .

Infinite is the third installment in the BioShock series , and though it is not immediately part of the storyline of previous BioShock games , it features similar gameplay concepts and themes . Irrational Games and creative director Ken Levine based the game 's setting on historical events at the turn of the 20th century , such as the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition , and based the story on the concept of American exceptionalism , while also incorporating influences from more recent events at the time such as the 2011 Occupy movement . The game is set in the year 1912 and follows its protagonist , former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt , who is sent to the airborne city of Columbia to find a young woman , Elizabeth , who has been held captive there for most of her life . Though Booker rescues Elizabeth , the two become involved with the city 's warring factions : the nativist and elite Founders that rule Columbia and strive to keep its privileges for White Americans , and the Vox Populi , underground rebels representing the underclass of the city . During this conflict , Booker learns that Elizabeth possesses strange powers to manipulate Tears in the space-time continuum that ravage Columbia , and soon discovers her to be central to the city 's dark secrets . The player controls Booker Dewitt throughout the game , eventually working with the AI-controlled Elizabeth . Like previous BioShock games , the player uses a combination of weapons , clothing called Gear that offer unique attributes , and psychokinetic powers granted through Vigors . Elizabeth 's powers can also be used to help fight hostile forces . In contrast to the limited spaces of the underwater city of Rapture , the openness of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat , including combat that takes place aboard the city 's Sky-Line roller coaster-like rail system .

It was also noted for its PC-like size and weight , and was the first console to feature a built-in hard disk . In November 2002 , Microsoft launched Xbox Live , a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection . Unlike online services from Sega and Sony , Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port . The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth-generation of consoles . The popularity of blockbuster titles such as Bungie 's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming , and in particular first-person shooters . The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America , selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001 , aided by the popularity of one of the system 's launch titles , Halo : Combat Evolved , which sold a million units by April 2002 .
