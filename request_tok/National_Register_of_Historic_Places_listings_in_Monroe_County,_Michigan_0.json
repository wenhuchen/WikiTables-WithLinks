  "/wiki/George_Armstrong_Custer_Equestrian_Monument": "The George Armstrong Custer Equestrian Monument , also known as Sighting the Enemy , is an equestrian statue of General George Armstrong Custer located in Monroe , Michigan . The statue was designated as a Michigan Historic Site on June 15 , 1992 and soon after listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 9 , 1994 . While Custer was not born in Monroe , he lived much of his early childhood there with relatives and attended the schools in Monroe . During his youth , he met his future wife Elizabeth Bacon , whom he returned to marry in 1864 . Custer left Monroe to attend the United States Military Academy and fight in the Civil War . Because of his hard work and success during the war - as well as the Union 's need for officers - he was promoted to the rank of Major General and became a very well-known military figure . After the Civil War , he fought in the Indian Wars in the West . His previous accomplishments in the Civil War , however , were overshadowed by his catastrophic defeat and death at the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25 , 1876 . To honor him , a $ 24,000 , 14-foot ( 4.27 m ) bronze equestrian statue , sculpted by Edward Clark Potter , was unveiled in Monroe in June 1910 by President William Howard Taft and the widowed Elizabeth Bacon Custer . The statue commemorates his successful actions during the Civil War and not his more well-known defeat in 1876 .",
  "/wiki/Monroe,_Michigan": "Monroe is the largest city and county seat of Monroe County in the U.S. state of Michigan . Monroe had a population of 20,733 in the 2010 census . Located on the western shores of Lake Erie , the city is bordered on the south by Monroe Charter Township , but the two are administered autonomously . Monroe is located approximately 14 miles ( 23 km ) north of Toledo , Ohio and 25 miles ( 40 km ) south of Detroit . The U.S. Census Bureau lists Monroe as the core city in the Monroe Metropolitan Statistical Area , which is conterminous with Monroe County and had a population of 152,021 in 2010 . Monroe is officially part of the Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint combined statistical area . The Monroe area was the scene of several military conflicts during the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom and is best remembered for the Battle of Frenchtown . In 1817 , portions of the Frenchtown settlement along the River Raisin were platted and renamed Monroe after then-president James Monroe . When Michigan became a state in 1837 , Monroe was incorporated as a city . Monroe is known as the childhood residence of George Armstrong Custer and other members of his family , including his brother Boston Custer and wife Elizabeth Bacon . Several structures are named after Custer , including Custer Airport . The city also contains numerous other historic structures .",
  "/wiki/George_Armstrong_Custer": "George Armstrong Custer ( December 5 , 1839 - June 25 , 1876 ) was a United States Army officer and cavalry commander in the American Civil War and the American Indian Wars . Custer graduated from West Point in 1861 at the bottom of his class , but as the Civil War was just starting , trained officers were in immediate demand . He worked closely with General McClellan and the future General Pleasonton , both of whom recognized his qualities as a cavalry leader , and he was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers at age 23 . Only a few days after his promotion , he fought at Gettysburg , where he commanded the Michigan Cavalry Brigade and despite being outnumbered , defeated J. E. B. Stuart 's attack at what is now known as the East Cavalry Field . In 1864 , Custer served in the Overland Campaign and in Sheridan 's army in the Shenandoah Valley , defeating Jubal Early at Cedar Creek . His division blocked the Army of Northern Virginia 's final retreat and received the first flag of truce from the Confederates , and Custer was present at Robert E. Lee 's surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox . After the war , Custer was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army and was sent west to fight in the Indian Wars . On June 25 , 1876 , while leading the 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana Territory against a coalition of Native American tribes , he was killed along with all of his command during an action later romanticized as Custer 's Last Stand . His dramatic end was as controversial as the rest of his career , and reaction to his life and career remains deeply divided . Custer 's bold leadership in battle is unquestioned , but his legend was partly of his own fabrication through his extensive journalism , and perhaps more through the energetic lobbying of his wife Libbie Custer throughout her long widowhood .",

Taft was elected president in 1908 , the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt , but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after Roosevelt split the Republican vote by running as a third-party candidate . In 1921 , President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft to be chief justice , a position in which he served until a month before his death . Taft was born in Cincinnati , Ohio in 1857 . His father , Alphonso Taft , was a U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of War . Taft attended Yale and , like his father , was a member of Skull and Bones . After becoming a lawyer , Taft was appointed a judge while still in his twenties . He continued a rapid rise , being named Solicitor General and as a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals . In 1901 , President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines . In 1904 , Roosevelt made him Secretary of War , and he became Roosevelt 's hand-picked successor . Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice , Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States , believing his political work to be more important . With Roosevelt 's help , Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency in that November 's election .",

She spent most of their marriage in relatively close proximity to him despite his numerous military campaigns in the American Civil War and subsequent postings on the Great Plains as a commanding officer in the United States Cavalry . Left nearly destitute in the aftermath of her husband 's death , she became an outspoken advocate for his legacy through her popular books and lectures . Largely as a result of her decades of campaigning on his behalf , General Custer 's iconic image as the gallant fallen hero amid the glory of Custer 's Last Stand was a canon of American history for almost a century after his death . Elizabeth Custer never remarried and reached age 90 when she died in 1933 , only four days short of her 91st birthday . She has been portrayed by a number of actresses , starting in the 1940s in films and on television .",

It is the southernmost , shallowest , and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time . At its deepest point Lake Erie is 210 feet ( 64 metres ) deep . Situated on the International Boundary between Canada and the United States , Lake Erie 's northern shore is the Canadian province of Ontario , specifically the Ontario Peninsula , with the U.S. states of Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York on its western , southern , and eastern shores . These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries . The lake was named by the Erie people , a Native American people who lived along its southern shore . The tribal name erie is a shortened form of the Iroquoian word erielhonan , meaning long tail . Situated below Lake Huron , Erie 's primary inlet is the Detroit River . The main natural outflow from the lake is via the Niagara River , which provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U.S. as it spins huge turbines near Niagara Falls at Lewiston , New York and Queenston , Ontario . Some outflow occurs via the Welland Canal , part of the St. Lawrence Seaway , which diverts water for ship passages from Port Colborne , Ontario on Lake Erie , to St. Catharines on Lake Ontario , an elevation difference of 326 ft ( 99 m ) . Lake Erie 's environmental health has been an ongoing concern for decades , with issues such as overfishing , pollution , algae blooms , and eutrophication generating headlines .",

It consists of 4,040 acres ( 16.3 km2 ) of coastal wetlands in Lake Erie near the mouth of the Huron River . The game area occupies only a tiny area of land on the other side of the Huron River in Wayne County , where its headquarters are located at 37205 Mouillee Road , Route 2 in Brownstown Charter Township . It is used for waterfowl hunting due to its heavy use by ducks and geese along the flyway across Lake Erie . The park is mostly utilized by bird watchers hiking or biking along the dikes or hunters in small boats . Many muskrats are taken yearly by trappers in the area . The Downriver area Catholics had a tradition of eating muskrat under a traditional exemption to the eating of meat during Lent . The area was named by French fur traders in the 17th century . Mouillee is a most appropriate name for the place , as the word ( mouill\u00e9e ) is the feminine form of mouill\u00e9 , which means wet or moist . In 1875 , a group of wealthy local men bought about 2,000 acres ( 8.1 km2 ) and established the Pointe Mouillee Shooting Club , which employed punters and cooks to assist the duck hunters . In 1945 , the state of Michigan bought 2,600 acres ( 11 km2 ) from the club to establish the state game area . It added more property to the park , including 130-acre ( 0.53 km2 ) Celeron Island .",

This area is commonly referred to as the downtown area of Dundee and was settled almost concurrently with the Old Village Historic District in nearby Monroe . Both were built in their respective locations due to the River Raisin . Originally , the buildings within the district were small , wood buildings , but these were eventually replaced with two-story , brick storefronts . Most of the surviving buildings were built between 1866-1900 , although the district traces its origins to Dundee 's establishment in 1825 . The district itself is located about one mile east of US-23 along M-50 ( known locally as West Monroe Street east of the river and Tecumseh Street to the west of the river ) at the bend of the River Raisin . The majority of the district is on the north side of the river - including Riley , Ypsilanti , East Main , and Tecumseh Streets . South of the river includes a small portion of West Monroe and Toledo Streets . The district is colloquially known as the Triangle District for the unique shape of the grid plan where Riley and Tecumseh streets intersect at a 45\u00b0 angle to produce a triangular piece of land cut off by Park Place on the west .

  "/wiki/Grid_plan": "The grid plan , grid street plan , or gridiron plan is a type of city plan in which streets run at right angles to each other , forming a grid . The infrastructure cost for regular grid patterns is generally higher than for patterns with discontinuous streets . Costs for streets depend largely on four variables : street width , street length , block width and pavement width . Two inherent characteristics of the grid plan , frequent intersections and orthogonal geometry , facilitate pedestrian movement . The geometry helps with orientation and wayfinding and its frequent intersections with the choice and directness of route to desired destinations . In ancient Rome , the grid plan method of land measurement was called centuriation . The grid plan dates from antiquity and originated in multiple cultures ; some of the earliest planned cities were built using grid plans .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Sawmill": "A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber . Modern saw mills use a motorized saw to cut logs lengthwise to make long pieces , and crosswise to length depending on standard or custom sizes ( dimensional lumber ) . The portable saw mill is iconic and of simple operation - the logs lay flat on a steel bed and the motorized saw cuts the log horizontally along the length of the bed , by the operator manually pushing the saw . The most basic kind of saw mill consists of a chainsaw and a customized jig ( Alaskan saw mill ) , with similar horizontal operation . Before the invention of the sawmill , boards were made in various manual ways , either rived ( split ) and planed , hewn , or more often hand sawn by two men with a whipsaw , one above and another in a saw pit below . The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill , a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis , Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD . Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa , the Middle East and Central Asia , and in the next few centuries , spread across Europe . The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade . Generally , only the saw was powered , and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand . An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage , also water powered , to move the log steadily through the saw blade . By the time of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century , the circular saw blade had been invented , and with the development of steam power in the 19th century , a much greater degree of mechanisation was possible . Scrap lumber from the mill provided a source of fuel for firing the boiler .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Frenchtown": "The Battles of Frenchtown , also known as the Battle of the River Raisin and the River Raisin Massacre , was a series of conflicts in Michigan Territory that took place from January 18-23 , 1813 , during the War of 1812 . It was fought between the United States and a British and Native American alliance near the River Raisin in Frenchtown , ( present-day Monroe , Michigan ) . On January 18 , 1813 , the Americans forced the retreat of the British and their Native American allies from Frenchtown , which they had earlier occupied , in a relatively minor skirmish . The movement was part of a larger United States plan to advance north and retake Fort Detroit , following its loss in the Siege of Detroit the previous summer . Despite this initial success , the British and Native Americans rallied and launched a surprise counterattack four days later on January 22 . Ill-prepared , the Americans lost 397 soldiers in this second battle , while 547 were taken prisoner . Dozens of wounded prisoners were murdered the next day in a massacre by the Native Americans . More prisoners were killed if they could not keep up on the forced march to Fort Malden . This was the deadliest conflict recorded on Michigan soil , and the casualties included the highest number of Americans killed in a single battle during the War of 1812 . Parts of the original battlefield were designated as a state historic park and added to the National Register of Historic Places .

  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

The property was given to Navarre from the native Potawatomi tribe and served as the center of the new settlement . The Navarre House was famously used as the military headquarters for James Winchester , who commanded his troops during the ill-fated Battle of Frenchtown during the War of 1812 . The house had several different owners , but its namesake comes from Dr. Alfred Sawyer , who was a famous early proponents of homeopathy . Dr. Sawyer lived on the property from 1859-1870 .
