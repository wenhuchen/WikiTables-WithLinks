  "/wiki/Tigerstripe": "Tigerstripe is the name of a group of camouflage patterns developed for close-range use in dense jungle during jungle warfare by the South Vietnamese Armed Forces and adopted in 1964 by US Special Forces during the Vietnam War . During and following the Vietnam war the pattern was adopted by several other Asian countries . It derives its name from its resemblance to a tiger 's stripes and were simply called tigers . It features narrow stripes that look like brush-strokes of green and brown , and broader brush-strokes of black printed over a lighter shade of olive or khaki . The brush-strokes interlock rather than overlap , as in French Lizard pattern ( TAP47 ) from which it apparently derives . There are many variations ; R.D . Johnson counted at least 19 different versions in early drafts of Tiger Patterns , his definitive work on the subject , although it is unclear if these are all different print patterns , or if they include color variations of a few different print patterns .",
  "/wiki/Indian_dress": "Clothing in India changes depending on the different ethnicity , geography , climate , and cultural traditions of the people of each region of India . Historically , male and female clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina , langota , dhoti , lungi , sari , gamcha , and loincloths to cover the body into elaborate costumes not only used in daily wear , but also on festive occasions , as well as rituals and dance performances . In urban areas , western clothing is common and uniformly worn by people of all social levels . India also has a great diversity in terms of weaves , fibers , colours , and material of clothing . Sometimes , color codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and ritual concerned . The clothing in India also encompasses the wide variety of Indian embroidery , prints , handwork , embellishment , styles of wearing cloths . A wide mix of Indian traditional clothing and western styles can be seen in India .",
  "/wiki/Navy_Working_Uniform": "The Navy Working Uniform ( NWU ) is a series of military uniforms that are currently used by the United States Navy ( and some elements of the U.S. Coast Guard ) for wear by its members . The NWU is a working uniform , which means that is made to a more durable and utilitarian standard , thus being worn in lieu of more formal and delicate uniforms that might get unduly damaged or dirtied in the process of normal military duties . Made from a ripstop nylon-cotton blend , there are currently two variants of the NWU in use by the U.S. Navy . They are the NWU Type II , which is primarily brown and tan and is designed to be worn in sandy , arid , and desert battlefield environments , and the NWU Type III , which is primarily black and green in hue and is designed to be worn in more temperate environments such as the contiguous United States . The first NWU variant , known as the NWU Type I , was designed in late 2004 and began being used by the U.S. Navy in limited quantities beginning in late 2008 . By late 2010 , it had completely replaced most other working uniforms . Though the NWU Type I was originally intended for shipboard use , it soon was dropped from that role when it was realized that the uniforms were not suitable for such duties due to their lack of flame resistance , as fires are a serious threat to sailors aboard a warship . Instead , the U.S. Navy 's sailors wear specialized flame-resistant coveralls when working shipboard . Due to its lack of flame resistance making it unsuitable for shipboard use , the NWU Type I was retired from use in 2019 , being replaced by the NWU Type III . The NWU Type II is worn by specialized units such as the Navy SEALs , Seabees , and Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen , whereas the NWU Type III are worn by all U.S. Navy sailors , regardless of rank or billet . The NWU Type III has been issued to new naval recruits since late 2017 and will completely replace the NWU Type I in 2019 , when the latter will be discontinued and phased out of service .",
  "/wiki/Multi-scale_camouflage": "Multi-scale camouflage is a type of military camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales , often ( though not necessarily ) with a digital camouflage pattern created with computer assistance . The function is to provide camouflage over a range of distances , or equivalently over a range of scales ( scale-invariant camouflage ) , in the manner of fractals , so some approaches are called fractal camouflage . Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels , even if they were designed using a computer . Further , not all pixellated patterns work at different scales , so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance . The first standardized pattern to be issued was the single-scale Italian telo mimetico . The root of the modern multi-scale camouflage patterns can be traced back to 1930s experiments in Europe for the German and Soviet armies . This was followed by Canadian development of Canadian Disruptive Pattern ( CADPAT ) , first issued in 2002 , and then with US work which created Marine pattern ( MARPAT ) , launched between 2002 and 2004 .",

Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",

The NVA was formed on 1 March 1956 to succeed the Kasernierte Volkspolizei ( Barracked People 's Police ) and influenced by the Soviet Army , becoming one of the Warsaw Pact militaries opposing NATO during the Cold War . The majority of NATO officers rated the NVA the best military in the Warsaw Pact based on discipline , thoroughness of training , and the quality of officer leadership . The NVA did not see significant combat but participated in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 , deployed military advisors to communist governments in other countries , and manned the Berlin Wall where they were responsible for numerous deaths .
