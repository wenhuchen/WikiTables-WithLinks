  "/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council": "The United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations ( UN ) , charged with ensuring international peace and security , recommending that the General Assembly accept new members to the United Nations , and approving any changes to its charter . Its powers include the establishment of peacekeeping operations and international sanctions as well as the authorization of military actions through resolutions - it is the only body of the United Nations with the authority to issue binding resolutions to member states . The council held its first session on 17 January 1946 . Like the UN as a whole , the Security Council was created following World War II to address the failings of a previous international organization , the League of Nations , in maintaining world peace . In its early decades , the Security Council was largely paralyzed by the Cold War division between the US and USSR and their respective allies , though it authorized interventions in the Korean War and the Congo Crisis and peacekeeping missions in the Suez Crisis , Cyprus , and West New Guinea . With the collapse of the Soviet Union , UN peacekeeping efforts increased dramatically in scale , and the Security Council authorized major military and peacekeeping missions in Kuwait , Namibia , Cambodia , Bosnia , Rwanda , Somalia , Sudan , and the Democratic Republic of Congo . The Security Council consists of fifteen members . The great powers that were the victors of World War II - the Soviet Union ( now represented by Russia ) , the United Kingdom , France , the former Republic of China ( now represented by the People 's Republic of China ) , and the United States - serve as the body 's five permanent members . These can veto any substantive resolution , including those on the admission of new member states or nominees for the office of Secretary-General . In addition , the council has 10 non-permanent members , elected on a regional basis to serve a term of two years . The body 's presidency rotates monthly among its members . Resolutions of the Security Council are typically enforced by UN peacekeepers , military forces voluntarily provided by member states and funded independently of the main UN budget .",
