M\u00f6lders was instrumental in the development of new fighter tactics that led to the finger-four formation . He died in an air crash in which he was a passenger . M\u00f6lders joined the Luftwaffe , the air force of Nazi Germany , in 1934 . In 1938 , he volunteered for service in the Condor Legion , which supported General Francisco Franco 's Nationalist side in the Spanish Civil War , and shot down 14 aircraft . With the start of World War II , he took part in the Phoney War , Battle of France , and the Battle of Britain .

  "/wiki/Military_reserve_force": "A military reserve force is a military organization composed of citizen-soldiers of a country who combine a military role or career with a civilian career . They are not normally kept under arms and their main role is to be available to fight when their military requires additional manpower . Reserve forces are generally considered part of a permanent standing body of armed forces . The existence of reserve forces allows a nation to reduce its peacetime military expenditures while maintaining a force prepared for war . It is analogous to the historical model of military recruitment before the era of standing armies . In some countries , such as Canada , United States , Spain and the United Kingdom , members of the reserve forces are civilians who maintain military skills by training , typically one weekend a month . They may do so as individuals or as members of standing reserve regiments , for example the Army Reserve of the United Kingdom . In some cases a militia , home guard , state guard , or State Military could constitute part of a military reserve forces , such as the United States National Guard , the Norwegian Home Guard , the Swedish Home Guard , or the Danish Home Guard . In Colombia , Israel , Norway , Singapore , South Korea , Sweden and Taiwan service in the reserves is compulsory for a number of years after one has completed national service .

  "/wiki/Hauptmann": "Hauptmann is a German word usually translated as captain when it is used as an officer 's rank in the German , Austrian , and Swiss armies . While Haupt in contemporary German means 'main ' , it also has and originally had the meaning of 'head ' , i.e .

It equates to the rank of captain in the British and US Armies , and is rated OF-2 in NATO . ( For the German maritime counterpart to captain , see Kapit\u00e4n . ) More generally , it can be used to denote the head of any hierarchically structured group of people , often as a compound word . For example , a Feuerwehrhauptmann is the captain of a fire brigade , while R\u00e4uberhauptmann refers to the leader of a gang of robbers . Official Austrian and German titles incorporating the word include Landeshauptmann , Bezirkshauptmann , Burghauptmann , and Berghauptmann . In Saxony during the Weimar Republic , the titles of Kreishauptmann , and Amtshauptmann were held by senior civil servants . Hauptmann ( from Early Modern High German Heubtmann ) is cognate with the Swedish h\u00f6vitsman , which also has the root meaning 'head-man ' or 'the man at the head ' , and is closely related to h\u00f6vding , meaning 'chieftain ' .
