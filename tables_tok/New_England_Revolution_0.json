  "intro": "The New England Revolution is an American professional soccer club based in the Greater Boston area that competes in Major League Soccer (MLS), in the Eastern Conference of the league. It is one of the ten charter clubs of MLS, having competed in the league since its inaugural season. The club is owned by Robert Kraft, who also owns the New England Patriots along with his son, Jonathan Kraft. The name Revolution refers to the New England region's significant involvement in the American Revolution that took place from 1775-1783. New England plays their home matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, located 21 miles (34 km) southwest of downtown Boston, Massachusetts. The club played their home games at the adjacent and now-demolished Foxboro Stadium, from 1996 until 2001. The Revs are the only original MLS team to have every league game in their history televised. The Revolution won their first major trophy in the 2007 U.S. Open Cup. The following year, they won the 2008 North American SuperLiga. The Revolution have participated in five MLS Cup finals in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2014. They also placed second in the 2005 regular season. However, they have never won an MLS Cup or MLS Supporters' Shield."
