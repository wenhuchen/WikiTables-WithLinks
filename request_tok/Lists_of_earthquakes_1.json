The earthquake is often referred to in Japan as the Great East Japan Earthquake ( \u6771\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u9707\u707d , Higashi nihon daishinsai ) [ fn 1 ] and is also known as the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake , the Great Sendai Earthquake , the Great T\u014dhoku Earthquake , and the 3.11 earthquake . It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan , and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900 . The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that may have reached heights of up to 40.5 meters ( 133 ft ) in Miyako in T\u014dhoku 's Iwate Prefecture , and which , in the Sendai area , traveled at 700 km/h ( 435 mph ) for up to 10 km ( 6 mi ) inland . Residents of Sendai had only eight to ten minutes of warning , and more than 19,000 were killed , many at evacuation sites , more than a hundred of which washed away . The earthquake moved Honshu ( the main island of Japan ) 2.4 m ( 8 ft ) east , shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm ( 4 in ) and 25 cm ( 10 in ) , increased earth 's rotational speed by 1.8 \u00b5s per day , and generated infrasound waves detected in perturbations of the low-orbiting GOCE satellite . Initially , the earthquake caused sinking of part of Honshu 's Pacific coast by up to roughly a metre , but after about three years , the coast rose back and kept on rising to exceed its original height . The tsunami swept the Japanese mainland and killed over ten thousand people , mainly through drowning , though blunt trauma also caused many deaths . The latest report from the Japanese National Police Agency report confirms 15,899 deaths , 6,157 injured , and 2,529 people missing across twenty prefectures , and a report from 2015 indicated 228,863 people were still living away from their home in either temporary housing or due to permanent relocation . A report by the National Police Agency of Japan on 10 September 2018 listed 121,778 buildings as total collapsed , with a further 280,926 buildings half collapsed , and another 699,180 buildings partially damaged . The earthquake and tsunami also caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern Japan , including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas , and a dam collapse . Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said , In the 65 years after the end of World War II , this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Sichuan 's capital city is Chengdu . The population of Sichuan stands at 81 million . In antiquity , Sichuan was the home of the ancient states of Ba and Shu . Their conquest by Qin strengthened it and paved the way for the Qin Shi Huang 's unification of China under the Qin dynasty . During the Three Kingdoms era , Liu Bei 's Shu was based in Sichuan . The area was devastated in the 17th century by Zhang Xianzhong 's rebellion and the area 's subsequent Manchu conquest , but recovered to become one of China 's most productive areas by the 19th century . During World War II , Chongqing served as the temporary capital of the Republic of China , making it the focus of Japanese bombing . It was one of the last mainland areas to fall to the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and was divided into four parts from 1949 to 1952 , with Chongqing restored two years later . It suffered gravely during the Great Chinese Famine of 1959-61 but remained China 's most populous province until Chongqing Municipality was again separated from it in 1997 . The people of Sichuan speak a unique form of Mandarin , which took shape during the area 's repopulation under the Ming .

Rescue groups from around the world joined local relief workers and the Taiwanese military in digging out survivors , clearing rubble , restoring essential services and distributing food and other aid to the more than 100,000 people made homeless by the quake . The disaster , dubbed the Quake of the Century by the local media , had a profound effect on the economy of the island and the consciousness of the people , and dissatisfaction with government 's performance in reacting to it was said by some commentators to be a factor in the unseating of the ruling Kuomintang party in the 2000 presidential election .",

Neighbouring states include the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) to the north-west , Japan to the north-east , and the Philippines to the south . The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres ( 13,826 sq mi ) , with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third , where its highly urbanised population is concentrated . Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",

It occurred at 11:56 Nepal Standard Time on 25 April 2015 , with a magnitude of 7.8Mw or 8.1Ms and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VIII ( Severe ) . Its epicenter was east of Gorkha District at Barpak , Gorkha , and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately 8.2 km ( 5.1 mi ) . It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal-Bihar earthquake . The ground motion recorded in the capital of Nepal was of low frequency , which , along with its occurrence at an hour where many people in rural areas were working outdoors , decreased the loss of property and human lives . The earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest , killing 21 , making 25 April 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history . The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley , where 250 people were reported missing . Hundreds of thousands of Nepalese were made homeless with entire villages flattened , across many districts of the country . Centuries-old buildings were destroyed at UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Kathmandu Valley , including some at the Kathmandu Durbar Square , the Patan Durbar Square , the Bhaktapur Durbar Square , the Changu Narayan Temple , the Boudhanath stupa and the Swayambhunath Stupa . Geophysicists and other experts had warned for decades that Nepal was vulnerable to a deadly earthquake , particularly because of its geology , urbanization , and architecture . Dharahara , also called Bhimsen Tower , which was a nine-storey and 61.88-metre-tall tower was destroyed . It was a part of the architecture of Kathmandu recognized by UNESCO .",

  "/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake": "The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred on Californias Central Coast on October 17 at 5:04 p.m. local time ( 1989-10-18 00:04 UTC ) . The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park approximately 10 mi ( 16 km ) northeast of Santa Cruz on a section of the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains . With an Mw magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of IX ( Violent ) , the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries . The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake ( to the degree that it was designated a seismic gap ) until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989 . Damage was heavy in Santa Cruz County and less so to the south in Monterey County , but effects extended well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area , both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland . No surface faulting occurred , though many other ground failures and landslides were present , especially in the Summit area of the Santa Cruz Mountains . Liquefaction was also a significant issue , especially in the heavily damaged Marina District of San Francisco , but its effects were also seen in the East Bay , and near the shore of Monterey Bay , where a non-destructive tsunami was also observed . Because it happened during a national live broadcast of the 1989 World Series , taking place between Bay Area teams San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics , it is sometimes referred to as the World Series earthquake . Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was lighter than normal because the game , being played at Candlestick Park in San Francisco , was about to begin , and this may have prevented a larger loss of life , as several of the Bay Area 's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures . The collapse of a section of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland was the site of the largest number of casualties for the event , but the collapse of man-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco , Los Altos , and Santa Cruz .",
