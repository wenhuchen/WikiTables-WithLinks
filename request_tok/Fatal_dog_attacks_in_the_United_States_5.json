  "/wiki/Pit_bull": "Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers . The pit bull-type is particularly ambiguous , as it encompasses a range of pedigree breeds , informal types and appearances that can not be reliably identified . Formal breeds often considered to be of the pit bull-type include the American Pit Bull Terrier , American Staffordshire Terrier , American Bully , and Staffordshire Bull Terrier . The American Bulldog is also sometimes included . Mixed-breed dogs which physically resemble these breeds often get labelled as pit bulls by shelters . Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from crossbreeding bull-baiting dogs ( used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls ) and terriers . After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned , such dogs were used as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs , to hunt and drive livestock , and as family companions . Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States , it still exists as an underground activity , and pit bulls are a common type used . According to the American Veterinary Medical Association , owners of pit bull-type dogs deal with a strong breed stigma ; however , controlled studies have not identified this breed group as disproportionately dangerous . Because owners of stigmatized breeds are more likely to have involvement in criminal or violent acts , breed correlations may have the owner 's behavior as the underlying causal factor . Some jurisdictions have enacted legislation banning the group of breeds , and some insurance companies do not cover liability from pit bull bites . Among other roles , pit bulls have served as police dogs , search and rescue dogs , and several have appeared on film .",

  "/wiki/Taser": "A Taser /\u02c8te\u026az\u0259r/ is a brand of conducted electrical weapon sold by Axon , formerly Taser International . It fires two small barbed darts intended to puncture the skin and remain attached to the target . The darts are connected to the main unit by thin insulated copper wire and deliver a modulated electric current designed to disrupt voluntary control of muscles , causing neuromuscular incapacitation . The effects of a Taser may only be localized pain or strong involuntary long muscle contractions , based on the mode of use and connectivity of the darts . The Taser is marketed as less-lethal since the possibility of serious injury or death exists whenever the weapon is deployed . The Taser was introduced as a less-lethal force option for police to use to subdue fleeing , belligerent , or potentially dangerous people , who would have otherwise been subjected to more lethal force options such as firearms . A 2009 report by the Police Executive Research Forum in the United States found that police officer injuries dropped by 76% in large law enforcement agencies that deployed Tasers in the first decade of the 21st century compared with those that did not use them at all . Taser International and its CEO Rick Smith have claimed that unspecified police surveys show that the device has saved 75,000 lives through 2011 . A more recent academic study suggested police use of conducted electrical weapons in the United States was less risky to police officers than hands-on tactics and showed officer injury rates equal to use of chemical sprays like oleoresin capsicum . However , when police combined conducted electrical weapons with use of other weapons , officers were four or five times more likely to be injured than when using a baton or chemical spray .",

Tranquillizer guns have a long history of use to stun wildlife and criminals when they are in a place where they pose a threat to others and themselves without having to kill the animal or individual , or used to capture wildlife risking serious injuries to both the hunter and the target . They are also used for recreation . Tranquillizer darts can also be fired by crossbow or breath-powered blowgun .",
