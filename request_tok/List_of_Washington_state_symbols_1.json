  "/wiki/Pacific_tree_frog": "The Pacific tree frog ( Pseudacris regilla ) , also known as the Pacific chorus frog , has a range spanning the Pacific Northwest , from Northern California , Oregon , and Washington to British Columbia in Canada and extreme southern Alaska . They live from sea level to more than 10,000 feet in many types of habitats , reproducing in aquatic settings . They occur in shades of greens or browns and can change colors over periods of hours and weeks .",
  "/wiki/Indigenous_(ecology)": "In biogeography , a species is indigenous to a given region or ecosystem if its presence in that region is the result of only natural processes , with no human intervention . The term is equivalent to the concept of native or autochthonous species . Every wild organism ( as opposed to a domesticated organism ) has its own natural range of distribution in which it is regarded as indigenous . Outside this native range , a species may be introduced by human activity , either intentionally or unintentionally ; it is then referred to as an introduced species within the regions where it was anthropogenically introduced . The notion of indigeneity is often a blurred concept , as is a function of both time and political boundaries . Seen over long periods of time , plants and animals take part in the constant movement of tectonic plates - species appear and may flourish , endure , or become extinct , and their distribution is rarely static or confined to a particular geographic location . An indigenous species in a location is not necessarily also endemic to that location . Endemic species are exclusively found in a particular place . An indigenous species may occur in areas other than the one under consideration . The terms endemic and indigenous also do not imply that an organism necessarily first originated or evolved where it is currently found .",
  "/wiki/Pacific_Northwest": "The Pacific Northwest ( PNW ) , sometimes referred to as Cascadia , is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and ( loosely ) by the Rocky Mountains on the east . Though no official boundary exists , the most common conception includes the Canadian province of British Columbia ( BC ) and the U.S. states of Idaho , Oregon , and Washington . Broader conceptions reach north into Southeast Alaska and Yukon , south into northern California , and east to the Continental Divide to include Western Montana and parts of Wyoming . Narrower conceptions may be limited to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains . The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region 's history , culture , geography , society , and other factors . The Northwest Coast is the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest , and the Northwest Plateau ( also commonly known as the Interior in British Columbia and the Inland Northwest in the United States ) is the inland region . The term Pacific Northwest should not be confused with the Northwest Territory ( also known as the Great Northwest , a historical term in the United States ) or the Northwest Territories of Canada . The region 's largest metropolitan areas are Greater Seattle , Washington , with 3.8 million people ; Metro Vancouver , British Columbia , with 2.5 million people ; and Greater Portland , Oregon , with 2.4 million people . The culture of the Pacific Northwest is influenced by the Canada-United States border , which the United States and the United Kingdom established at a time when the region 's inhabitants were composed mostly of indigenous peoples . Two sections of the border - one along the 49th parallel south of British Columbia and one between the Alaska Panhandle and northern British Columbia - have left a great impact on the region . According to Canadian historian Ken Coates , the border has not merely influenced the Pacific Northwest - rather , the region 's history and character have been determined by the boundary .",
  "/wiki/Cascade_Range": "The Cascade Range or Cascades is a major mountain range of western North America , extending from southern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon to Northern California . It includes both non-volcanic mountains , such as the North Cascades , and the notable volcanoes known as the High Cascades . The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the Canadian Cascades or , locally , as the Cascade Mountains . The latter term is also sometimes used by Washington residents to refer to the Washington section of the Cascades in addition to North Cascades , the more usual U.S. term , as in North Cascades National Park . The highest peak in the range is Mount Rainier in Washington at 14,411 feet ( 4,392 m ) . The Cascades are part of the Pacific Ocean 's Ring of Fire , the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean . All of the eruptions in the contiguous United States over the last 200 years have been from Cascade volcanoes . The two most recent were Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 . Minor eruptions of Mount St. Helens have also occurred since , most recently from 2004 to 2008 . The Cascade Range is a part of the American Cordillera , a nearly continuous chain of mountain ranges ( cordillera ) that form the western backbone of North America , Central America , and South America .",
  "/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Washington": "There are 39 counties in the U.S. state of Washington . The Provisional Government of Oregon established Vancouver and Lewis Counties in 1845 in unorganized Oregon Country , extending from the Columbia River north to 54\u00b040\u2032 North latitude . After the region was organized within the Oregon Territory with the current northern border of 49\u00b0N , Vancouver County was renamed Clarke , and six more counties were created out of Lewis County before the organization of Washington Territory in 1853 ; 28 were formed during Washington 's territorial period , two of which only existed briefly . The final five were established in the 22 years after Washington was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889 . Article XI of the Washington State Constitution addresses the organization of counties . New counties must have a population of at least 2,000 and no county can be reduced to a population below 4,000 due to partitioning to create a new county . To alter the area of a county , the state constitution requires a petition of the majority of the voters in that area . A number of county partition proposals in the 1990s interpreted this as a majority of people who voted , until a 1998 ruling by the Washington Supreme Court clarified that they would need a majority of registered voters . No changes to counties have been made since the formation of Pend Oreille County in 1911 , except when the small area of Cliffdell was moved from Kittitas to Yakima County . The default form of county government is the non-charter commission , with three to five elected commissioners serving as both the legislature and executive . Seven counties have adopted charters providing for home rule distinct from state law : King , Clallam , Whatcom , Snohomish , Pierce , San Juan , and Clark . Of these , King , Whatcom , Snohomish , and Pierce , four major counties on Puget Sound , elect a county executive .",

The list also contains U.S. territory birds as designated by each territory 's legislature . The selection of state birds began in 1927 , when the legislatures for Alabama , Florida , Maine , Missouri , Oregon , Texas and Wyoming selected their state birds . The last state to choose its bird was Arizona in 1973 . Alaska , California , and South Dakota permit hunting of their state birds . Pennsylvania has adopted a state game bird but not a state bird , while Alabama , Georgia , Massachusetts , Missouri , Oklahoma , South Carolina , and Tennessee have designated an additional state game bird for the purpose of hunting . The northern cardinal is the state bird of seven states , followed by the western meadowlark as the state bird of six states . Several states have extinct official animals , such as state dinosaurs in addition to state insects , state butterflies , state mammals and state reptiles .

  "/wiki/American_goldfinch": "The American goldfinch ( Spinus tristis ) is a small North American bird in the finch family . It is migratory , ranging from mid-Alberta to North Carolina during the breeding season , and from just south of the Canada-United States border to Mexico during the winter . The only finch in its subfamily to undergo a complete molt , the American goldfinch displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration ; the male is a vibrant yellow in the summer and an olive color during the winter , while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer . The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate . The American goldfinch is a granivore and adapted for the consumption of seedheads , with a conical beak to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding . This Finch has also been known to eat garden vegetation , and is particularly fond of beet greens . It is a social bird , and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating . It may behave territorially during nest construction , but this aggression is short-lived . Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply , beginning in late July , which is relatively late in the year for a finch . This species is generally monogamous , and produces one brood each year . Human activity has generally benefited the American goldfinch . It is often found in residential areas , attracted to bird feeders which increase its survival rate in these areas .",

The Thraupidae are the second-largest family of birds and represent about 4% of all avian species and 12% of the Neotropical birds . Traditionally , about 240 species of tanagers have been described , but the taxonomic treatment of this family 's members is currently in a state of flux . As more of these birds are studied using modern molecular techniques , some genera are expected to be relocated elsewhere . Already , species in the genera Euphonia and Chlorophonia , which were once considered part of the tanager family , are now treated as members of the Fringillidae , in their own subfamily ( Euphoniinae ) . Likewise , the genera Piranga ( which includes the scarlet tanager , summer tanager , and western tanager ) , Chlorothraupis , and Habia appear to be members of the cardinal family , and have been reassigned to that family by the American Ornithological Society .",

Despite having a name that appears to derive from the Spanish term for the plant genus Juncus ( rushes ) , these birds are seldom found among rush plants , as these prefer wet ground , while juncos like dry soil . Their breeding habitat is coniferous or mixed forest areas throughout North America , ranging from subarctic taiga to high-altitude mountain forests in Mexico and Central America south to Panama . Northern birds usually migrate farther south ; southern populations are permanent residents or altitudinal migrants , moving only a short distance downslope to avoid severe winter weather in the mountains .

The closest relatives of this species are the hoary marmot and the Vancouver Island marmot . In 2009 , it was declared the official endemic mammal of Washington . This marmot is about the size of a domestic cat , typically weighing about 8 kg ( 18 lb ) in summer . The species shows the greatest sexual dimorphism found in marmots , with adult males weighing on average 23% more than females . It can be identified by a wide head , small eyes and ears , stubby legs , and a long , bushy tail . Its sharp , rounded claws aid in digging burrows . The coat color changes with the season and with age , but an adult marmot 's coat is brown all over with small whiter areas for most of the year . The species has a diet consisting mainly of a variety of meadow flora , including dry grasses , which it also uses as bedding in burrows .

In some languages , and occasionally in English , the right to vote is called active suffrage , as distinct from passive suffrage , which is the right to stand for election . The combination of active and passive suffrage is sometimes called full suffrage . Suffrage is often conceived in terms of elections for representatives . However , suffrage applies equally to referenda and initiatives . Suffrage describes not only the legal right to vote , but also the practical question of whether a question will be put to a vote . The utility of suffrage is reduced when important questions are decided unilaterally without extensive , conscientious , full disclosure and public review . In most democracies , eligible voters can vote in elections of representatives . Voting on issues by referendum may also be available . For example , in Switzerland this is permitted at all levels of government . In the United States , some states such as California and Washington have exercised their shared sovereignty to offer citizens the opportunity to write , propose , and vote on referendums and initiatives ; other states and the federal government have not .

The centerpiece of the Fair , the large water pool , represented the long voyage Columbus took to the New World . Chicago had won the right to host the fair over several other cities , including New York City , Washington , D.C. , and St. Louis . The Exposition was an influential social and cultural event and had a profound effect on architecture , sanitation , the arts , Chicago 's self-image , and American industrial optimism . The layout of the Chicago Columbian Exposition was , in large part , designed by John Wellborn Root , Daniel Burnham , Frederick Law Olmsted and Charles B. Atwood . It was the prototype of what Burnham and his colleagues thought a city should be . It was designed to follow Beaux Arts principles of design , namely French neoclassical architecture principles based on symmetry , balance , and splendor . The color of the material generally used to cover the buildings fa\u00e7ades gave the fairgrounds its nickname , the White City . Many prominent architects designed its 14 great buildings . Artists and musicians were featured in exhibits and many also made depictions and works of art inspired by the exposition . The exposition covered 690 acres ( 2.8 km2 ) , featuring nearly 200 new ( but deliberately temporary ) buildings of predominantly neoclassical architecture , canals and lagoons , and people and cultures from 46 countries .

  "/wiki/Killer_whale": "The killer whale or orca ( Orcinus orca ) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family , of which it is the largest member . Killer whales have a diverse diet , although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey . Some feed exclusively on fish , while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin . They have been known to attack baleen whale calves , and even adult whales . Killer whales are apex predators , as no animal preys on them . A cosmopolitan species , they can be found in each of the world 's oceans in a variety of marine environments , from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas , absent only from the Baltic and Black seas , and some areas of the Arctic Ocean . Killer whales are highly social ; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups ( pods ) which are the most stable of any animal species . Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours , which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations , have been described as manifestations of animal culture . The International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses the orca 's conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species . Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion , habitat loss , pollution ( by PCBs ) , capture for marine mammal parks , and conflicts with human fisheries . In late 2005 , the southern resident killer whales , which swim in British Columbia and Washington state waters , were placed on the U.S . Endangered Species list .",

  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",
  "/wiki/Animal_migration": "Animal migration is the relatively long-distance movement of individual animals , usually on a seasonal basis . It is the most common form of migration in ecology . It is found in all major animal groups , including birds , mammals , fish , reptiles , amphibians , insects , and crustaceans . The trigger for the migration may be local climate , local availability of food , the season of the year or for mating reasons . To be counted as a true migration , and not just a local dispersal or irruption , the movement of the animals should be an annual or seasonal occurrence , such as Northern Hemisphere birds migrating south for the winter ; wildebeest migrating annually for seasonal grazing ; or a major habitat change as part of their life , such as young Atlantic salmon or Sea lamprey leaving the river of their birth when they have reached a few inches in size .",
  "/wiki/Puget_Sound": "Puget Sound /\u02c8pju\u02d0d\u0292\u026at/ is a sound of the Pacific Northwest , an inlet of the Pacific Ocean , and part of the Salish Sea . It is located along the northwestern coast of the U.S. state of Washington . It is a complex estuarine system of interconnected marine waterways and basins , with one major and two minor connections to the open Pacific Ocean via the Strait of Juan de Fuca - Admiralty Inlet being the major connection and Deception Pass and Swinomish Channel being the minor . Water flow through Deception Pass is approximately equal to 2% of the total tidal exchange between Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca . Puget Sound extends approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Deception Pass in the north to Olympia , Washington in the south . Its average depth is 450 feet ( 140 m ) and its maximum depth , off Jefferson Point between Indianola and Kingston , is 930 feet ( 280 m ) . The depth of the main basin , between the southern tip of Whidbey Island and Tacoma , Washington , is approximately 600 feet ( 180 m ) . In 2009 , the term Salish Sea was established by the United States Board on Geographic Names as the collective waters of Puget Sound , the Strait of Juan de Fuca , and the Strait of Georgia . Sometimes the terms Puget Sound and Puget Sound and adjacent waters are used for not only Puget Sound proper but also for waters to the north , such as Bellingham Bay and the San Juan Islands region . The term Puget Sound is used not just for the body of water but also the Puget Sound region centered on the sound . Major cities on the sound include Seattle , Tacoma , Olympia , and Everett , Washington . Puget Sound is also the third-largest estuary in the United States , after the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia , and San Francisco Bay in northern California .",
  "/wiki/Oyster": "Oyster is the common name for a number of different families of salt-water bivalve molluscs that live in marine or brackish habitats . In some species , the valves are highly calcified , and many are somewhat irregular in shape . Many , but not all , oysters are in the superfamily Ostreoidea . Some types of oysters are commonly consumed cooked or raw , and in some locales are regarded as a delicacy . Some types of pearl oysters are harvested for the pearl produced within the mantle .

  "/wiki/Ostrea_lurida": "Ostrea lurida , common name the Olympia oyster , after Olympia , Washington in the Puget Sound area , is a species of edible oyster , a marine bivalve mollusk in the family Ostreidae . This species occurs on the northern Pacific coast of North America . Over the years the role of this edible species of oyster has been partly displaced by the cultivation of non-native edible oyster species . Ostrea lurida is now known to be separate from a similar-appearing species , Ostrea conchaphila , which occurs further south , south of Baja California , in Mexico . Molecular evidence has recently confirmed the separate status of the two species . However , previously , for a period of time , Ostrea lurida was considered to be merely a junior synonym of Ostrea conchaphila . O. lurida been found in archaeological excavations along the Central California coast of the Pacific Ocean , demonstrating that it was a marine species exploited by the Native American Chumash people . Also found during excavations are large mounds also known as middens consisting of discarded oyster shells which have been estimated to be at least 3000 years in age .",

  "/wiki/Corsica": "Corsica ( /\u02c8k\u0254\u02d0rs\u026ak\u0259/ ; French : Corse [ k\u0254\u0281s ] ; Corsica in Corsican and Italian , pronounced [ \u02c8korsiga ] and [ \u02c8k\u0254rsika ] respectively ) is an island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 18 regions of France . It is located southeast of the French mainland and west of the Italian Peninsula , with the nearest land mass being the Italian island of Sardinia to the immediate south . A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island . The island is an administrative region of France ( with the regional capital being Ajaccio ) , divided in two administrative departments , Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud . The corresponding regional and departmental territorial collectivities , however , merged on 1 January 2018 , forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica . As a single territorial collectivity , Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regional collectivities ; for example , the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers . Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second largest town in Corsica . After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , in 1755 Corsica became a self-proclaimed Italian-speaking Republic , until it was officially ceded by Genoa to Louis XV as part of a pledge for debts and subsequently annexed to France in 1769 . Napoleon Bonaparte was born the same year in Ajaccio , and his ancestral home ( Maison Bonaparte ) is today a significant visitor attraction and museum . Due to Corsica 's historical ties with the Italian peninsula , the island retains many Italian cultural elements , and the native tongue is recognized as a regional language by the French government .",
