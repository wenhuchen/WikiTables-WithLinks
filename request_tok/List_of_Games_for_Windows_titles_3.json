  "/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum": "Batman : Arkham Asylum is a 2009 action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Eidos Interactive in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment . Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman and written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini , Arkham Asylum was inspired by the long-running comic book mythos . In the game 's main storyline , Batman battles his archenemy , the Joker , who instigates an elaborate plot to seize control of Arkham Asylum , trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes , and threaten the fictional Gotham City with hidden bombs . Most of the game 's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe ; Kevin Conroy , Mark Hamill , and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman , the Joker , and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively . The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman 's combat and stealth abilities , detective skills , and gadgets that can be used in combat and exploration . Batman can freely move around the Arkham Asylum facility , interacting with characters and undertaking missions , and unlocking new areas by progressing through the main story or obtaining new equipment . The player is able to complete side missions away from the main story to unlock additional content and collectible items . Combat focuses on chaining attacks together against numerous foes while avoiding damage , while stealth allows Batman to conceal himself around an area , using gadgets and the environment to silently eliminate enemies . Development began at Rocksteady Studios in May 2007 , with a 40-person team that expanded to 60 people by the project 's conclusion after approximately 21 months . Among others , the game design was inspired by Batman-penned works of Neal Adams and Frank Miller , and Grant Morrison 's Arkham Asylum : A Serious House on Serious Earth graphic novel . Built on Unreal Engine 3 , Arkham Asylum 's production underwent several variations , refining both gameplay such as the combat system , and the central story , resulting in the removal of plot elements and some of Batman 's main enemies , who did not fit the tone of the rest of the game . Rocksteady began developing ideas for a sequel months before Arkham Asylum 's completion , hiding hints to the sequel within the game .",

It currently serves as the publishing business for its parent company , Activision Blizzard , and consists of several subsidiary studios . Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016 . The company was founded as Activision , Inc. in October 1979 in Sunnyvale , California , by former Atari game developers , upset at how they were treated at Atari , to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console . Activision was the first independent , third-party , console video game developer . The 1983 video game crash , in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision 's footsteps without the expertise of Activision 's founders , hurt Activision 's position in console games , forcing them to diversify into games for home computers , including the acquisition of Infocom . After a management shift , with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis , the company renamed itself as Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications . Mediagenic quickly fell into debt , and the company was bought for around US $ 500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991 . Kotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts : dismissing most of its staff , moving the company to Los Angeles , and reverting to the Activision name . Building on existing assets , the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and , after recovering from the former debt , started acquiring numerous studios and intellectual properties over the 1990s and 2000s , among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series . A holding company was formed as Activision 's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios . In 2008 , this holding merged with Vivendi Games ( the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment ) and formed Activision Blizzard , with Kotick as its CEO .",
