  "/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_of_Canada": "The New Democratic Party ( NDP ; French : Nouveau Parti d\u00e9mocratique , NPD ) is a social-democratic federal political party in Canada . The party was founded in 1961 out of the merger of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) with the Canadian Labour Congress ( CLC ) . On the Canadian political spectrum , the party sits to the left of the Liberal Party . Since 2017 , the NDP has been led by Jagmeet Singh , who is the first Indo-Canadian to lead a major federal party in Canada . The federal and provincial ( or territorial ) level NDPs are more integrated than other political parties in Canada , and have shared membership ( except for the New Democratic Party of Quebec ) . Often the third- or fourth-largest party in Canada 's House of Commons , the NDP has never been in power at the federal level , but it has attained second-largest party status once . In the 2011 election under the leadership of Jack Layton , the NDP won the second most seats in the House , gaining the position of Official Opposition for the first time in the party 's history . The NDP subsequently lost 59 seats in the 2015 federal election and fell to third place in Parliament , though it was their second-best seat count to date . Following the 2019 election , the NDP held the balance of power as the Liberals won a minority government , although the party lost 15 seats and fell to fourth place behind the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois .",

  "/wiki/Burnaby\u2014Seymour": "Burnaby - Seymour was a federal electoral district in the province of British Columbia , Canada , that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1968 to 1979 . This riding was created in 1966 from parts of Burnaby - Coquitlam , Burnaby - Richmond and Coast - Capilano ridings . The riding originally consisted of the eastern part of North Vancouver plus areas of Burnaby north of the Grandview Highway and Edmonds Avenue , west of Sperling and north of Pandora Street . That is , North Vancouver east of Lynn Creek plus the Burnaby Heights , Capitol Hill , Brentwood and Deer Lake neighbourhoods of Burnaby . The riding 's first election in 1968 , is notable for being a showdown between the former leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party , Ray Perrault , and federal New Democratic Party leader Tommy Douglas . Given that the North Shore portions of the riding were largely affluent and upper middle class in character and normally a Liberal bastion , Douglas ' strong showing is not so surprising given the working-class and labour background of much of even the better-off parts of the riding in Burnaby . When this riding was redistributed in 1976 , the resulting Burnaby riding consistently returned NDP candidates - this was Svend Robinson 's longtime seat . North Vancouver - Burnaby returned a Progressive Conservative member ( Chuck Cook ) since its creation until it was abolished in 1987 , as did its successor riding , the seat of North Vancouver until Reform Party member Ted White took over the seat on Cook 's retirement . In provincial politics , the equivalent area of North Vancouver was among the last holdouts of the provincial Liberal Party prior to it losing its support base to the Social Credit Party in the early 1980s . Jim Nielsen , who first unsuccessfully ran for the Progressive Conservative Party in Burnaby - Seymour in 1974 was subsequently elected in the 1975 provincial election as the MLA for Richmond .
