  "/wiki/Guant\u00e1namo_Bay": "Guant\u00e1namo Bay ( Spanish : Bah\u00eda de Guant\u00e1namo ) is a bay located in Guant\u00e1namo Province at the southeastern end of Cuba . It is the largest harbor on the south side of the island and it is surrounded by steep hills which create an enclave that is cut off from its immediate hinterland . The United States assumed territorial control over the southern portion of Guant\u00e1namo Bay under the 1903 Lease agreement . The United States exercises jurisdiction and control over this territory , while recognizing that Cuba retains ultimate sovereignty . The current government of Cuba regards the U.S. presence in Guant\u00e1namo Bay as illegal and insists the Cuban-American Treaty was obtained by threat of force and is in violation of international law . Some legal scholars judge that the lease may be voidable . It is the home of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp located within the base , which are both governed by the United States . Since the 1959 revolution , Cuba has only cashed a single lease payment from the United States government .",
  "/wiki/Cuba": "Cuba ( /\u02c8kju\u02d0b\u0259/ ( listen ) ; Spanish pronunciation : [ \u02c8ku\u03b2a ] ) , officially the Republic of Cuba ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica de Cuba ( help\u00b7info ) ) , is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos . Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . Havana is the largest city and capital ; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey . The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

In 1933 , he became involved in a controversy known as the Business Plot , when he told a congressional committee that a group of wealthy industrialists were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt , with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator , similar to Fascist regimes at that time . The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations , but a final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler 's testimony . In 1935 , Butler wrote a book titled War Is a Racket , where he described and criticized the workings of the United States in its foreign actions and wars , such as those in which he had been involved , including the American corporations and other imperialist motivations behind them .
