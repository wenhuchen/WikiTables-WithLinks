It is designated as part of the A40 , a major road between London and Fishguard , though it is not signed as such , and traffic is regularly restricted to buses and taxis . The road was originally part of the Via Trinobantina , a Roman road between Essex and Hampshire via London . It was known as Tyburn Road through the Middle Ages when it was notorious for public hangings of prisoners at Tyburn Gallows . It became known as Oxford Road and then Oxford Street in the 18th century , and began to change from residential to commercial and retail use by the late 19th century , attracting street traders , confidence tricksters and prostitution . The first department stores in the UK opened in the early 20th century , including Selfridges , John Lewis & Partners and HMV . Unlike nearby shopping streets such as Bond Street , it has retained an element of downmarket trading alongside more prestigious retail stores . The street suffered heavy bombing during World War II , and several longstanding stores including John Lewis were completely destroyed and rebuilt from scratch . Despite competition from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross Shopping Centre , Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location , with several chains having their flagship stores on the street , and has a number of listed buildings . The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959 .

It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building . Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions , the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881 . In 1973 , the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum , but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997 .
