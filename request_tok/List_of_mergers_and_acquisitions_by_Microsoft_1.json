  "/wiki/USD": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",

Since October 2018 , it is also the parent company of mass media pan-European company Sky , making it the biggest and leading media company with more than 53 million subscribers over five countries across Europe . Comcast has been criticized for multiple reasons ; its customer satisfaction often ranks among the lowest in the cable industry . In addition , Comcast has violated net neutrality practices in the past , and , despite Comcast 's commitment to a narrow definition of net neutrality , critics advocate a definition which precludes any distinction between Comcast 's private network services and the rest of the Internet . Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast 's service area ; there is limited competition among cable providers . Furthermore , given Comcast 's negotiating power as a large ISP , some suspect that Comcast could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds . Its ownership of both content production ( in NBCUniversal ) and content distribution ( as an ISP ) has raised antitrust concerns .",
