  "/wiki/Oliver_Hazard_Perry_class_frigate": "The Oliver Hazard Perry class is a class of guided missile frigates named after the U.S. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry , the hero of the naval Battle of Lake Erie . Also known as the Perry or FFG-7 ( commonly fig seven ) class , the warships were designed in the United States in the mid-1970s as general-purpose escort vessels inexpensive enough to be bought in large numbers to replace World War II-era destroyers and complement 1960s-era Knox-class frigates . In Admiral Elmo Zumwalt 's high low fleet plan , the FFG-7s were the low capability ships with the Spruance-class destroyers serving as the high capability ships . Intended to protect amphibious landing forces , supply and replenishment groups , and merchant convoys from aircraft and submarines , they were also later part of battleship-centred surface action groups and aircraft carrier battle groups/strike groups . Fifty-five ships were built in the United States : 51 for the United States Navy and four for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . In addition , eight were built in Taiwan , six in Spain , and two in Australia for their navies . Former U.S. Navy warships of this class have been sold or donated to the navies of Bahrain , Egypt , Poland , Pakistan , Taiwan , and Turkey . The first of the 51 U.S. Navy built Oliver Hazard Perry frigates entered into service in 1977 , and the last remaining in active service , USS Simpson , was decommissioned on 29 September 2015 . The retired vessels were either mothballed or transferred to other navies for continued service . Some of the U.S. Navy 's frigates , such as USS Duncan ( 14.6 years in service ) had fairly short careers , while a few lasted as long as 30+ years in active U.S. service , with some lasting even longer after being sold or donated to other navies .",

The sovereign constitutional monarchy is a federation of seven emirates consisting of Abu Dhabi ( which serves as the capital ) , Ajman , Dubai , Fujairah , Ras Al Khaimah , Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain . Their boundaries are complex , with numerous enclaves within the various emirates . Each emirate is governed by a ruler ; together , they jointly form the Federal Supreme Council . One of the rulers serves as the President of the United Arab Emirates . In 2013 , the UAE 's population was 9.2 million , of which 1.4 million are Emirati citizens and 7.8 million are expatriates . Human occupation of the present UAE has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 125,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-1 site in Mleiha , Sharjah . Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area .",
