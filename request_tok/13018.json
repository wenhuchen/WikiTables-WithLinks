It acts as a natural breakwater , protecting the former grain port of Port Victoria and providing a sheltered anchorage . After European colonisation it was used used for the grazing of sheep , for rabbit disease research , was quarried for lime to supply the lead smelter at Port Pirie and is currently leased to the island 's traditional owners : the Narungga .

  "/wiki/SS_Admella": "SS Admella was an Australian passenger steamship that was shipwrecked on a submerged reef off the coast of Carpenter Rocks , south west of Mount Gambier South Australia , in the early hours of Saturday 6 August 1859 . Survivors clung to the wreck for over a week and many people took days to die as they glimpsed the land from the sea and watched as one rescue attempt after another failed . With the loss of 89 lives , mostly due to cold and exposure , it is one of the worst maritime disasters in Australian history . Admella disaster remains the greatest loss of life in the history of European settlement in South Australia . Of the 113 on board 24 survived , including only one woman , Bridget Ledwith . Of the 89 dead , 14 were children . The 150th anniversary of the disaster was marked in August 2009 by events across the south east of South Australia and at Portland , Victoria .",
  "/wiki/Passenger_ship": "A passenger ship is a merchant ship whose primary function is to carry passengers on the sea . The category does not include cargo vessels which have accommodations for limited numbers of passengers , such as the ubiquitous twelve-passenger freighters once common on the seas in which the transport of passengers is secondary to the carriage of freight . The type does however include many classes of ships designed to transport substantial numbers of passengers as well as freight . Indeed , until recently virtually all ocean liners were able to transport mail , package freight and express , and other cargo in addition to passenger luggage , and were equipped with cargo holds and derricks , kingposts , or other cargo-handling gear for that purpose . Only in more recent ocean liners and in virtually all cruise ships has this cargo capacity been eliminated . While typically passenger ships are part of the merchant marine , passenger ships have also been used as troopships and often are commissioned as naval ships when used as for that purpose .",

  "/wiki/Ketch": "A ketch is a two-masted sailboat whose mainmast is taller than the mizzen mast ( or aft-mast ) , generally in a 40-foot or bigger boat . The name ketch is derived from catch . The ketch 's main mast is usually stepped in the same position as in a sloop . Its sail-plan is similar to that of a yawl , on which the mizzen mast is smaller and set further back . The addition of headsails can makes a cutter-ketch . In New England , in the 1600s the ketch was a small coastal craft . In the 1700s it disappeared from contemporary records , apparently replaced by the schooner . A ketch rig has an advantage over a sloop downwind , and in heavy winds where it has more variety of setups than a sloop , but is less efficient than a sloop upwind . Staysails can also be hoisted between the top of the mizzen mast and base of the main mast to help downwind performance , and in heavy winds the mainsail can be dropped altogether leaving the boat stable under foresail and mizzen alone . Dropping the mainsail and operating under mizzen and foresail or even mizzen alone , leaves the central area of the boat free for working without intrusion of the mainsail boom .",
  "/wiki/Brig": "A brig is a sailing vessel with two square-rigged masts . During the Age of Sail , brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels . They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries . Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind . Their rigging differs from that of a brigantine which has a gaff-rigged mainsail , while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail .",

Such a ship was also known as an iron screw steam ship . In the 19th century , this designation was normally used in contradistinction to the paddle steamer , a still earlier form of steamship that was largely , but not entirely , superseded by the screw steamer . Many famous ships were screw steamers , including the RMS Titanic and RMS Lusitania . These massive leviathans had three or four propellers . Ships under two hundred meters in length usually only had two or one propellers .",

  "/wiki/Fishing_trawler": "A fishing trawler is a commercial fishing vessel designed to operate fishing trawls . Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers . Trawls are fishing nets that are pulled along the bottom of the sea or in midwater at a specified depth . A trawler may also operate two or more trawl nets simultaneously ( double-rig and multi-rig ) . There are many variants of trawling gear . They vary according to local traditions , bottom conditions , and how large and powerful the trawling boats are . A trawling boat can be a small open boat with only 30 horsepower or a large factory ship with 10,000 horsepower . Trawl variants include beam trawls , large-opening midwater trawls , and large bottom trawls , such as rock hoppers that are rigged with heavy rubber wheels that let the net crawl over rocky bottom .",

It was shortly afterwards ( after his meeting with Flinders at Encounter Bay on 8 April 1802 ) mapped by Nicolas Baudin , who named it Golfe de la Mauvaise or Golfe de la Misanthrophie . In the following year Louis de Freycinet renamed it Golphe Josephine to honour Josephine Bonaparte . Due to Flinders ' lengthy imprisonment on Mauritius during his return to England , the publication of Baudin 's map preceded that of Flinders by three years .

  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship , often referred to as a steamer , is a type of steam-powered vessel , typically ocean-faring and seaworthy , that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move ( turn ) propellers or paddlewheels . The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s ; however , there were exceptions that came before . Steamships usually use the prefix designations of PS for paddle steamer or SS for screw steamer ( using a propeller or screw ) . As paddle steamers became less common , SS is assumed by many to stand for steamship . Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as MV for motor vessel , so it is not correct to use SS for most modern vessels . As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns , new trade routes opened up . The steamship has been described as a major driver of the first wave of trade globalization ( 1870-1913 ) and contributor to an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history .",

  "/wiki/Clipper": "A clipper was a type of mid-19th-century merchant sailing ship , designed for speed . Developed from a type of schooner known as Baltimore clippers , clipper ships had three masts and a square rig . They were generally narrow for their length , small by later 19th century standards , could carry limited bulk freight , and had a large total sail area . Clipper ships were mostly constructed in British and American shipyards , though France , Brazil , the Netherlands and other nations also produced some . Clippers sailed all over the world , primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and China , in transatlantic trade , and on the New York-to-San Francisco route around Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush . Dutch clippers were built beginning in the 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to Java . [ citation needed ] The boom years of the clipper ship era began in 1843 as a result of a growing demand for a more rapid delivery of tea from China . It continued under the stimulating influence of the discovery of gold in California and Australia in 1848 and 1851 , and ended with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 . While composite clippers continued to be built into the 1870s , the next generation of sailing ships were iron-hulled . The last full-rigged composite passenger clipper ( Torrens ) was launched in 1875 , while iron hulled clippers in the Australian wool trade continued to be built into the 1890s ."
