  "/wiki/Naucalpan,_State_of_Mexico": "Naucalpan , officially Naucalpan de Ju\u00e1rez , is a city and municipality located just northwest of Mexico City in the adjoining State of Mexico . The name Naucalpan comes from Nahuatl and means place of the four neighborhoods or four houses . Ju\u00e1rez was added to the official name in 1874 in honor of Benito Ju\u00e1rez . The history of the area begins with the Tlatilica who settled on the edges of the Hondo River between 1700 and 600 B.C.E. , but it was the Aztecs who gave it its current name when they dominated it from the 15th century until the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire . Naucalpan claims to be the area where Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s rested on the Noche Triste as they fled Tenochtitlan in 1520 , but this is disputed . It is the home of the Virgin of Los Remedios , a small image of the Virgin Mary which is strongly associated with the Conquest and is said to have been left here . Today , the city of Naucalpan is actually larger than the municipality itself , with part of it extending into neighboring Huixquilucan Municipality . It is a major center of industry in Mexico . It is , however , best known as the location of Ciudad Sat\u00e9lite , a development from the 1960s and the site of the Toreo de Cuatro Caminos bullring , which was demolished in the 2010s to build the Toreo Parque Central mixed-use development . The only unurbanized areas of the municipality are the Los Remedios National Park and a number of ejidos , but the lack of housing has put serious pressure on these areas .",
