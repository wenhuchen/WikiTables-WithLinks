  "/wiki/Entomologist": "Entomology ( from Ancient Greek \u1f14\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd ( entomon ) , meaning 'insect ' , and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 ( -logia ) , meaning 'study of ' ) is the scientific study of insects , a branch of zoology . In the past the term insect was vaguer , and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla , such as arachnids , myriapods , earthworms , land snails , and slugs . This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use . Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology , entomology is a taxon-based category ; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is , by definition , entomology . Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics , behavior , biomechanics , biochemistry , systematics , physiology , developmental biology , ecology , morphology , and paleontology . At some 1.3 million described species , insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms , date back some 400 million years , and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth .",

STS-117 also brought Expedition 15 crewmember Clayton Anderson to the station , and returned with ISS crewmember Sunita Williams .

Some focus on porting games from one system to another , or translating games from one language to another . Less commonly , some do software development work in addition to games . Most video game publishers maintain development studios ( such as Electronic Arts 's EA Canada , Square Enix 's studios , Activision 's Radical Entertainment , Nintendo EAD and Sony 's Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog ) . However , since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as publishers rather than developers .
