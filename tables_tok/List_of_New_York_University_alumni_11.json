This partial list of notable New York University alumni includes a sampling of the many graduates who are leaders in their respective fields, non-graduate former students, fictional students, and current students of New York University. The list is abridged - only a representative few are listed. NYU ranks 7th among the World's top 100 universities for producing millionaires, as compiled by Times Higher Education World University Rankings. NYU ranks 5th globally among universities with the highest number of alumni worth $30 million or more, as compiled by ABC News. CNBC ranks NYU 4th globally among universities with the most billionaire graduates. National Academy of Inventors ranks NYU 19th in the world based on the number of patents generated. In 2016, a study based on a computerized analysis of the number of times institutions of higher education are mentioned in Wikipedia and the number of times people search for them on Google, ranked NYU #19 among all universities in the world. NYU also is the second top feeder school for analyst careers in finance and investment banking, after University of Pennsylvania, on Wall Street."
