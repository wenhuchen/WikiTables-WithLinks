  "/wiki/Hubert_Strolz": "Hubert Strolz ( born 26 June 1962 ) , nickname Hubsi , is a former alpine skier from Austria . At the 1988 Olympics in Calgary he won a gold medal in the combined and silver in the Giant Slalom . In the World Cup , he won a combined competition 17 January 1988 , in Bad Kleinkirchheim . This event was a part of the Hahnenkamm-races which were transferred to BKK ( short name ) because there was not enough snow in Kitzb\u00fchel . Hubert was a sober racer and an eternal runner-up by finishing 2nd for 14 times ( and in 18 times he finished as the third , always in regard to the Alpine World Cup ) . He was on the way to win another gold medal in the combined at the 1992 Olympics in Albertville but he fell down in the second leg of the slalom just a short distance before the finish line . Like in that case ( he saw it as compensation for having luck by winning the gold medal in Calgary , when the great favourite Pirmin Zurbriggen did n't finish the slalom in this way too ) , he always did n't interpret losses as an unluck though it seemed so for the public . He did hold the view that his opponents did it better than he ( quite often he was - unexpected - intercepted as a race-leader , and in the FIS Alpine Skiing World Championships 1989 , he was third in the Super-G but at last Toma\u017e \u010ci\u017eman ( 22nd starter ) could obtain the bronze medal .
