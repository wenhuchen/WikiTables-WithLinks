  "/wiki/Terence_Fisher": "Terence Fisher ( 23 February 1904 - 18 June 1980 ) was a British film director best known for his work for Hammer Films . He was the first to bring gothic horror alive in full colour , and the sexual overtones and explicit horror in his films , while mild by modern standards , were unprecedented in his day . His first major gothic horror film was The Curse of Frankenstein ( 1957 ) , which launched Hammer 's association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era . He went on to film several adaptations of classic horror subjects , including Dracula ( 1958 ) , The Mummy ( 1959 ) , and The Curse of the Werewolf ( 1961 ) . Given their subject matter and lurid approach , Fisher 's films , though commercially successful , were largely dismissed by critics during his career . It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an auteur in his own right . His most famous films are characterised by a blend of fairytale myth and the supernatural alongside themes of sexuality , morality , and the charm of evil . Drawing heavily on a Christian conservative outlook , there is often a hero who defeats the powers of darkness by a combination of faith in God and reason , in contrast to other characters , who are either blindly superstitious or bound by cold , godless rationalism . For detailed discussions of Fisher 's work , see Terence Fisher : Horror , Myth , and Religion by Paul Leggett ( McFarland and Co , 2002 ) , British Film Makers : Terence Fisher by Peter Hutchings ( Manchester University Press , 2013 ) , and The Films of Terence Fisher : Hammer Horror and Beyond by Wheeler Winston Dixon ( Auteur Publishing , 2017 ) .",
