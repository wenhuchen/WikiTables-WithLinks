While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects .

In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

The name derives from the city of Weimar , where its constitutional assembly first took place . The official name of the republic remained Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) unchanged from 1871 , because of the German tradition of substates . Although commonly translated as German Empire , the word Reich here better translates as realm , in that the term does not necessarily have monarchical connotations in itself . The Reich was changed from a constitutional monarchy into a republic . In English , the country was usually known simply as Germany . Germany became a de facto republic on 9 November 1918 when Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son Crown Prince Wilhelm , and became a de jure republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created . A national assembly was convened in Weimar , where a new constitution for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919 . In its fourteen years , the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems , including hyperinflation , political extremism ( with contending paramilitaries ) as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War . Resentment in Germany towards the Treaty of Versailles was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty . The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations ( by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan ) . Under the Locarno Treaties , Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning irredentist claims on France and Belgium , but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade Austria to join Germany as one of Germany 's states .",

With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

His mother , Olga Leighton , was an Irish nurse . At age 17 , Portago began displaying his flamboyant lifestyle by winning a $ 500 bet after flying a borrowed plane under London Tower Bridge . He twice rode the Grand National as gentleman rider and formed the first Spanish bobsleigh team with his cousins , finishing 4th in the 1956 Winter Olympics , shaving the bronze medal by 0.14 seconds . In 1953 , he was introduced into the Scuderia Ferrari team , competing at the Carrera Panamericana , 1000 km Buenos Aires and several Grand Prix , including a win and second place at the 1956 Tour de France Automobile and 1956 British Grand Prix respectively . In May 1957 , Portago 's renowned Ferrari 335 S crashed while taking a curve at 150m/h at the Mille Miglia , killing both drivers and 9 spectators . The young age of the Marquess who was 28 at the time of his death combined with his status as a sex symbol caused a shock amongst many , having several tributes and landmarks named after him , most notably the Portago curve at Jarama racetrack . The Marquess of Portago was seen by many as a true playboy of his time ; a tall , handsome and wealthy Spanish aristocrat who captured everybody 's imagination . Gregor Grant famously said of him : a man like Portago appears only once in a generation , and it would probably be more accurate to say only once in a lifetime . The fellow does everything fabulously well .",
