  "/wiki/Bedout": "Bedout /b\u026a\u02c8du\u02d0/ , or more specifically the Bedout High , is a geological and geophysical feature centered about 250 km ( 160 miles ) off the northwestern coast of Australia in the Canning and overlying Roebuck basins . Although not obvious from sea floor topography , it is a roughly circular area about 30 km ( 19 miles ) in diameter where older rocks have been uplifted as much as 4 km ( 2.5 miles ) towards the surface and may mark the centre of a very large buried impact crater up to 250 km ( 160 miles ) in diameter . The Bedout High was penetrated by two petroleum exploration wells ( Bedout-1 , Lagrange-1 ) in the 1970s and 1980s . It is named after nearby Bedout Island .",

It is bounded by Asia to the north , Africa to the west , and Australia to the east . To the south it is bounded by the Southern Ocean or Antarctica , depending on the definition in use .",
  "/wiki/Western_Australia": "Western Australia [ a ] ( abbreviated as WA ) is a state occupying the entire western third of Australia . It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west , and the Southern Ocean to the south , [ b ] the Northern Territory to the north-east , and South Australia to the south-east . Western Australia is Australia 's largest state , with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres ( 976,790 sq mi ) , and the second-largest country subdivision in the world , surpassed only by Russia 's Sakha Republic . The state has about 2.6 million inhabitants - around 11 percent of the national total - of whom the vast majority ( 92 per cent ) live in the south-west corner , 79 per cent of the population living in the Perth area , leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated . The first European visitor to Western Australia was the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog , who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616 . The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829 , including the site of the present-day capital , Perth . York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia . Situated 97 kilometres ( 60 miles ) east of Perth , it was settled on 16 September 1831 . Western Australia achieved responsible government in 1890 and federated with the other British colonies in Australia in 1901 . Today , its economy mainly relies on mining , oil and gas , services and construction .",

  "/wiki/Tasmania": "Tasmania ( /t\u00e6z\u02c8me\u026ani\u0259/ ; abbreviated as TAS , nicknamed Tassie ) is an island state of Australia . It is located 240 km ( 150 mi ) to the south of the Australian mainland , separated by Bass Strait . The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania , the 26th-largest island in the world , and the surrounding 334 islands . The state has a population of around 533,308 as of March 2019 [ update ] . Just over forty percent of the population resides in the Greater Hobart precinct , which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city , Hobart . Tasmania 's area is 68,401 km2 ( 26,410 sq mi ) , of which the main island covers 64,519 km2 ( 24,911 sq mi ) . It is promoted as a natural state , and protected areas of Tasmania cover about 42% of its land area , which includes national parks and World Heritage Sites . Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental political party in the world . The island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30,000 years before British colonisation . It is thought Aboriginal Tasmanians were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait . The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation , but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the Black War , intertribal conflict , and from the late 1820s , the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity . The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers .",
  "/wiki/Diamantina_River_ring_feature": "The zone in which the Winton asteroid impact theoretically happened lies in a sparsely populated area in the Australian Outback centred roughly at 22\u00b009\u2032S 141\u00b054\u2032E / 22.15\u00b0S 141.9\u00b0E / -22.15 ; 141.9 . It is roughly circular and its diameter measures some 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) ( and it thus has an area of about 408 square kilometres ( 158 sq mi ) ) . The depopulated town of Middleton and Dagworth Station - famous for the part it played in the creation of Waltzing Matilda - lie within the anomaly discovered here . Skirting the anomaly zone for more than half its circumference , mostly on the north and east sides , round from its headwaters to well below its confluence with the Western River , is the Diamantina River , an intermittent stream with , in most places , several braided channels of the kind that give the Channel Country its name . It was this particular hooked shape in the upper Diamantina that first raised questions .",

  "/wiki/East_Warburton_Basin": "The East Warburton Basin in South Australia is the site of a hypothesised large impact crater of the Carboniferous period ( around 360-300 million years ago ) . The subterranean structure lies buried at a depth of ~4 km , and measures a minimum of 200 km in diameter . For comparison , the Chicxulub crater is about 180 km in diameter . The East Warburton crater is adjacent to the West Warburton crater , which is also around 200 km in diameter . Combined , they make up the largest known impact zone on Earth , but individually , are smaller than the two biggest known impact craters in the world - the Sudbury crater in Ontario , thought to be caused by comet impact and estimated to have been 250 kilometres across originally ; and the largest in the world , the 300 km wide Vredefort crater in South Africa . The Warburton craters formed when an asteroid or comet , on a collision course with Earth , split into two main pieces and impacted the Australian continent , then part of the Gondwanan supercontinent . Scientists proposed the impact formation through analysis of shocked quartz grains from the area after a circular anomaly appeared in seismic tomography studies of the region .",
  "/wiki/South_Australia": "South Australia ( abbreviated as SA ) is a state in the southern central part of Australia . It covers some of the most arid parts of the country . With a total land area of 983,482 square kilometres ( 379,725 sq mi ) , it is the fourth-largest of Australia 's states and territories by area , and fifth largest by population . It has a total of 1.7 million people , and its population is the second most highly centralised in Australia , after Western Australia , with more than 77 percent of South Australians living in the capital , Adelaide , or its environs . Other population centres in the state are relatively small ; Mount Gambier , the second largest centre , has a population of 28,684 . South Australia shares borders with all of the other mainland states , and with the Northern Territory ; it is bordered to the west by Western Australia , to the north by the Northern Territory , to the north-east by Queensland , to the east by New South Wales , to the south-east by Victoria , and to the south by the Great Australian Bight .

  "/wiki/Massive_Australian_Precambrian/Cambrian_Impact_Structure,MAPCIS": "The Massive Australian Precambrian/Cambrian Impact Structure also known as MAPCIS is a proposed impact structure based upon arguments presented by Daniel P. Connelly , a pharmacist , at Geological Society of America meetings . Its center is located approximately equidistant between Uluru ( Ayers Rock ) and Mount Conner in Australia 's Northern Territory . The structure is approximately 600 km ( 370 mi ) in diameter . However , a hypothetical outermost ring 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) in diameter is claimed to be the result of undefined far field stresses . Connelly argues that the age of this hypothetical impact is approximately 545 mya which puts it just before the Cambrian explosion ( 542 mya ) of the current Phanerozoic eon ( 541 mya ) . If confirmed as an impact structure , it would be the largest on Earth .",
  "/wiki/Northern_Territory": "The Northern Territory ( NT ; formally the Northern Territory of Australia ) is an Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia . It shares borders with Western Australia to the west ( 129th meridian east ) , South Australia to the south ( 26th parallel south ) , and Queensland to the east ( 138th meridian east ) . To the north , the territory looks out to the Timor Sea , the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria , including Western New Guinea and other Indonesian islands . The NT covers 1,349,129 square kilometres ( 520,902 sq mi ) , making it the third-largest Australian federal division , and the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world . It is sparsely populated , with a population of only 245,800 , fewer than half as many people as Tasmania . The archaeological history of the Northern Territory begins over 40,000 years ago when Indigenous Australians settled the region . Makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards . The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century . The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions . After three failed attempts to establish a settlement ( 1824-28 , 1838-49 , and 1864-66 ) , success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin . Today the economy is based on tourism , especially Kakadu National Park in the Top End and the Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park ( Ayers Rock ) in central Australia , and mining . The capital and largest city is Darwin .",
