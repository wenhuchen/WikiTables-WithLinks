  "/wiki/Bacteroides": "Bacteroides is a genus of Gram-negative , obligate anaerobic bacteria . Bacteroides species are non endospore-forming bacilli , and may be either motile or nonmotile , depending on the species . The DNA base composition is 40-48% GC . Unusual in bacterial organisms , Bacteroides membranes contain sphingolipids . They also contain meso-diaminopimelic acid in their peptidoglycan layer . Bacteroides species are normally mutualistic , making up the most substantial portion of the mammalian gastrointestinal microbiota , where they play a fundamental role in processing of complex molecules to simpler ones in the host intestine . As many as 1010-1011 cells per gram of human feces have been reported . They can use simple sugars when available ; however , the main sources of energy for Bacteroides species in the gut are complex host-derived and plant glycans . Studies indicate that long-term diet is strongly associated with the gut microbiome composition - those who eat plenty of protein and animal fats have predominantly Bacteroides bacteria , while for those who consume more carbohydrates the Prevotella species dominate . One of the most important clinically is Bacteroides fragilis . Bacteroides melaninogenicus has recently been reclassified and split into Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella intermedia .",
  "/wiki/Bacteroides_fragilis": "Bacteroides fragilis is an obligately anaerobic , Gram-negative , rod-shaped bacterium . It is part of the normal microbiota of the human colon and is generally commensal , but can cause infection if displaced into the bloodstream or surrounding tissue following surgery , disease , or trauma .",
  "/wiki/Bacteroidetes": "The phylum Bacteroidetes is composed of three large classes of Gram-negative , nonsporeforming , anaerobic or aerobic , and rod-shaped bacteria that are widely distributed in the environment , including in soil , sediments , and sea water , as well as in the guts and on the skin of animals . Although some Bacteroides spp . can be opportunistic pathogens , many Bacteroidetes are symbiotic species highly adjusted to the gastrointestinal tract . Bacteroides are highly abundant in intestines , reaching up to 1011 cells g\u22121 of intestinal material . They perform metabolic conversions that are essential for the host , such as degradation of proteins or complex sugar polymers . Bacteroidetes colonize the gastrointestinal already in infants , as non-digestible oligosaccharides in mother milk support the growth of both Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp . Bacteroides spp. , is selectively recognized by the immune system of the host through specific interactions .",
  "/wiki/Bacteroides_thetaiotaomicron": "Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ( formerly Bacillus thetaiotaomicron ) is a species of bacterium of the genus Bacteroides . It is a gram-negative obligate anaerobe . It is one of the most common bacteria found in human gut flora and is also an opportunistic pathogen . Its genome contains numerous genes apparently specialized in digestion of polysaccharides .",
  "/wiki/Chlorobi": "The green sulfur bacteria ( Chlorobiaceae ) are a family of obligately anaerobic photoautotrophic bacteria . Together with the non-photosynthetic Ignavibacteriaceae , they form the phylum Chlorobi . Green sulfur bacteria are nonmotile ( except Chloroherpeton thalassium , which may glide ) and capable of anoxygenic photosynthesis . In contrast to plants , green sulfur bacteria mainly use sulfide ions as electron donors . They are autotrophs that utilize the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle to perform carbon fixation . Green sulfur bacteria have been found in depths of up to 145m in the Black Sea , with low light availability . Characteristics of green-Sulfur bacteria : Major photosynthetic pigment : Bacteriochlorophylls a plus c , d or e Location of photosynthetic pigment : Chlorosomes and plasma membranes Photosynthetic electron donor : H2 , H2S , S Sulfur deposition : Outside of the cell Metbolic type : Photolithoautotrophs",
  "/wiki/DOE_Joint_Genome_Institute": "The U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) Joint Genome Institute ( JGI ) , first located in Walnut Creek then Berkeley , California , was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping , DNA sequencing , technology development , and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) and Los Alamos National Laboratory ( LANL ) . As a DOE Office of Science User Facility of Berkeley Lab , the JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab , LLNL and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology . The JGI also collaborates with other DOE-supported programs and facilities , such as the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) , the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center , or NERSC , and the DOE Bioenergy Research Centers .",
  "/wiki/Chlorobium": "Chlorobium ( also known as Chlorochromatium ) is a genus of green sulfur bacteria . They are photolithotrophic oxidizers of sulfur and most notably utilise a noncyclic electron transport chain to reduce NAD+ . Photosynthesis is achieved using a Type 1 Reaction Centre using bacteriochlorophyll ( BChl ) a . Two photosynthetic antenna complexes aid in light absorption : the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex ( FMO , also containing BChl a ) , and the chlorosomes which employ mostly BChl c , d , or e. Hydrogen sulfide is used as an electron source and carbon dioxide its carbon source . Chlorobium species exhibit a dark green color ; in a Winogradsky column , the green layer often observed is composed of Chlorobium . This genus lives in strictly anaerobic conditions below the surface of a body of water , commonly the anaerobic zone of a eutrophic lake . Chlorobium aggregatum is a species which exists in a symbiotic relationship with a colorless , nonphotosynthetic bacteria . This species looks like a bundle of green bacteria , attached to a central rod-like cell which can move around with a flagellum . The green , outer bacteria use light to oxidize sulfide into sulfate . The inner cell , which is not able to perform photosynthesis , reduces the sulfate into sulfide . These bacteria divide in unison , giving the structure a multicellular appearance which is highly unusual in bacteria . Chlorobium species are thought to have played an important part in mass extinction events on Earth .",
  "/wiki/Chlorobium_chlorochromatii": "Chlorobium chlorochromatii , originally known as Chlorobium aggregatum , is a symbiotic green sulfur bacteria that performs anoxygenic photosynthesis and functions as an obligate photoautotroph using reduced sulfur species as electron donors . Chlorobium chlorochromatii can be found in stratified freshwater lakes .",

  "/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis": "Porphyromonas gingivalis belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and is a nonmotile , Gram-negative , rod-shaped , anaerobic , pathogenic bacterium . It forms black colonies on blood agar . It is found in the oral cavity , where it is implicated in periodontal disease , as well as in the upper gastrointestinal tract , the respiratory tract and the colon . It has been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis . Collagen degradation observed in chronic periodontal disease results in part from the collagenase enzymes of this species . It has been shown in an in vitro study that P. gingivalis can invade human gingival fibroblasts and can survive in the presence of antibiotics . P. gingivalis invades gingival epithelial cells in high numbers , in which case both bacteria and epithelial cells survive for extended periods of time . High levels of specific antibodies can be detected in patients harboring P. gingivalis . P. gingivalis infection has been linked to Alzheimer 's disease and rheumatoid arthritis . It contains the enzyme peptidyl-arginine deiminase , which is involved in citrullination . Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have increased incidence of periodontal disease ; antibodies against the bacterium are significantly more common in these patients . P. gingivalis is divided into K-serotypes based upon capsular antigenicity of the various types ."
