  "/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)": "Forth is an imperative stack-based computer programming language and environment originally designed by Charles Chuck Moore . Language features include structured programming , reflection ( the ability to examine and modify program structure during execution ) , concatenative programming ( functions are composed with juxtaposition ) and extensibility ( the programmer can create new commands ) . Although not an acronym , the language 's name is sometimes spelled with all capital letters as FORTH , following the customary usage during its earlier years . A procedural programming language without type checking , Forth features both interactive execution of commands ( making it suitable as a shell for systems that lack a more formal operating system ) and the ability to compile sequences of commands for later execution . For much of Forth 's existence , the standard technique was to compile to threaded code , but there are modern implementations that generate optimized machine code like other language compilers . Forth is used in the Open Firmware boot loader , in space applications such as the Philae spacecraft , and other embedded systems which involve interaction with hardware . The bestselling 1986 computer game Starflight , from Electronic Arts , was written with a custom Forth . The free software Gforth implementation is actively maintained , as are several commercially supported systems .",

  "/wiki/POP-2": "POP-2 ( also referred to as POP2 ) is a programming language developed around 1970 from the earlier language POP-1 ( developed by Robin Popplestone in 1968 , originally named COWSEL ) by Robin Popplestone and Rod Burstall at the University of Edinburgh . It drew roots from many sources : the languages LISP and ALGOL 60 , and theoretical ideas from Peter J. Landin . It used an incremental compiler , which gave it some of the flexibility of an interpreted language , including allowing new function definitions at run time and modification of function definitions while a program was running ( both of which are features of dynamic compilation ) , without the overhead of an interpreted language .",

  "/wiki/SAIL_(programming_language)": "SAIL , the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language , was developed by Dan Swinehart and Bob Sproull of the Stanford AI Lab in 1970 . It was originally a large ALGOL 60-like language for the PDP-10 and DECSYSTEM-20 . SAIL 's main feature is a symbolic data system based upon an associative store ( based on the LEAP system of Jerry Feldman and Paul Rovner ) . Items may be stored as unordered sets or as associations ( triples ) . Other features include processes , events and interrupts , contexts , backtracking and record garbage collection . It also has block-structured macros , a coroutining facility and some new data types intended for building search trees and association lists . A number of interesting software systems were coded in SAIL , including some early versions of FTP and TeX , a document formatting system called PUB , and BRIGHT , a clinical database project sponsored by the National Institutes of Health . In 1978 , there were half a dozen different operating systems for the PDP-10 : ITS ( MIT ) , WAITS ( Stanford ) , TOPS-10 ( DEC ) , CMU TOPS-10 ( Carnegie Mellon ) , TENEX ( BBN ) , Tymcom-X ( Tymshare ) , and TOPS-20 ( DEC , based on TENEX ) . SAIL was ported from WAITS to ITS so that MIT researchers could make use of software developed at Stanford University . Every port usually required the rewriting of I/O code in each application . A machine-independent version of SAIL called MAINSAIL was developed in the late 1970s and was used to develop many eCAD design tools during the 1980s . MAINSAIL was easily portable to new processors and operating systems , and was still in limited use as of 2005 [ update ] .",

  "/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)": "Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language , designed by Niklaus Wirth as a small , efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring . It is named in honour of the French mathematician , philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal . Based on Wirth 's book , Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs , Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language . Wirth was involved in the process to improve the language as part of the ALGOL X efforts and proposed a version known as ALGOL W. This was not accepted , and the ALGOL X process bogged down . In 1968 , Wirth decided to abandon the ALGOL X process and further improve ALGOL W , releasing this as Pascal in 1970 . On top of ALGOL 's scalars and arrays , Pascal enabled defining complex datatypes and building dynamic and recursive data structures such as lists , trees and graphs . Pascal has strong typing on all objects , which means that one type of data can not be converted or interpreted as another without explicit conversions . Unlike most languages in the C-family , Pascal allows nested procedure definitions to any level of depth , and also allows most kinds of definitions and declarations inside subroutines ( procedures and functions ) . A program is thus syntactically similar to a single procedure or function . Pascal became very successful in the 1970s , notably on the burgeoning minicomputer market . Compilers were also available for many microcomputers as the field emerged in the late 1970s . It was widely used as a teaching language in university-level programming courses in the 1980s , and also used in production settings for writing commercial software during the same period .",

  "/wiki/BLISS": "BLISS is a system programming language developed at Carnegie Mellon University by W. A. Wulf , D. B. Russell , and A. N. Habermann around 1970 . It was perhaps the best known systems programming language right up until C made its debut a few years later . Since then , C took off and BLISS faded into obscurity . When C was in its infancy , a few projects within Bell Labs were debating the merits of BLISS vs. C [ citation needed ] . BLISS is a typeless block-structured language based on expressions rather than statements , and includes constructs for exception handling , coroutines , and macros . It does not include a goto statement . The name is variously said to be short for Basic Language for Implementation of System Software or System Software Implementation Language , Backwards . It was sometimes called Bill 's Language for Implementing System Software , after Bill Wulf . The original Carnegie Mellon compiler was notable for its extensive use of optimizations , and formed the basis of the classic book The Design of an Optimizing Compiler . DEC developed and maintained BLISS compilers for the PDP-10 , PDP-11 , VAX , DEC Prism , MIPS , DEC Alpha , and Intel IA-32 , The language did not become popular among customers and few had the compiler , but DEC used it heavily in-house into the 1980s ; most of the utility programs for the VMS operating system were written in BLISS-32 . After its acquisition of DEC , Compaq developed and maintained a BLISS compiler for Intel IA-64 .",

Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn , New York founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887 . In 1912 , the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology ( CIT ) and began offering four-year degrees . During this time , CIT consisted of four constituent schools : the School of Fine and Applied Arts , the School of Apprentices and Journeymen , the School of Science and Technology , and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women . The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon ( who went on to become U.S. Treasury Secretary ) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father , Thomas Mellon , patriarch of the Mellon family . The Institute began as a research organization which performed work for government and industry on a contract and was initially established as a department within the University of Pittsburgh . In 1927 , the Mellon Institute incorporated as an independent nonprofit . In 1937 , the Mellon Institute 's iconic building was completed and it moved to its new , and current , location on Fifth Avenue . In 1967 , with support from Paul Mellon , Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University .

  "/wiki/Compiler_Description_Language": "Compiler Description Language , or CDL , is a programming language based on affix grammars . It is very similar to Backus-Naur form ( BNF ) notation . It was designed for the development of compilers . It is very limited in its capabilities and control flow ; and intentionally so . The benefits of these limitations are twofold . On the one hand they make possible the sophisticated data and control flow analysis used by the CDL2 optimizers resulting in extremely efficient code . The other benefit is that they foster a highly verbose naming convention . This in turn leads to programs that are to a great extent self-documenting . The language looks a bit like Prolog ( this is not surprising since both languages arose at about the same time out of work on affix grammars ) . As opposed to Prolog however , control flow in CDL is deterministically based on success/failure i.e. , no other alternatives are tried when the current one succeeds . This idea is also used in parsing expression grammars . CDL3 is the third version of the CDL language , significantly different from the previous two versions .",

  "/wiki/PL/M": "The PL/M programming language ( an acronym of Programming Language for Microcomputers ) is a high-level language conceived and developed by Gary Kildall in 1973 for Hank Smith at Intel for its microprocessors . The language incorporated ideas from PL/I , ALGOL [ citation needed ] and XPL , and had an integrated macro processor . As a graduate of the University of Washington Kildall had used their Burroughs B5500 computer , and as such was aware of the potential of high-level languages such as ESPOL for systems programming . Unlike other contemporary languages such as Pascal , C or BASIC , PL/M had no standard input or output routines . It included features targeted at the low-level hardware specific to the target microprocessors , and as such , it could support direct access to any location in memory , I/O ports and the processor interrupt flags in a very efficient manner . PL/M was the first higher level programming language for microprocessor-based computers and was the original implementation language for those parts of the CP/M operating system which were not written in assembler . Many Intel and Zilog Z80 based embedded systems were programmed in PL/M during the 1970s and 1980s . For instance , the firmware of the Service Processor component of CISC AS/400 was written in PL/M . The original PL/M compiler targeted the Intel 8008 . An updated version ( PL/M-80 ) generated code for the 8080 processor , which would also run on the newer Intel 8085 as well as on the Zilog Z80 family ( as it is backward-compatible with the 8080 ) . Later followed compilers for the Intel 8048 and Intel 8051-microcontroller family ( PL/M-51 ) as well as for the 8086 ( 8088 ) ( PL/M-86 ) , 80186 ( 80188 ) and subsequent 8086-based processors , including the advanced 80286 and the 32-bit 80386 .

Prolog has its roots in first-order logic , a formal logic , and unlike many other programming languages , Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language : the program logic is expressed in terms of relations , represented as facts and rules . A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations . The language was first conceived by Alain Colmerauer and his group in Marseille , France , in the early 1970s and the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel , based on foundational work by Robert Bob A. Kowalski 's procedural interpretation of Horn clauses Prolog was one of the first logic programming languages , and remains the most popular among such languages today , with several free and commercial implementations available . The language has been used for theorem proving , expert systems , term rewriting , type systems , and automated planning , as well as its original intended field of use , natural language processing .

It is particularly useful in handling structured data , i.e . data incorporating relations among entities and variables . SQL offers two main advantages over older read-write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM . Firstly , it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command . Secondly , it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record , e.g . with or without an index . Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus , SQL consists of many types of statements , which may be informally classed as sublanguages , commonly : a data query language ( DQL ) , [ a ] a data definition language ( DDL ) , [ b ] a data control language ( DCL ) , and a data manipulation language ( DML ) .

  "/wiki/ML_(programming_language)": "ML ( Meta Language ) is a general-purpose functional programming language . It has roots in Lisp , and has been characterized as Lisp with types . [ citation needed ] ML is a statically-scoped functional programming language like Scheme . It is known for its use of the polymorphic Hindley-Milner type system , which automatically assigns the types of most expressions without requiring explicit type annotations , and ensures type safety - there is a formal proof that a well-typed ML program does not cause runtime type errors . ML provides pattern matching for function arguments , garbage collection , imperative programming , call-by-value and currying . It is used heavily in programming language research and is one of the few languages to be completely specified and verified using formal semantics . Its types and pattern matching make it well-suited and commonly used to operate on other formal languages , such as in compiler writing , automated theorem proving , and formal verification .",

  "/wiki/LIS_(programming_language)": "LIS ( Language d'Implementation de Syst\u00e8mes ) was a system implementation programming language designed by Jean Ichbiah , who later designed Ada . LIS was used to implement the compiler for the Ada-0 subset of Ada at Karlsruhe on the BS2000 Siemens operating system . Later on the Karlsruhe Ada compilation system got rewritten in Ada-0 itself , which was easy , because LIS and Ada-0 are very close .",
  "/wiki/Jean_Ichbiah": "Jean David Ichbiah ( 25 March 1940 - 26 January 2007 ) was a French computer scientist and the initial chief designer ( 1977-1983 ) of Ada , a general-purpose , strongly typed programming language with certified validated compilers .",
  "/wiki/Groupe_Bull": "Bull SAS ( also known as Groupe Bull , Bull Information Systems , or simply Bull ) is a French-owned computer company headquartered in Les Clayes-sous-Bois , in the western suburbs of Paris . The company has also been known at various times as Bull General Electric , Honeywell Bull , CII Honeywell Bull , and Bull HN . Bull was founded in 1931 , as H.W . Egli - Bull , to capitalize on the punched card technology patents of Norwegian engineer Fredrik Rosing Bull ( 1882-1925 ) . After a reorganization in 1933 , with new owners coming in , the name was changed to Compagnie des Machines Bull ( CMB ) . Bull has a worldwide presence in more than 100 countries , and is particularly active in the defense , finance , health care , manufacturing , public and telecommunication sectors .",
  "/wiki/Speakeasy_(computational_environment)": "Speakeasy is a numerical computing interactive environment also featuring an interpreted programming language . It was initially developed for internal use at the Physics Division of Argonne National Laboratory by the theoretical physicist Stanley Cohen . He eventually founded Speakeasy Computing Corporation to make the program available commercially . Speakeasy is a very long-lasting numerical package . In fact , the original version of the environment was built around a core dynamic data repository called Named storage developed in the early 1960s , while the most recent version has been released in 2006 . Speakeasy was aimed to make the computational work of the physicists at the Argonne National Laboratory easier . It was initially conceived to work on mainframes ( the only kind of computers at that time ) , and was subsequently ported to new platforms ( minicomputers , personal computers ) as they became available . The porting of the same code on different platforms was made easier by using Mortran metalanguage macros to face systems dependencies and compilers deficiencies and differences . Speakeasy is currently available on several platforms : PCs running Windows , macOS , Linux , departmental computers and workstations running several flavors of Linux , AIX or Solaris . Speakeasy was also among the first [ citation needed ] interactive numerical computing environments , having been implemented in such a way on a CDC 3600 system , and later on IBM TSO machines as one was in beta-testing at the Argonne National Laboratory at the time . Almost since the beginning ( as the dynamic linking functionality was made available in the operating systems ) Speakeasy features the capability of expanding its operational vocabulary using separated modules , dynamically linked to the core processor as they are needed . For that reason such modules were called linkules ( LINKable-modULES ) .",
  "/wiki/Argonne_National_Laboratory": "Argonne National Laboratory is a science and engineering research national laboratory operated by the University of Chicago Argonne LLC for the United States Department of Energy located in Lemont , Illinois , outside Chicago . It is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the Midwest . Argonne was initially formed to carry out Enrico Fermi 's work on nuclear reactors as part of the Manhattan Project , and it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1 , 1946 . In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics , designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors , helping design the reactors used by the USA 's nuclear navy , and a wide variety of similar projects . In 1994 , the lab 's nuclear mission ended , and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research , energy storage and renewable energy , environmental sustainability , supercomputing , and national security . UChicago Argonne , LLC , the operator of the laboratory , brings together the expertise of the University of Chicago ( the sole member of the LLC ) with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Argonne is a part of the expanding Illinois Technology and Research Corridor . Argonne formerly ran a smaller facility called Argonne National Laboratory-West ( or simply Argonne-West ) in Idaho next to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory . In 2005 , the two Idaho-based laboratories merged to become the Idaho National Laboratory .",
  "/wiki/CLU_(programming_language)": "CLU is a programming language created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) by Barbara Liskov and her students between 1974 and 1975 . While it did not find extensive use , it introduced many features that are used widely now , and is seen as a step in the development of object-oriented programming ( OOP ) . Key contributions include abstract data types , call-by-sharing , iterators , multiple return values ( a form of parallel assignment ) , type-safe parameterized types , and type-safe variant types . It is also notable for its use of classes with constructors and methods , but without inheritance .",
