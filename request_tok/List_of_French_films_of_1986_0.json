Critic Ginette Vincendeau defined the films made by Beineix and others as youth-oriented films with high production values.The look of the cin\u00e9ma du look refers to the films ' high investment in non-naturalistic , self-conscious aesthetics , notably intense colours and lighting effects . Their spectacular ( studio based ) and technically brilliant mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is usually put to the service of romantic plots . The cin\u00e9ma du look included the films of Luc Besson and L\u00e9os Carax . Luc Besson , like Beineix , was much maligned by the critical establishment during the 1980s , while Carax was much admired .
