  "/wiki/Pablo_Escobar": "Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria ( /\u02c8\u025bsk\u0259b\u0251\u02d0r/ ; 1 December 1949 - 2 December 1993 ) was a Colombian drug lord and narcoterrorist who founded and was the sole leader of the Medell\u00edn Cartel . Dubbed The King of Cocaine , Escobar is the wealthiest criminal in history , having amassed an estimated net worth of US $ 30 billion by the time of his death - equivalent to $ 59 billion as of 2019 - while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the United States in the 1980s and 1990s . Born in Rionegro and raised in Medell\u00edn , Escobar studied briefly at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Latinoamericana of Medell\u00edn , but left without graduating ; he instead began engaging in criminal activity , selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets , as well as participating in motor vehicle theft . In the early 1970s , he began to work for various drug smugglers , often kidnapping and holding people for ransom . In 1976 , Escobar founded the Medell\u00edn Cartel , which distributed powder cocaine , and established the first smuggling routes into the U.S. Escobar 's infiltration into the U.S. created exponential demand for cocaine , and by the 1980s , it was estimated Escobar led monthly shipments of 70 to 80 tons of cocaine into the country from Colombia . As a result , he quickly became one of the richest people in the world , but consistently battled rival cartels domestically and abroad , leading to massacres and the murders of police officers , judges , locals , and prominent politicians , making Colombia the murder capital of the world . In the 1982 parliamentary election , Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives as part of the Liberal Alternative movement . Through this , he was responsible for community projects , such as the construction of houses and football fields , which gained him popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented . However , Escobar was vilified by the Colombian and U.S. governments , who routinely stifled his political ambitions and pushed for his arrest , with Escobar widely believed to have orchestrated the DAS Building and Avianca Flight 203 bombings in retaliation . In 1991 , Escobar surrendered to authorities , and was sentenced to five years ' imprisonment on a host of charges , but struck a deal of no extradition with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria , with the ability of being housed in his own , self-built prison , La Catedral . In 1992 , Escobar escaped and went into hiding when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility , leading to a nation-wide manhunt . As a result , the Medell\u00edn Cartel crumbled , and in 1993 , Escobar was killed in his hometown by Colombian National Police , a day after his 44th birthday .",
