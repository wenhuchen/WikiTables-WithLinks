  "/wiki/SUVs": "Sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) is a category of motor vehicles that combine elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles , such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive . There is no commonly agreed definition of an SUV , and usage varies between countries . Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis ; however , broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV . A crossover SUV is defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction ( as per passenger cars ) , however in many cases crossovers are simply referred to as SUVs . In some countries - such as the United States - SUVs have been classified as light trucks , resulting in more lenient regulations compared to passenger cars . The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s , and the four-wheel drive station wagons and carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949 . The 1984 Jeep Cherokee ( XJ ) is considered to be the first SUV in the modern style . Most SUVs produced today use unibody construction ( as per passenger cars ) ; however , in the past many SUVs used body-on-frame construction . During the late 1990s and early 2000s , the popularity of SUVs greatly increased , often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons . More recently , smaller SUVs , mid-size and crossovers have become increasingly popular . SUVs are currently the world 's largest automotive segment and accounted for 36.8% of the world 's passenger car market in 2017 . SUVs are criticised for their impact on other road users and the environment .",
