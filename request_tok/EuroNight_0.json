With the establishment of new universities and cultural venues at the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 and throughout the 20th century , Krak\u00f3w reaffirmed its role as a major national academic and artistic centre .

With the population of 294,510 ( as of 2018 ) , it is the eleventh-largest city in Poland . The wider Katowice urban area has the population of approximately 2 to 3 million people . Throughout the mid-18th century , Katowice had developed into a village upon the discovery of rich coal reserves in the area . In 1742 the First Silesian War transferred Upper Silesia , including Katowice , to Prussia . Subsequently , from the second half of the 18th century , many German or Prussian craftsmen , merchants and artists began to settle in the region , which had been inhabited mostly by Poles over the past hundreds of years . Simultaneously Silesia experienced the influx of the first Jewish settlers . In the first half of the 19th century , intensive industrialization transformed local mills and farms into industrial steelworks , mines , foundries and artisan workshops . This also contributed to the establishment of companies and eventual rapid growth of the city . At the same time , Katowice became linked to the railway system with the first train arriving at the main station in 1847 . The outbreak of World War I was favourable for Katowice due to the prospering steel industry . Following Germany 's defeat and the Silesian Uprisings , Katowice and parts of Upper Silesia were annexed by the Second Polish Republic .",

A general Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944 led to even greater devastation and systematic razing by the Germans in advance of the Vistula-Oder Offensive .
