  "/wiki/Hawaii_Belt_Road": "The Hawai\u02bbi Belt Road is a modern name for the M\u0101malahoa Highway and consists of Hawai\u02bbi state Routes 11 , 19 , and 190 that encircle the Island of Hawai\u02bbi . The southern section , between Hilo and Kailua-Kona is numbered as Route 11 . The section between Hilo and Waimea is Route 19 . Between Waimea and Kailua-Kona , the road is split in two : the original mauka route ( now Route 190 ) and a makai Route 19 , completed in 1975 , which serves as access to the Kona and Kohala Coast resorts . In the Hawaiian language , mauka means towards the mountain and makai means towards the sea . These terms are commonly used in travel directions . Parts of the southern half of the Hawai\u02bbi Belt Road were known during the Territorial days as the Ka\u02bb\u016b Belt Road . The names Hawai\u02bbi Belt Road and M\u0101malahoa Highway refer to the road system that encircles the entire island ; many sections are also referenced by local names .",
  "/wiki/Hawaii_Volcanoes_National_Park": "Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park , established on August 1 , 1916 , is an American national park located in the U.S. state of Hawaii on the island of Hawaii . The park encompasses two active volcanoes : K\u012blauea , one of the world 's most active volcanoes , and Mauna Loa , the world 's most massive shield volcano . The park provides scientists with insight into the birth and development of the Hawaiian Islands , and ongoing studies into the processes of volcanism . For visitors , the park offers dramatic volcanic landscapes , as well as glimpses of rare flora and fauna . In recognition of its outstanding natural values , Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park was designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1987 . In 2012 , the park was depicted on the 14th quarter of the America the Beautiful Quarters series . On May 11 , 2018 , the park was closed to the public in the K\u012blauea volcano summit area , including the visitor center and park headquarters , due to explosions and toxic ash clouds from Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu , as well as earthquakes and road damage . Portions of the park , including the visitor center , reopened to the public on September 22 , 2018 . As of 2019 [ update ] , most of the park is open ; however , some road segments and trails , the Thurston Lava Tube , and the Jaggar Museum of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory remain closed to visitors . Eruptive activity , ground collapses and explosions in the park ceased in early August of 2018 , and the lull in eruptive activity at K\u012blauea continues .",
  "/wiki/Ainahou_Ranch": "The Shipman family leased 6,324 acres ( 2,559 ha ) of land near the K\u012blauea volcano in 1937 from the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate , which they called the Ainahou Ranch . The name \u02bbaina hou means new land . An older ranch called Keauhou ( not to be confused with the community of Keauhou , on the western side of the island ) had been established here in 1921 , so a primitive trail existed , and the Chain of Craters Road had recently been built within a few miles . Herbert C. Shipman built a house on the remote ranch in 1941 for the family as a refuge for the anticipated Japanese invasion of Hawaii . It was used as a working cattle ranch , raising beef for the military during World War II . After a tsunami in 1946 devastated the Puna Shipman property , killing half the endangered n\u0113n\u0113 he was raising there , he built pens at Ainahou to continue raising them . After the war , it was estimated only about 30 birds existed in the wild . Herbert Shipman reintroduced two pairs to the Pohakuloa Training Area , and worked with British ornithologist Peter Scott to expand the breeding program to England , possibly saving the species from extinction . The shipman family also kept many exotic plants at the ranch , including some of the first orchids raised on the island . Herbert ( president of the Hawaii Orchid Society ) was awarded a gold medal in 1957 by the American Orchid Society for contributions to the industry . After being threatened by a lava flow in 1969 , the house was evacuated . The family reached an agreement for the National Park Service to purchase the land and house in 1971 to become part of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park , under the authority of the Endangered Species Act .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",
  "/wiki/Hawaiian_goose": "The nene ( Branta sandvicensis or sandwicensis ) , also known as n\u0113n\u0113 and Hawaiian goose , is a species of bird endemic to the Hawaiian Islands . The official bird of the state of Hawai\u02bbi , the nene is exclusively found in the wild on the islands of Oahu , Maui , Kaua\u02bbi , Molokai , and Hawai\u02bbi . The Hawaiian name n\u0113n\u0113 comes from its soft call . The specific name sandvicensis refers to the Sandwich Islands , a former name for the Hawaiian Islands . It is thought that the nene evolved from the Canada goose ( Branta canadensis ) , which most likely arrived on the Hawaiian islands about 500,000 years ago , shortly after the island of Hawai\u02bbi was formed . This ancestor is the progenitor of the nene as well as the prehistoric Giant Hawai\u02bbi goose ( Branta rhuax ) and n\u0113n\u0113-nui ( Branta hylobadistes ) . The n\u0113n\u0113-nui was larger than the nene , varied from flightless to flighted depending on the individual , and inhabited the island of Maui . Similar fossil geese found on O\u02bbahu and Kaua\u02bbi may be of the same species . The Giant Hawai\u02bbi goose was restricted to the island of Hawai\u02bbi and measured 1.2 m ( 3.9 ft ) in length with a mass of 8.6 kg ( 19 lb ) , making it more than four times larger than the nene . It is believed that the herbivorous Giant Hawai\u02bbi goose occupied the same ecological niche as the goose-like ducks known as moa-nalo , which were not present on the Big Island . Based on mitochondrial DNA found in fossils , all Hawaiian geese , living and dead , are closely related to the giant Canada goose ( B. c. maxima ) and dusky Canada goose ( B. c. occidentalis ) .",

Lava eruptions from Mauna Loa are silica-poor and very fluid , and they tend to be non-explosive . Mauna Loa has probably been erupting for at least 700,000 years , and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000 years ago . The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000 years .

Historically , K\u012blauea is the most active of the five volcanoes that together form the island of Hawai\u02bbi . Located along the southeastern shore of the island , the volcano is between 210,000 and 280,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago . It is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain . Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa , K\u012blauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor . Structurally , K\u012blauea has a large , fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones , one extending 125 km ( 78 mi ) east and the other 35 km ( 22 mi ) west , as an active fault of unknown depth moving vertically an average of 2 to 20 mm ( 0.1 to 0.8 in ) per year . K\u012blauea erupted nearly continuously from 1983 to 2018 , causing considerable property damage , including the destruction of the towns of Kalapana and Kaim\u016b along with the renowned black sand beach , in 1990 . During the 2018 lower Puna eruption , two dozen lava vents erupted downrift from the summit in Puna . The eruption was accompanied by a strong earthquake on May 4 of Mw 6.9 , and nearly 2,000 residents were evacuated from the rural Leilani Estates subdivision and nearby areas . On May 17 , 2018 the volcano explosively erupted at the summit in Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu , throwing ash 30,000 feet into the air . Continued explosive activity at the summit caused a months-long closure of the K\u012blauea section of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park . Vigorous eruptive lava fountains in lower Puna sent destructive rivers of molten rock into the ocean in three places .",
