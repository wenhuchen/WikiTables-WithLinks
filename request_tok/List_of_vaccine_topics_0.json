  "/wiki/Dengue_virus": "Dengue virus ( DENV ) is the cause of dengue fever . It is a mosquito-borne , single positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae ; genus Flavivirus . Five serotypes of the virus have been found , all of which can cause the full spectrum of disease . Nevertheless , scientists ' understanding of dengue virus may be simplistic , as rather than distinct antigenic groups , a continuum appears to exist . This same study identified 47 strains of dengue virus . Additionally , coinfection with and lack of rapid tests for zika virus and chikungunya complicate matters in real-world infections . Dengue virus has increased dramatically within the last 20 years , becoming one of the worst mosquito-borne human pathogens with which tropical countries have to deal . Current estimates indicate that as many as 390 million infections occur each year , and many dengue infections are increasingly understood to be asymptomatic or subclinical .",
  "/wiki/Dengue_fever": "Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus . Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection . These may include a high fever , headache , vomiting , muscle and joint pains , and a characteristic skin rash . Recovery generally takes two to seven days . In a small proportion of cases , the disease develops into severe dengue , also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever , resulting in bleeding , low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage , or into dengue shock syndrome , where dangerously low blood pressure occurs . Dengue is spread by several species of female mosquitoes of the Aedes type , principally A. aegypti . The virus has five types ; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type , but only short-term immunity to the others . Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications . A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA . A vaccine for dengue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries . The vaccine , however , is only recommended in those who have been previously infected . [ needs update ] Other methods of prevention include reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites .",
  "/wiki/Dengue_vaccine": "Dengue vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent dengue fever in humans . As of 2019 [ update ] , one version is commercially available , known as CYD-TDV , and sold under the brand name Dengvaxia . The vaccine is only recommended in those who have previously had dengue fever or populations in which most people have been previously infected . The value of the vaccine is limited by the fact that it may worsen outcomes in those who have not previously been infected . It is given as three injections over a year . Common side effects include headache , pain at the site of injection , and general muscle pains . Severe side effects may include anaphylaxis . Use is not recommended in people with poor immune function . Safety of use during pregnancy is unclear . Dengvaxia is a weakened but live vaccine and works by triggering an immune response against four types of dengue virus . As of 2016 [ update ] , the dengue vaccine had been approved for medical use in eleven countries and in 2019 , was approved for medical use in the United States . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system .",

  "/wiki/Hepatitis_E": "Hepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus ( HEV ) . Hepatitis E has mainly a fecal-oral transmission route that is similar to hepatitis A , but the viruses are unrelated . In retrospect , the earliest known epidemic of hepatitis E occurred in 1955 in New Delhi , but the virus was not isolated until 1983 , by Russian scientists investigating an outbreak in Afghanistan . One of five known human hepatitis viruses : hepatitis A , B , C , D , and E , HEV is a positive-sense , single-stranded , nonenveloped , RNA icosahedral virus . Like hepatitis A , hepatitis E usually follows an acute and self-limiting course of illness ( the condition is temporary and the individual recovers ) with low death rates in resource-rich areas ; however , it can be more severe in pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system , with substantially higher death rates . In pregnant women , especially in the third trimester , the disease is more often severe and is associated with a clinical syndrome called fulminant liver failure , with death rates around 20% . Whereas pregnant women may have a rapid and severe course , organ transplant recipients who receive medications to weaken the immune system and prevent organ rejection can develop a slower and more persistent form called chronic hepatitis E , which is so diagnosed after 3 months of continuous viremia . HEV can be clustered genetically into 8 genotypes , and genotypes 3 and 4 tend to be the ones that cause chronic hepatitis in the immunosuppressed . In 2017 , hepatitis E was estimated to affect more than 19 million people . Those most commonly at risk of HEV are men aged 15 to 35 years of age . A preventive vaccine ( HEV 239 ) is approved for use in China .",

About 90% of HPV infections cause no symptoms and resolve spontaneously within two years . However , in some cases , an HPV infection persists and results in either warts or precancerous lesions . These lesions , depending on the site affected , increase the risk of cancer of the cervix , vulva , vagina , penis , anus , mouth , or throat . Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV ; two types , HPV16 and HPV18 , account for 70% of cases . Between 60% and 90% of the other cancers listed above are also linked to HPV . HPV6 and HPV11 are common causes of genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis . An HPV infection is caused by human papillomavirus , a DNA virus from the papillomavirus family . Over 170 types have been described . More than 40 types may be spread through sexual contact and infect the anus and genitals . Risk factors for persistent infection by sexually transmitted types include early age of first sexual intercourse , multiple sexual partners , smoking , and poor immune function .

The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry . Because of its short genome and its simple composition - only RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral protein coat that encapsulates it , poliovirus is widely regarded as the simplest significant virus . Poliovirus was first isolated in 1909 by Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper . The structure of the virus was first elucidated using x-ray diffraction by a team at Birkbeck College led by Rosalind Franklin , showing that the polio virus to have icosahedral symmetry . In 1981 , the poliovirus genome was published by two different teams of researchers : by Vincent Racaniello and David Baltimore at MIT and by Naomi Kitamura and Eckard Wimmer at Stony Brook University .

  "/wiki/Rabies_virus": "Rabies lyssavirus , formerly Rabies virus , is a neurotropic virus that causes rabies in humans and animals . Rabies transmission can occur through the saliva of animals and less commonly through contact with human saliva . Rabies lyssavirus , like many rhabdoviruses , has an extremely wide host range . In the wild it has been found infecting many mammalian species , while in the laboratory it has been found that birds can be infected , as well as cell cultures from mammals , birds , reptiles and insects . Rabies lyssavirus has a cylindrical morphology and is the type species of the Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family . These viruses are enveloped and have a single stranded RNA genome with negative-sense . The genetic information is packaged as a ribonucleoprotein complex in which RNA is tightly bound by the viral nucleoprotein . The RNA genome of the virus encodes five genes whose order is highly conserved . These genes code for nucleoprotein ( N ) , phosphoprotein ( P ) , matrix protein ( M ) , glycoprotein ( G ) and the viral RNA polymerase ( L ) . The complete genome sequences range from 11,615 to 11,966 nt in length . All transcription and replication events take place in the cytoplasm inside a specialized virus factory , the Negri body ( named after Adelchi Negri ) . These are 2-10 \u00b5m in diameter and are typical for a rabies infection and thus have been used as definite histological proof of such infection .",
  "/wiki/Rabies": "Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals . Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure . These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms : violent movements , uncontrolled excitement , fear of water , an inability to move parts of the body , confusion , and loss of consciousness . Once symptoms appear , the result is nearly always death . The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months , but can vary from less than one week to more than one year . The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system . Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses , including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus . It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animal . Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes , mouth , or nose . Globally , dogs are the most common animal involved . In countries where dogs commonly have the disease , more than 99% of rabies cases are the direct result of dog bites . In the Americas , bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans , and less than 5% of cases are from dogs .",

Doses are usually given by injection into the skin or muscle . After exposure vaccination is typically used along with rabies immunoglobulin . It is recommended that those who are at high risk of exposure be vaccinated before potential exposure . Vaccines are effective in humans and other animals . Vaccinating dogs is very effective in preventing the spread of rabies to humans . Rabies vaccines may be safely used in all age groups .

  "/wiki/Rotavirus": "Rotavirus is a genus of double-stranded RNA viruses in the family Reoviridae . Rotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhoeal disease among infants and young children . Nearly every child in the world is infected with a rotavirus at least once by the age of five . Immunity develops with each infection , so subsequent infections are less severe ; adults are rarely affected . There are nine species of the genus , referred to as A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H and I. Rotavirus A , the most common species , causes more than 90% of rotavirus infections in humans . The virus is transmitted by the faecal-oral route . It infects and damages the cells that line the small intestine and causes gastroenteritis ( which is often called stomach flu despite having no relation to influenza ) . Although Rotavirus was discovered in 1973 by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by electron micrograph images and accounts for approximately one third of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children , its importance has historically been underestimated within the public health community , particularly in developing countries . In addition to its impact on human health , rotavirus also infects animals , and is a pathogen of livestock . Rotaviral enteritis is usually an easily managed disease of childhood , but in 2013 , rotaviruses caused 37 percent of deaths of children from diarrhoea and 215,000 deaths worldwide , and almost two million more became severely ill . Most of these deaths occurred in developing countries . In the United States , before initiation of the rotavirus vaccination programme in the 2000s , rotavirus caused about 2.7 million cases of severe gastroenteritis in children , almost 60,000 hospitalisations , and around 37 deaths each year .",

It is not related to influenza , though it has erroneously been called the stomach flu . Gastroenteritis is usually caused by viruses . However , bacteria , parasites , and fungus can also cause gastroenteritis . In children , rotavirus is the most common cause of severe disease . In adults , norovirus and Campylobacter are common causes . Eating improperly prepared food , drinking contaminated water or close contact with a person who is infected can spread the disease . Treatment is generally the same with or without a definitive diagnosis , so testing to confirm is usually not needed . Prevention includes hand washing with soap , drinking clean water , proper disposal of human waste and breastfeeding babies instead of using formula .",

The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends that rotavirus vaccine be included in national routine vaccinations programs , especially in areas where the disease is common . This should be done along with promoting breastfeeding , handwashing , clean water , and good sanitation . It is given by mouth and requires two or three doses . It should be given starting around six weeks of age . The vaccines are safe . This includes their use in people with HIV/AIDS .

This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are infected . A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days . It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body . The rash is sometimes itchy and is not as bright as that of measles . Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks . A fever , sore throat , and fatigue may also occur . In adults joint pain is common . Complications may include bleeding problems , testicular swelling , and inflammation of nerves . Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome ( CRS ) or miscarriage . Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts , ears such as deafness , heart , and brain . Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy .",
  "/wiki/Rubella_vaccine": "Rubella vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent rubella . Effectiveness begins about two weeks after a single dose and around 95% of people become immune . Countries with high rates of immunization no longer see cases of rubella or congenital rubella syndrome . When there is a low level of childhood immunization in a population it is possible for rates of congenital rubella to increase as more women make it to child bearing age without either vaccination or exposure to the disease . Therefore , it is important for more than 80% of people to be vaccinated . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends that the rubella vaccine be included in routine vaccinations . If not all people are immunized then at least women of childbearing age should be immunized . It should not be given to those who are pregnant or those with very poor immune function . While one dose is often all that is required for lifelong protection , often two doses are given . Side effects are generally mild . They may include fever , rash , and pain and redness at the site of injection . Joint pain may be reported at between one and three weeks following vaccination in women .",

The disease most often manifests as meningitis , encephalitis , or meningoencephalitis . Long-lasting or permanent neuropsychiatric consequences are observed in 10 to 20% of infected patients . The number of reported cases has been increasing in most countries . TBE is posing a concerning health challenge to Europe , as the number of reported human cases of TBE in all endemic regions of Europe have increased by almost 400% within the last three decades . The tick-borne encephalitis virus is known to infect a range of hosts including ruminants , birds , rodents , carnivores , horses , and humans . The disease can also be spread from animals to humans , with ruminants and dogs providing the principal source of infection for humans .",

The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends immunizing all people in areas where the disease is common . Otherwise the vaccine is just recommended for those who are at high risk . Three doses are recommended followed by additional doses every three to five years . The vaccines can be used in people more than one or three years of age depending on the formulation .

  "/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus": "Human alphaherpesvirus 3 ( HHV-3 ) , usually referred to as the varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) , is one of nine herpesviruses known to infect humans . It causes chickenpox ( varicella ) , a disease most commonly affecting children , teens , and young adults , and shingles ( herpes zoster ) in adults ; shingles is rare in children . VZV is a worldwide pathogen known by many names : chickenpox virus , varicella virus , and zoster virus . VZV infections are species-specific to humans , but can survive in external environments for a few hours , maybe a day or two . VZV multiplies in the lungs , and causes a wide variety of symptoms . After the primary infection ( chickenpox ) , the virus goes dormant in the nerves , including the cranial nerve ganglia , dorsal root ganglia , and autonomic ganglia . Many years after the person has recovered from chickenpox , VZV can reactivate to cause neurologic conditions .",
  "/wiki/Chickenpox": "Chickenpox , also known as varicella , is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) . The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small , itchy blisters , which eventually scab over . It usually starts on the chest , back , and face . It then spreads to the rest of the body . Other symptoms may include fever , tiredness , and headaches . Symptoms usually last five to seven days . Complications may occasionally include pneumonia , inflammation of the brain , and bacterial skin infections . The disease is often more severe in adults than in children . Symptoms begin 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus . Chickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person . It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over . It may also spread through contact with the blisters .",
  "/wiki/Shingles": "Shingles , also known as zoster or herpes zoster , is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area . Typically the rash occurs in a single , wide stripe either on the left or right side of the body or face . Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area . [ needs update ] Otherwise there are typically few symptoms though some may have fever or headache , or feel tired . The rash usually heals within two to four weeks ; however , some people develop ongoing nerve pain which can last for months or years , a condition called postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) . In those with poor immune function the rash may occur widely . If the rash involves the eye , vision loss may occur . Shingles is due to a reactivation of varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) in a person 's body . The disease chickenpox is caused by the initial infection with VZV . Once chickenpox has resolved , the virus may remain inactive in nerve cells . When it reactivates , it travels from the nerve body to the endings in the skin , producing blisters . Risk factors for reactivation include old age , poor immune function , and having had chickenpox before 18 months of age .",
  "/wiki/Varicella_vaccine": "Varicella vaccine , also known as chickenpox vaccine , is a vaccine that protects against chickenpox . One dose of vaccine prevents 95% of moderate disease and 100% of severe disease . Two doses of vaccine are more effective than one . If given to those who are not immune within five days of exposure to chickenpox it prevents most cases of disease . Vaccinating a large portion of the population also protects those who are not vaccinated . It is given by injection just under the skin . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends routine vaccination only if a country can keep more than 80% of people vaccinated . If only 20% to 80% of people are vaccinated it is possible that more people will get the disease at an older age and outcomes overall may worsen . Either one or two doses of the vaccine is recommended . In the United States two doses are recommended starting at twelve to fifteen months of age . As of 2017 [ update ] , twenty-three countries recommend all non-medically exempt children receive the vaccine , nine recommend it only for high risk groups , three additional countries recommend use in only parts of the country , while other countries make no recommendation . Not all countries provide the vaccine due to its cost or concerns about an increase in chickenpox and shingles in adults .",
