  "/wiki/Brick": "A brick is building material used to make walls , pavements and other elements in masonry construction . Traditionally , the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay , but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil , sand , and lime , or concrete materials . Bricks can be joined together using mortar , adhesives or by interlocking them . Bricks are produced in numerous classes , types , materials , and sizes which vary with region and time period , and are produced in bulk quantities . Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks . Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials , but is usually larger than a brick . Lightweight bricks ( also called lightweight blocks ) are made from expanded clay aggregate . Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials , sometimes referred to as artificial stone , and have been used since circa 4000 BC . Air-dried bricks , also known as mudbricks , have a history older than fired bricks , and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw . Bricks are laid in courses and numerous patterns known as bonds , collectively known as brickwork , and may be laid in various kinds of mortar to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure .",
  "/wiki/National_Treasures_of_Japan": "A National Treasure ( \u56fd\u5b9d , kokuh\u014d ) is the most precious of Japan 's Tangible Cultural Properties , as determined and designated by the Agency for Cultural Affairs ( a special body of the Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology ) . A Tangible Cultural Property is considered to be of historic or artistic value , classified either as buildings and structures or as fine arts and crafts . Each National Treasure must show outstanding workmanship , a high value for world cultural history , or exceptional value for scholarship . Approximately 20% of the National Treasures are structures such as castles , Buddhist temples , Shinto shrines , or residences . The other 80% are paintings ; scrolls ; sutras ; works of calligraphy ; sculptures of wood , bronze , lacquer or stone ; crafts such as pottery and lacquerware carvings ; metalworks ; swords and textiles ; and archaeological and historical artifacts . The items span the period of ancient to early modern Japan before the Meiji period , including pieces of the world 's oldest pottery from the J\u014dmon period and 19th-century documents and writings . The designation of the Akasaka Palace in 2009 , the Tomioka Silk Mill in 2014 and of the Kaichi School added three modern , post-Meiji Restoration , National Treasures . Japan has a comprehensive network of legislation for protecting , preserving , and classifying its cultural patrimony . The regard for physical and intangible properties and their protection is typical of Japanese preservation and restoration practices . Methods of protecting designated National Treasures include restrictions on alterations , transfer , and export , as well as financial support in the form of grants and tax reduction . The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners with advice on restoration , administration , and public display of the properties . These efforts are supplemented by laws that protect the built environment of designated structures and the necessary techniques for restoration of works .",

  "/wiki/Wood": "Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants . It is an organic material - a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression . Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees , or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs . [ citation needed ] In a living tree it performs a support function , enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves . It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves , other growing tissues , and the roots . Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties , and to material engineered from wood , or wood chips or fiber . Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel , as a construction material , for making tools and weapons , furniture and paper . More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives , such as cellophane and cellulose acetate . As of 2005 , the growing stock of forests worldwide was about 434 billion cubic meters , 47% of which was commercial . As an abundant , carbon-neutral renewable resource , woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy . In 1991 approximately 3.5 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested . Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction .",

  "/wiki/Stone": "A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter . It is categorized by the minerals included , its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed . Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups : igneous rocks , metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks . Rocks form the Earth 's outer solid layer , the crust . Igneous rocks are formed when magma cools in the Earth 's crust , or lava cools on the ground surface or the seabed . The metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to such large pressures and temperatures that they are transformed - something that occurs , for example , when continental plates collide . The sedimentary rocks are formed by diagenesis or lithification of sediments , which in turn are formed by the weathering , transport , and deposition of existing rocks . The scientific study of rocks is called petrology , which is an essential component of geology .",
