The island has been a coconut plantation , and for growing cash crops such as papaya and cotton . Since 1967 it has been privately owned , and conservation measures have taken place such as protection of birdlife and hawksbill turtle nesting sites , the eradication of feral rats and rabbits and the translocation of a population of Seychelles sunbird . Bird Island is named in honour of its spectacular colony of around 700,000 pairs of sooty tern that nest on the island . The birds arrive from late March , laying eggs in May and remaining until October before leaving the island .
