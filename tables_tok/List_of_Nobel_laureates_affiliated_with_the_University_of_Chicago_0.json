  "intro": "This list of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Chicago comprehensively shows the alumni, faculty members as well as researchers of the University of Chicago who were awarded the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Prizes, established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, are awarded to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine. An associated prize, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics), was instituted by Sweden's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in 1968 and first awarded in 1969. As of October 2019[update], 100 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the University of Chicago. Among the 100 laureates, 95 are the laureates of the scientific Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Prize in Economics; 34 are UChicago alumni (graduates and attendees) and 48 have been long-term academic members of the university; and, subject-wise, 33 have won the Nobel Prize in Economics, more than any other subject (for verification, see Summary). This list considers Nobel laureates as equal individuals and does not consider their various prize shares or if they received the prize more than once."
