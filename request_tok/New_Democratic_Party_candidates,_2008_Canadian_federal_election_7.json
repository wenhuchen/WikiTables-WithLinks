She has a BA and MA in Philosophy from the University of Saskatchewan and a Ph.D in Philosophy from the University of Calgary . Wiebe first became widely known as the Women 's President from 1988-1994 and the President and CEO from 1995-1998 of the National Farmers Union . During her term she vocally defended the role of the Canadian Wheat Board in the marketing of prairie grains . In 2001 , Wiebe sought the leadership of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party ( and by implication , the office of Premier of Saskatchewan , as the party was in government at the time ) , following the retirement of then premier and party leader Roy Romanow . For the first time in Saskatchewan , the NDP utilized One Member One Vote as its means of selecting a leader rather than a delegated leadership convention . Wiebe ran on the most explicitly left-wing platform of the major contenders , and placed third behind Chris Axworthy and the eventual winner , Lorne Calvert . Wiebe chose not to run for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the subsequent 2003 provincial election . However , she did run , unsuccessfully , as the federal New Democratic Party candidate in the 2004 federal election in the riding of Saskatoon - Humboldt , against Conservative candidate Brad Trost , Liberal candidate Patrick Wolfe , and incumbent independent Jim Pankiw . In what was the closest four-way race in the country , Wiebe placed second , with only 417 fewer votes than the winner , Brad Trost , and only 18 more votes than Wolfe ( the third place candidate ) . In the 2006 Canadian federal election , Wiebe ran as the NDP candidate in the riding of Saskatoon - Rosetown - Biggar , but lost to incumbent Conservative Carol Skelton .",
