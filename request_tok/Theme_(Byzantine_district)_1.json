It was located some 55 km east of the Byzantine city of Theodosiopolis , in the district of Phasiane on the borderlands between Armenia and Iberia , on the left bank of the Araxes River . It is mentioned as the seat of a Byzantine strategos in the Escorial Taktikon ( c. 971/975 ) . It was ceded along with other cities to David III of Tao in 979 for his assistance in suppressing the rebellion of Bardas Skleros , but recovered after David 's death in 1000 , when it became part of the catepanate of Iberia . The town is chiefly known from the report of John Skylitzes , who writes that it was a popular trade centre , attracting merchants from Syria and Armenia and elsewhere . The town was sacked by the Seljuk Turks in 1048/49 , and its surviving inhabitants moved to Theodosiopolis , which they started to call in Armenian Arcn Rum ( Artze of the Romans [ i.e. , Byzantines ] ) . From this the later and current name of Theodosiopolis , Erzurum , derives . Artze should not be confused with the ancient and medieval town of Arzen further south .",

Its capital was Skopje and it was governed by a strategos . The local Slavic inhabitants were called by the Byzantines Bulgarians , whatever that meant . Nevertheless the Bulgarians kept their nationality , which reached particular strength after the Second Bulgarian Empire was formed in the 12th century . Initially the Byzantine emperor Basil II issued an order that the tax system of the subdued Bulgarian kingdom continue to be applied in the annexed Bulgarian lands . The Bulgarian patriarchate was downgraded to an archbishopric called Archbishopric of Ohrid , that retained an autocephalous status . The Bulgarian aristocracy also retained its position . Troops were recruited mainly from the Bulgarian population . However , only ten years later after the death of Basil II , the Byzantine tax system was introduced . Slavic literacy , liturgy and traditions of the Archbishopric were in some places subjected to persecution . Some of the Bulgarian aristocracy had slowly but consistently been removed from its position . Many were sent on assignments in other realms of the Empire remote from the Balkans .",

It is the country 's political , cultural , economic , and academic centre . The territory of Skopje has been inhabited since at least 4000 BC ; remains of Neolithic settlements have been found within the old Kale Fortress that overlooks the modern city centre . Originally a Paeonian city , Scupi became the capital of Dardania in the second century BC . On the eve of the 1st century AD , the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp . When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD , Scupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople . During much of the early medieval period , the town was contested between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire , whose capital it was between 972 and 992 . From 1282 , the town was part of the Serbian Empire and acted as its capital city from 1346 to 1371 . In 1392 , Skopje was conquered by the Ottoman Turks who called it \u00dcsk\u00fcb , with this name also being in use in English for a time . The town stayed under Ottoman control for over 500 years , serving as the capital of pashasanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcp and later the Vilayet of Kosovo . At that time the city was famous for its oriental architecture . [ citation needed ] In 1912 , it was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia during the Balkan Wars .",
  "/wiki/Samuel_of_Bulgaria": "Samuel was the Tsar ( Emperor ) of the First Bulgarian Empire from 997 to 6 October 1014 . From 977 to 997 , he was a general under Roman I of Bulgaria , the second surviving son of Emperor Peter I of Bulgaria , and co-ruled with him , as Roman bestowed upon him the command of the army and the effective royal authority . As Samuel struggled to preserve his country 's independence from the Byzantine Empire , his rule was characterized by constant warfare against the Byzantines and their equally ambitious ruler Basil II . In his early years Samuel managed to inflict several major defeats on the Byzantines and to launch offensive campaigns into their territory . In the late 10th century , the Bulgarian armies conquered the Serb principality of Duklja and led campaigns against the Kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary . But from 1001 , he was forced mainly to defend the Empire against the superior Byzantine armies . Samuel died of a heart attack on 6 October 1014 , two months after the catastrophic battle of Kleidion . His successors failed to organize a resistance , and in 1018 , four years after Samuel 's death , the country capitulated , ending the five decades-long Byzantine-Bulgarian conflict . Samuel was considered invincible in power and unsurpassable in strength . Similar comments were made even in Constantinople , where John Kyriotes penned a poem offering a punning comparison between the Bulgarian Emperor and Halley 's comet , which appeared in 989 . During Samuel 's reign , Bulgaria gained control of most of the Balkans ( with the notable exception of Thrace ) as far as southern Greece . He moved the capital from Skopje to Ohrid , which had been the cultural and military centre of southwestern Bulgaria since Boris I 's rule , and made the city the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate .",

  "/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Sicily": "The Muslim conquest of Sicily began in June 827 and lasted until 902 , when the last major Byzantine stronghold on the island , Taormina , fell . Isolated fortresses remained in Byzantine hands until 965 , but the island was henceforth under Muslim rule until conquered in turn by the Normans in the 11th century . Although Sicily had been raided by the Muslims since the mid-7th century , these raids did not threaten Byzantine control over the island , which remained a largely peaceful backwater . The opportunity for the Aghlabid emirs of Ifriqiya came in 827 , when the commander of the island 's fleet , Euphemius , rose in revolt against the Byzantine Emperor Michael II . Defeated by loyalist forces and driven from the island , Euphemius sought the aid of the Aghlabids . The latter regarded this as an opportunity for expansion and for diverting the energies of their own fractious military establishment and alleviate the criticism of the Islamic scholars by championing jihad , and dispatched an army to aid him . Following the Arab landing on the island , Euphemius was quickly sidelined . An initial assault on the island 's capital , Syracuse , failed , but the Muslims were able to weather the subsequent Byzantine counter-attack and hold on to a few fortresses . With the aid of reinforcements from Ifriqiya and al-Andalus , in 831 they took Palermo , which became the capital of the new Muslim province . The Byzantine government sent a few expeditions to aid the locals against the Muslims , but preoccupied with the struggle against the Abbasids on their eastern frontier and with the Cretan Saracens in the Aegean Sea , it was unable to mount a sustained effort to drive back the Muslims , who over the next three decades raided Byzantine possessions almost unopposed . The strong fortress of Enna in the centre of the island was the main Byzantine bulwark against Muslim expansion , until its capture in 859 . Following its fall , the Muslims increased their pressure against the eastern parts of the island , and after a long siege captured Syracuse in 878 .",

  "/wiki/Condominium_(international_law)": "In international law , a condominium ( plural either condominia , as in Latin , or condominiums ) is a political territory ( state or border area ) in or over which multiple sovereign powers formally agree to share equal dominium ( in the sense of sovereignty ) and exercise their rights jointly , without dividing it into national zones . Although a condominium has always been recognized as a theoretical possibility , condominia have been rare in practice . A major problem , and the reason so few have existed , is the difficulty of ensuring co-operation between the sovereign powers ; once the understanding fails , the status is likely to become untenable . The word is recorded in English since c. 1714 , from Modern Latin , apparently coined in Germany c. 1700 from Latin com- together + dominium right of ownership ( compare domain ) .

His success in battles against the Muslim states in the East definitively reversed the course of the centuries-long Byzantine-Arab Wars and began Byzantium 's 10th century Age of Conquest . Kourkouas belonged to a family of Armenian descent that produced several notable Byzantine generals . As commander of an imperial bodyguard regiment , Kourkouas was among the chief supporters of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos ( r. 920-944 ) and facilitated the latter 's rise to the throne . In 923 , Kourkouas was appointed commander-in-chief of the Byzantine armies along the eastern frontier , facing the Abbasid Caliphate and the semi-autonomous Muslim border emirates . He kept this post for more than twenty years , overseeing decisive Byzantine military successes that altered the strategic balance in the region . During the 9th century , Byzantium had gradually recovered its strength and internal stability while the Caliphate had become increasingly impotent and fractured . Under Kourkouas 's leadership , the Byzantine armies advanced deep into Muslim territory for the first time in almost 200 years , expanding the imperial border . The emirates of Melitene and Qaliqala were conquered , extending Byzantine control to the upper Euphrates and over western Armenia . The remaining Iberian and Armenian princes became Byzantine vassals . Kourkouas also played a role in the defeat of a major Rus ' raid in 941 and recovered the Mandylion of Edessa , an important and holy relic believed to depict the face of Jesus Christ .",

Although Byzantine authors use the term to describe the lands along the Danube in general , the province of Paristrion seems to have comprised mostly modern Dobruja . It is not certain exactly when the province was established : the Romanian scholar Nicolae B\u0103nescu considered that it was established immediately after the end of the Rus'-Byzantine War of 970-971 , while others , such as Vasil Zlatarski , thought it a later , mid-11th century creation . It was governed by a katepano or a doux , and was probably based at Dorostolon ( modern Silistra ) , where a Byzantine strategia ( generalcy ) is indeed attested in the 970s . In the aftermath of his victory over the Rus ' , Emperor John I Tzimiskes ( r. 969-976 ) appointed general Leo Sarakenopoulos as commander over north-eastern Bulgaria , based at Pereyaslavets/Ioannopolis . Sarakenopoulos and his subordinates engaged in major fortification activities in the region of the Dobruja over the next few years , where abandoned Roman-era forts were rebuilt and re-occupied . The region however fell back under Bulgarian control under the Cometopuli brothers in 986 and was held until c. 1001 , when Byzantine control was re-established . B\u0103nescu , however , considered that Dorostolon at least remained in Byzantine hands throughout . From the 1030s on , the region faced the continuous raids of the Pechenegs . The population was withdrawn to a few large fortified centres , and the Pechenegs were allowed to settle in the province as allies and colonists ( termed mixobarbaroi by contemporary authors ) and kept pacified through subsidies and through a vibrant trade . It was not until the early 1070s that the Pechenegs launched an open rebellion , and posed a constant threat to the Byzantine Empire 's Balkan provinces until decisively defeated at the Battle of Levounion in 1091 . Despite occasional Cuman raids thereafter , the Paristrion remained largely peaceful and prosperous in the 12th century .",
