  "/wiki/Tugboat": "A tugboat or tug is a type of vessel that maneuvers other vessels by pushing or pulling them either by direct contact or by means of a tow line . Tugs typically move vessels that either are restricted in their ability to maneuver on their own , such as ships in a crowded harbor or a narrow canal , or those that can not move by themselves , such as barges , disabled ships , log rafts , or oil platforms . Tugboats are powerful for their size and strongly built , and some are ocean-going . Some tugboats serve as icebreakers or salvage boats . Early tugboats had steam engines , but today most have diesel engines . Many tugboats have firefighting monitors , allowing them to assist in firefighting , especially in harbors .",

While the ship was completely wrecked , two small ships boats were saved and the crew attempted to return to Sydney . After travelling 200 miles ( 320 km ) , one of the boats was swamped and sank . The party split into two with one half walking back to Middle Island in the Recherch\u00e9 Archipelago and the others keeping time with them in the remaining boat . After considerable struggle they returned to Middle Island where they were found in an exhausted state with all their provisions gone by the sealing brig Nereus , under the command of Thomas Swindles on 8 December 1824 . All the crew were rescued and returned to Sydney on 11 March 1825 . In 1826 the schooner Liberty undertook salvage work and returned to Sydney with a quantity of iron work , including two sea anchors .",
  "/wiki/Brig": "A brig is a sailing vessel with two square-rigged masts . During the Age of Sail , brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels . They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries . Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind . Their rigging differs from that of a brigantine which has a gaff-rigged mainsail , while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail .",

The Castle-class trawler was originally built in 1920 for the United Kingdom Admiralty as the Thomas Alexander , and served most of its life as a trawler in French and English fisheries . It was renamed as Ben Dearg in 1936 and was requisitioned as a minesweeper in World War II in 1939 by the British Admiralty . The iron hulled trawler arrived in Albany in 1949 . The single screw steamer was coal burning , with a single ended boiler that generated 180lbs . per square inch of pressure of steam . Both Ben Dearg and the sister vessel Commiles were considered to be obsolete and unsuitable for fishing in the Great Australian Bight by 1951 , and were looking for fishing grounds closer to Albany which they could trawl safely . An attempt was made to sell the vessel by Anglo-Australian Fisheries Limited in February 1954 . Following the liquidation of Anglo-Australian Fisheries Limited , the trawler was sold to Krasnostein and Company , a company based in Perth , in June 1954 . It was advertised later in the year for \u00a38000 . The single screw steamer was scuttled on 14 April 1956 off Ben Dearg Beach near Swarbricks Beach , between Herald Point and Islet Point along the coast to the east of Albany in the Great Southern region of Western Australia , very close to the coal hulk Margaret .

  "/wiki/Perth": "Perth ( /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0r\u03b8/ ( listen ) PURTH ) is the capital and largest city of the Australian state of Western Australia ( WA ) . It is named after the city of Perth , Scotland and is Australia 's fourth-most populous city , with a population of 2.06 million living in Greater Perth . Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations . As part of Perth 's role as the capital of Western Australia , the state 's Parliament and Supreme Court are in the city , as is Government House , the residence of the Governor of Western Australia .",

Together with Garden Island , Rottnest Island is a remnant of Pleistocene dune ridges . The island covers 19 square kilometres ( 7.3 sq mi ) and is administered by the Rottnest Island Authority under a separate act of parliament . Rottnest is a popular destination , and there are daily services to Perth , the state 's capital and largest city . It has a permanent population of around 300 people , with around 500000 annual visitors ( and up to 15000 visitors at a time during peak periods ) . On 28 April 2017 the government of Western Australia announced that the Department of Parks and Wildlife would merge with the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority , the Zoological Parks Authority , and the Rottnest Island Authority on 1 July 2017 to form the Department of Biodiversity , Conservation and Attractions . Rottnest is well known for its population of quokkas , a small native marsupial found in very few other locations . The island is also home to colonies of Australian sea lions and southern fur seals . A number of native and introduced bird species nest near the shallow salt lakes in the island 's interior , and Rottnest has consequently been designated an Important Bird Area .

  "/wiki/HMAS_Derwent_(DE_49)": "HMAS Derwent ( F22/DE 22/DE 49 ) , named for the Derwent River , was a River-class destroyer escort of the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . She was laid down by Williamstown Naval Dockyard in 1959 , and commissioned into the RAN in 1964 . During the ship 's career , she was deployed to South East Asia on 23 occasions , including operations during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation , and escort of the troopship HMAS Sydney to and from the Vietnam War . Multiple flag-showing cruises were also embarked upon , with port visits throughout Asia , the Indian Ocean , and the Pacific Ocean . Derwent was also briefly used to portray a fictional vessel for the British drama series Warship . A major modernisation occurred between 1981 and 1985 . In 1987 , the ship 's home port was changed to HMAS Stirling ( Fleet Base West ) . In addition to usual exercises and operations , Derwent assisted with the 1987 America 's Cup and the First Fleet Re-enactment Voyage . Between 1992 and 1993 , the ship was used for pilotage training cruises . Derwent was paid off in 1994 , and used by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation ( DSTO ) for ship survivability testing . Although it was originally intended to sink the ship as a dive wreck , the nature of the damage from the DSTO program made it unaffordable to render the ship diver-safe , so Derwent was towed to deep water off Rottnest Island and scuttled .",

The first two vessels had some slight modifications to the design , while the next two underwent further changes . Two more ships were ordered in 1964 , following the Melbourne-Voyager collision ; these were based on the Type 12I ( or Leander-class ) frigate . By the 1990s , all six ships had left service . Two were sunk as part of tests , and a third was scuttled as an artificial reef , while the other three ships were scrapped .",
  "/wiki/Destroyer_escort": "Destroyer escort ( DE ) was the United States Navy mid-20th-century classification for a 20-knot ( 23 mph ) warship designed with endurance to escort mid-ocean convoys of merchant marine ships . Kaib\u014dkan were designed for a similar role in the Imperial Japanese Navy . The Royal Navy and Commonwealth forces identified such warships as frigates , and that classification was widely accepted when the United States redesignated destroyer escorts as frigates ( FF ) in 1975 . From circa 1954 until 1975 new-build US Navy ships designated as destroyer escorts ( DE ) were called ocean escorts . Destroyer escorts , frigates , and kaib\u014dkan were mass-produced for World War II as a less expensive antisubmarine warfare alternative to fleet destroyers . Other similar warships include the 10 Kriegsmarine escort ships of the F-class and the two Amiral Murgescu-class vessels of the Romanian Navy . Postwar destroyer escorts and frigates were larger than those produced during wartime , with increased antiaircraft capability , but remained smaller and slower than postwar destroyers . As Cold War destroyer escorts became as large as wartime destroyers , the United States Navy converted some of their World War II destroyers to escort destroyers ( DDE ) .",

Though heralding the way forward in the change from sail to steam on the long Western Australian coast , like its predecessor SS Xantho , Georgette had a short and ill-starred career and sank soon after its arrival there .",
  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship , often referred to as a steamer , is a type of steam-powered vessel , typically ocean-faring and seaworthy , that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move ( turn ) propellers or paddlewheels . The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s ; however , there were exceptions that came before . Steamships usually use the prefix designations of PS for paddle steamer or SS for screw steamer ( using a propeller or screw ) . As paddle steamers became less common , SS is assumed by many to stand for steamship . Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as MV for motor vessel , so it is not correct to use SS for most modern vessels . As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns , new trade routes opened up . The steamship has been described as a major driver of the first wave of trade globalization ( 1870-1913 ) and contributor to an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history .",

Mandurah 's central business district is located on the Mandurah Estuary , which is an outlet for the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary . The city 's name is derived from a Noongar word meaning meeting place or trading place . A townsite for Mandurah was laid out in 1831 , two years after the establishment of the Swan River Colony , but attracted few residents . Until the post-war boom of the 1950s and 1960s it was little more than a small fishing village . In subsequent years , Mandurah 's reputation for boating and fishing attracted many retirees , especially to the canal developments in the city 's south . The 1000-hectare suburb of Halls Head was developed during the 1980s by the Parry Corporation and the state Government Employees Superannuation Board - one of the notorious WA Inc deals which later gave rise to a royal commission . :4-69 Along with four other local government areas ( Boddington , Murray , Serpentine-Jarrahdale , and Waroona ) , the City of Mandurah is included in the wider Peel region . Mandurah is sometimes grouped together with Perth for statistical purposes , especially since the extension of the Kwinana Freeway and the completion of the Mandurah railway line in the late 2000s .

Since the first specialized bulk carrier was built in 1852 , economic forces have led to continued development of these ships , resulting in increased size and sophistication . Today 's bulk carriers are specially designed to maximize capacity , safety , efficiency , and durability . Today , bulk carriers make up 21% of the world 's merchant fleets and range in size from single-hold mini-bulk carriers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400,000 metric tons of deadweight ( DWT ) . A number of specialized designs exist : some can unload their own cargo , some depend on port facilities for unloading , and some even package the cargo as it is loaded . Over half of all bulk carriers have Greek , Japanese , or Chinese owners and more than a quarter are registered in Panama . South Korea is the largest single builder of bulk carriers , and 82% of these ships were built in Asia . On bulk carriers , crew are involved in operation management and maintenance of the vessel taking care of safety , navigation , maintenance and cargo care , in accordance with international maritime legislation .

Originally the merchant vessel Steiermark , the ship was acquired by the navy following the outbreak of war for conversion into a raider . Administered under the designation Schiff 41 , to the Allied navies she was known as Raider G. The largest merchant raider operated by Germany during World War II , Kormoran was responsible for the destruction of 10 merchant vessels and the capture of an 11th during her year-long career in the Atlantic and Indian oceans . She is also known for sinking the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney during a mutually destructive battle off Western Australia on 19 November 1941 . Damage sustained during the battle prompted the scuttling of Kormoran . While 318 of the 399 aboard the German ship were rescued and placed in prisoner of war camps for the duration of World War II , there were no survivors from the 645 aboard the Australian cruiser . The wreck of Kormoran was rediscovered on 12 March 2008 , five days before that of her adversary . Kormoran 's success against HMAS Sydney is commonly attributed to the proximity of the two ships during the engagement , and the raider 's advantages of surprise and rapid , accurate fire . Prior to the discovery of the wrecks in 2008 , the cruiser 's loss with all hands compared to the survival of most of the German crew created controversy and spawned numerous conspiracy theories ; some alleged that the German commander , Theodor Detmers , used illegal ruses to lure Sydney into range , others that a Japanese submarine was involved , or that details of the battle were concealed through a wide-ranging coverup .",

Ordered for the Royal Navy as HMS Phaeton , the cruiser was purchased by the Australian government and renamed prior to her 1934 launch . During the early part of her operational history , Sydney helped enforce sanctions during the Abyssinian crisis , and at the start of World War II was assigned to convoy escort and patrol duties in Australian waters . In May 1940 , Sydney joined the British Mediterranean Fleet for an eight-month deployment , during which she sank two Italian warships , participated in multiple shore bombardments , and provided support to the Malta Convoys , while receiving minimal damage and no casualties . On her return to Australia in February 1941 , Sydney resumed convoy escort and patrol duties in home waters .
