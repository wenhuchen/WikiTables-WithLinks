  "intro": "Hungary competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Hungarian athletes have competed at every Summer Olympic Games in the modern era, except the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles because of the Soviet boycott. The Hungarian Olympic Committee (Hungarian: Magyar Olimpiai Bizotts\u00e1g, MOB) sent a total of 209 athletes to the Games, 119 men and 90 women, to compete in 20 sports. Water polo and handball were the only team-based sports in which Hungary had its representation in these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in road cycling and mountain biking. The Hungarian team featured several Olympic medalists from Sydney, including the men's water polo team (led by Tibor Benedek), \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer T\u00edmea Nagy, sprint kayakers Zolt\u00e1n Kammerer, Gy\u00f6rgy Kolonics (who later died in 2008 due to heart failure), and Katalin Kov\u00e1cs, and breaststroke and medley swimmer \u00c1gnes Kov\u00e1cs. Table tennis player Csilla B\u00e1torfi became the first female Hungarian athlete to compete in five Olympic Games as one of the most sophisticated members of the team. Along with Kolonics and Benedek, six Hungarian athletes had made their fourth Olympic appearance, including fencer Iv\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs and half-heavyweight judoka Antal Kov\u00e1cs, who was assigned by the committee to become the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Race walker Zolt\u00e1n Czukor, aged 41, was the oldest member of the team, while backstroke swimmer Evelyn Verraszt\u00f3 was the youngest at age 15. Hungary left Athens with a total of 17 Olympic medals, 8 golds, 6 silver, and 3 bronze, matching its overall tally with Sydney four years earlier. Almost a third of these medals were awarded to the athletes in sprint canoeing, three in fencing, and two in swimming. Skeet shooter Di\u00e1na Igaly and modern pentathlete Zsuzsanna V\u00f6r\u00f6s won Olympic gold medals for the first time in their respective sporting events by a female."
