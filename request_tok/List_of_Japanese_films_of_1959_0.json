These films were contemporary with , and associated with , the French New Wave ( la nouvelle vague ) , though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement . He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics . He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol , Marguerite Duras , Alain Robbe-Grillet , Jorge Sempr\u00fan and Jacques Sternberg . In later films , Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms , including theatre , music , and comic books . This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn , Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh , as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song .

  "/wiki/Chambara": "Chanbara ( \u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d0\u30e9 ) , also commonly spelled chambara , meaning sword fighting movies , denotes the Japanese film genre called samurai cinema in English and is roughly equivalent to western cowboy and swashbuckler films . Chanbara is a sub-category of jidaigeki , which equates to period drama . Jidaigeki may refer to a story set in a historical period , though not necessarily dealing with a samurai character or depicting swordplay . While earlier samurai period pieces were more dramatic rather than action-based , samurai movies produced post World War II have become more action-based , with darker and more violent characters . Post war samurai epics tended to portray psychologically or physically scarred warriors . Akira Kurosawa stylized and exaggerated death and violence in samurai epics . His samurai , and many others portrayed in film , were solitary figures , more often concerned with concealing their martial abilities , rather than showing them off . Historically , the genre is usually set during the Tokugawa era ( 1600-1868 ) . The samurai film hence often focuses on the end of an entire way of life for the samurai : many of the films deal with masterless r\u014dnin , or samurai dealing with changes to their status resulting from a changing society . Samurai films were constantly made into the early 1970s , but by then , overexposure on television , the aging of the big stars of the genre , and the continued decline of the mainstream Japanese film industry put a halt to most of the production of this genre .",
