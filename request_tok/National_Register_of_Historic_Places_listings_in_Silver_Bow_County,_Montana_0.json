  "/wiki/Butte,_Montana": "Butte is the county seat of Silver Bow County , Montana , United States . In 1977 , the city and county governments consolidated to form the sole entity of Butte-Silver Bow . The city covers 718 square miles ( 1,860 km2 ) , and , according to the 2010 census , has a population of 33,503 , making it Montana 's fifth largest city . It is served by Bert Mooney Airport with airport code BTM . Established in 1864 as a mining camp in the northern Rocky Mountains on the Continental Divide , Butte experienced rapid development in the late-nineteenth century , and was Montana 's first major industrial city . In its heyday between the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries , it was one of the largest copper boomtowns in the American West . Employment opportunities in the mines attracted surges of Asian and European immigrants , particularly the Irish ; as of 2017 , Butte has the largest population of Irish Americans per capita of any city in the United States . Butte was also the site of various historical events involving its mining industry and active labor unions and Socialist politics , the most famous of which was the labor riot of 1914 . Despite the dominance of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company , Butte was never a company town . Other major events in the city 's history include the 1917 Speculator Mine disaster , the largest hard rock mining disaster in world history . Over the course of its history , Butte 's mining and smelting operations generated an excess of $ 48 billion worth of ore , but also resulted in numerous environmental implications for the city : The upper Clark Fork River , with headwaters at Butte , is the largest Superfund site in the United States , and the city is also home to the Berkeley Pit . In the late-twentieth century , cleanup efforts from the EPA were instated , and the Butte Citizens Technical Environmental Committee was established in 1984 .",

  "/wiki/Continental_Divide": "The Continental Divide of the Americas ( also known as the Great Divide , the Western Divide or simply the Continental Divide ; Spanish : Divisoria continental de Am\u00e9rica , Gran Divisoria ) is the principal , and largely mountainous , hydrological divide of the Americas . The Continental Divide extends from the Bering Strait to the Strait of Magellan , and separates the watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean from those river systems that drain into the Atlantic Ocean ( including those that drain into the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea ) and , along the northernmost reaches of the Divide , those river systems that drain into the Arctic Ocean . Although there are many other hydrological divides in the Americas , the Continental Divide is by far the most prominent of these because it tends to follow a line of high peaks along the main ranges of the Rocky Mountains and Andes , at a generally much higher elevation than the other hydrological divisions .",
  "/wiki/Homestake_Pass": "Homestake Pass is a mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of Montana in the United States . It sits on the Continental Divide on the border between Jefferson County and Silver Bow County , six miles south-southeast of Butte in Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest at an elevation of 6,329 feet ( 1,929 m ) . The pass carries Interstate 90 across the Continental Divide and is the highest point on the 3,020 mi ( 4,861 km ) highway . The pass was discovered by Edwin Harrison McHenry , a civil engineer working for the Northern Pacific Railway , who was tasked with locating a route for the NP from the main line near Logan , Montana through to Butte . The line over the pass from Logan to Garrison , Montana via Butte became the Rocky Mountain Division , Second and Fourth Subdivisions , built in 1889 . This was Northern Pacific 's scenic transcontinental passenger train route used by the famous North Coast Limited and its Amtrak successor , the North Coast Hiawatha , which was discontinued in 1979 . The line over the pass is currently owned by BNSF Railway . It has been inactive since 1983 , as its grades and curvature are poorly suited to freight trains , which ( now operated by Montana Rail Link ) utilize the former Northern Pacific 's easier route via Helena . It is unlikely that the rail line over the pass will ever be used again , but BNSF has resisted tearing out the line because the original lease with the Northern Pacific and the US Forest Service requires that the grade be returned to its original status , a very costly process . When Interstate 90 was built , the state of Montana used Homestake Pass to cross the Continental Divide , thereby providing an easier alternative to the US Route 10 route over the Divide at Pipestone Pass . A trail running race currently takes place annually on the Continental Divide Trail between Homestake Pass and Pipestone Pass . Hosted by Butte 's Piss and Moan Running Club , the Wulfman CDT 14k is held on the Saturday closest to the Summer solstice .",
  "/wiki/Beaverhead-Deerlodge_National_Forest": "The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest is the largest of the National Forests in Montana , United States . Covering 3.36 million acres ( 13,600 km2 ) , the forest is broken into nine separate sections and stretches across eight counties in the southwestern area of the state . President Theodore Roosevelt named the two forests in 1908 and they were merged in 1996 . Forest headquarters are located in Dillon , Montana . In Roosevelt 's original legislation , the Deerlodge National Forest was called the Big Hole Forest Reserve . He created this reserve because the Anaconda Copper Mining Company , based in Butte , Montana , had begun to clearcut the upper Big Hole River watershed . The subsequent erosion , exacerbated by smoke pollution from the Anaconda smelter , was devastating the region . Ranchers and conservationists alike complained to Roosevelt , who made several trips to the area . ( Munday 2001 ) The greatest part of the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness is located in the larger Beaverhead National Forest portion of 2,130,671 acres ( 8,622.52 km2 ) , which is 64% of the total area of the forest . The rest of this wilderness extends into the neighboring Deerlodge and Bitterroot National Forests . The Beaverhead section includes most of the Pioneer , Gravelly , and Sapphire Ranges . Both the Centennial and Bitterroot mountain ranges are also located here , with the Continental divide found in the Bitterroot range .",

Unlike later drive-ins , which frequently featured a streamline moderne style , or at least an acknowledgement of their orientation to automobile-oriented customers , Matt 's Place was a straightforward conversion of a house to serve customers in cars .
