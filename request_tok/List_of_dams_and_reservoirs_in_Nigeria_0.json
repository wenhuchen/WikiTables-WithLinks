The Gada river flows for only about four months each year , with a catchment area at Jibiya of over 400 km2 . Due to the loose sandy nature of the surface soil , a flexible impervious liner was used that could adapt to settling or deformation of the embankment . An assessment of the dam in 2004 rated its condition good but noted that no instrument readings had been made since 1994 due to lack of training of the operators . As of 2007 , the dam was not being used for irrigation due to lack of fuel to run the pumps . The Gada River flows from Nigeria into Niger and then back into Nigeria . In the past , it was dry for eight months of the year . There is now a regulated flow throughout the year , which has improved the water supply in Niger .",
