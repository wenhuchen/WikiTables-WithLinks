  "/wiki/Baduhenna": "In Germanic paganism , Baduhenna is a goddess . Baduhenna is solely attested by Tacitus 's Annals where Tacitus records that a grove in ancient Frisia was dedicated to her , and that near this grove 900 Roman soldiers were killed in 28 CE . Scholars have analyzed the name of the goddess and linked the figure to the Germanic Matres and Matronae .",
  "/wiki/Proto-Germanic": "Proto-Germanic ( abbreviated PGmc ; also called Common Germanic ) is the reconstructed proto-language of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages . Proto-Germanic developed from pre-Proto-Germanic into three branches during the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era : West Germanic , East Germanic and North Germanic , which however remained in contact over a considerable time , especially the Ingvaeonic languages ( including English ) , which arose from West Germanic dialects and remained in continued contact with North Germanic . A defining feature of Proto-Germanic is the completion of the process described by Grimm 's law , a set of sound changes that occurred between its status as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European and its gradual divergence into a separate language . As it is probable that the development of this sound shift spanned a considerable time ( several centuries ) , Proto-Germanic can not adequately be reconstructed as a simple node in a tree model but rather represents a phase of development that may span close to a thousand years . The end of the Common Germanic period is reached with the beginning of the Migration Period in the fourth century . The alternative term Germanic parent language may be used to include a larger scope of linguistic developments , spanning the Nordic Bronze Age and Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe ( second to first millennia BC ) to include Pre-Germanic ( PreGmc ) , Early Proto Germanic ( EPGmc ) and Late Proto-Germanic ( LPGmc ) . While Proto-Germanic refers only to the reconstruction of the most recent common ancestor of Germanic languages , the Germanic parent language refers to the entire journey that the dialect of Proto-Indo-European that would become Proto-Germanic underwent through the millennia . The Proto-Germanic language is not directly attested by any coherent surviving texts ; it has been reconstructed using the comparative method . Fragmentary direct attestation exists of ( late ) Common Germanic in early runic inscriptions ( specifically the second-century AD Vimose inscriptions and the second-century BC Negau helmet inscription ) , and in Roman Empire era transcriptions of individual words ( notably in Tacitus ' Germania , c. 90 CE ) .",
  "/wiki/Matrons": "Matron is the job title of a very senior or the chief nurse in several countries , including the United Kingdom , its former colonies , such as India , and also the Republic of Ireland . The chief nurse , in other words the person in charge of nursing in a hospital and the head of the nursing staff , is also known as the Senior Nursing Officer , matron , nursing officer , or clinical nurse manager in UK English ; the head nurse or director of nursing in US English , and the nursing superintendent or matron in Indian English , among other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations . In the United Kingdom , matrons today have powers over budgets , catering and cleaning as well as being in charge of nurses and have the powers to withhold payments from catering and cleaning services if they do n't think they are giving the best service to the NHS . Historically , matrons supervised the hospital as a whole but today , they are in-charge of supervising two or three wards . The chief nurse is a registered nurse who supervises the care of all the patients at a health care facility . The chief nurse is the senior nursing management position in an organization and often holds executive titles like chief nursing officer ( CNO ) , chief nurse executive , or vice-president of nursing . They typically report to the CEO or COO .",
  "/wiki/Annals_(Tacitus)": "The Annals ( Latin : Annales ) by Roman historian and senator Tacitus is a history of the Roman Empire from the reign of Tiberius to that of Nero , the years AD 14-68 . The Annals are an important source for modern understanding of the history of the Roman Empire during the 1st century AD ; it is Tacitus ' final work , and modern historians generally consider it his greatest writing . Historian Ronald Mellor calls it Tacitus 's crowning achievement , which represents the pinnacle of Roman historical writing . Tacitus ' Histories and Annals together amounted to 30 books ; although some scholars disagree about which work to assign some books to , traditionally 14 are assigned to Histories and 16 to Annals . Of the 30 books referred to by Jerome about half have survived . Modern scholars believe that as a Roman senator , Tacitus had access to Acta Senatus - the Roman senate 's records - which provided a solid basis for his work . Although Tacitus refers to part of his work as my annals , the title of the work Annals used today was not assigned by Tacitus himself , but derives from its year-by-year structure . The name of the current manuscript seems to be Books of History from the Death of the Divine Augustus ( Ab Excessu divi Augusti Historiarum Libri ) .",

Both Hj\u00faki and Bil are solely attested in the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson . Scholarly theories that surround the two concern their nature , their role as potential personifications of the craters on the Moon or its phases , and their relation to later folklore in Germanic Europe . Bil has been identified with the Bilwis , an agriculture-associated figure that is frequently attested in the folklore of German-speaking areas of Europe .",

Beyla is mentioned in stanzas 55 , 66 , and the prose introduction to the Poetic Edda poem Lokasenna . Since this is the only mention of Beyla , scholars have turned to the etymology of Beyla 's name for additional information about her . However , the meaning of her name is unclear and her name has been proposed as related to cow , bean , or bee .",
  "/wiki/Byggvir": "Byggvir is a figure in Norse mythology . The only surviving mention of Byggvir appears in the prose beginning of Lokasenna , and stanzas 55 through 56 of the same poem , where he is referred to as one of Freyr 's servants and as the husband of Beyla . Bygg is the Old Norse word for barley . Subsequently , Byggvir is often identified with this etymology of his name and connections have been placed with the mentioning of Byggvir 's described involvement with mill-grinding as being potential references to barley processing . Comparisons to the Anglo-Saxon figure of Beowa ( Old English barley ) have been put forth .",
  "/wiki/Poetic_Edda": "Poetic Edda is the modern attribution for an unnamed collection of Old Norse anonymous poems , which is different from the Edda written by Snorri Sturluson . Several versions exist , all primarily of text from the Icelandic medieval manuscript known as the Codex Regius . The Codex Regius is arguably the most important extant source on Norse mythology and Germanic heroic legends . From the early-19th century onwards it has had a powerful influence on later Scandinavian literatures - not only through its stories , but also through the visionary force and the dramatic quality of many of the poems . It has also become an inspiring model for many later innovations in poetic meter , particularly in Nordic languages , offering many varied examples of terse , stress-based metrical schemes that lack any final rhyme but instead use alliterative devices and strongly-concentrated imagery . Poets who have acknowledged their debt to the Codex Regius include Vilhelm Ekelund , August Strindberg , J. R. R. Tolkien , Ezra Pound , Jorge Luis Borges , and Karin Boye . Codex Regius was written during the 13th century , but nothing was known of its whereabouts until 1643 , when it came into the possession of Brynj\u00f3lfur Sveinsson , then Bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt . At the time , versions of the Edda were known in Iceland , but scholars speculated that there once was another Edda , an Elder Edda , which contained the pagan poems that Snorri quotes in his Edda . When Codex Regius was discovered , it seemed that the speculation had proved correct , but modern scholarly research has shown that the Edda was likely written first and that the two were , at most , connected by a common source . Brynj\u00f3lfur attributed the manuscript to S\u00e6mundr the Learned , a larger-than-life 12th century Icelandic priest . Modern scholars reject that attribution , but the name S\u00e6mundar Edda is still sometimes associated with both the Codex Regius and versions of Poetic Edda using it as a source . Bishop Brynj\u00f3lfur sent Codex Regius as a present to the Danish king - hence the name given to the codex : Latin : codex regius , lit .",
  "/wiki/Eir": "In Norse mythology , Eir ( Old Norse protection , help , mercy ) is a goddess or valkyrie associated with medical skill . Eir is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources ; the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson ; and in skaldic poetry , including a runic inscription from Bergen , Norway from around 1300 . Scholars have theorized about whether these three sources refer to the same figure , and debate whether Eir may have been originally a healing goddess or a valkyrie . In addition , Eir has been theorized as a form of the goddess Frigg and has been compared to the Greek goddess Hygieia .",

By way of linguistic reconstruction , the matter of a goddess called *Austr\u014d in the Proto-Germanic language has been examined in detail since the foundation of Germanic philology in the 19th century by scholar Jacob Grimm and others . As the Germanic languages descend from Proto-Indo-European ( PIE ) , historical linguists have traced the name to a Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn *H\u2082ews\u1e53s ( \u2192 *Aus\u1e53s ) , from which descends the Common Germanic divinity from whom \u0112ostre and Ostara are held to descend . Additionally , scholars have linked the goddess 's name to a variety of Germanic personal names , a series of location names ( toponyms ) in England , and , discovered in 1958 , over 150 inscriptions from the 2nd century CE referring to the matronae Austriahenae . Theories connecting \u0112ostre with records of Germanic Easter customs , including hares and eggs , have been proposed . Particularly prior to the discovery of the matronae Austriahenae and further developments in Indo-European studies , debate has occurred among some scholars about whether or not the goddess was an invention of Bede . \u0112ostre and Ostara are sometimes referenced in modern popular culture and are venerated in some forms of Germanic neopaganism .",
  "/wiki/De_temporum_ratione": "The Reckoning of Time ( Latin : De temporum ratione ) is an Anglo-Saxon era treatise written in Medieval Latin by the Northumbrian monk Bede in 725 . The treatise includes an introduction to the traditional ancient and medieval view of the cosmos , including an explanation of how the spherical Earth influenced the changing length of daylight , of how the seasonal motion of the Sun and Moon influenced the changing appearance of the new moon at evening twilight , and a quantitative relation between the changes of the tides at a given place and the daily motion of the Moon . The Reckoning of Time describes the principal ancient calendars , including those of the Hebrews , the Egyptians , the Romans , the Greeks , and the Anglo-Saxons . The focus of De temporum ratione was calculation of the date of Easter , for which Bede described the method developed by Dionysius Exiguus . De temporum ratione also gave instructions for calculating the date of the Easter full moon , for calculating the motion of the Sun and Moon through the zodiac , and for many other calculations related to the calendar . Bede based his reasoning for the dates on the Hebrew Bible . The functions of the universe and its purpose are generally referenced by scripture . According to the introduction by Faith Wallis in the 1999 English translated edition of The Reckoning of Time , Bede aimed to write a Christian work that integrated the astronomical understanding of computing with a theological context of history . The book is also regarded by Bede to be a sequel to his works The Nature of Things and On Time .",

According to Adam of Bremen , Freyr was associated with peace and pleasure , and was represented with a phallic statue in the Temple at Uppsala . According to Snorri Sturluson , Freyr was the most renowned of the \u00e6sir , and was venerated for good harvest and peace . In the mythological stories in the Icelandic books the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda , Freyr is presented as one of the Vanir , the son of the sea god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r , or Njord , as well as the twin brother of the goddess Freyja .

It was written in Old Norse in Iceland by the poet and historian Snorri Sturluson ( 1178/79-1241 ) c. 1230 . The name Heimskringla was first used in the 17th century , derived from the first two words of one of the manuscripts ( kringla heimsins , the circle of the world ) . Heimskringla is a collection of sagas about Swedish and Norwegian kings , beginning with the saga of the legendary Swedish dynasty of the Ynglings , followed by accounts of historical Norwegian rulers from Harald Fairhair of the 9th century up to the death of the pretender Eystein Meyla in 1177 . The exact sources of his work are disputed , but included earlier kings ' sagas , such as Morkinskinna , Fagrskinna and the twelfth century Norwegian synoptic histories and oral traditions , notably many skaldic poems . Snorri had himself visited Norway and Sweden . For events of the mid-12th century , Snorri explicitly names the now-lost work Hryggjarstykki as his source .

The narrative begins 24 years after the death of Fr\u00f3\u00f0i , and takes place in the 9th and the 10th centuries . It is a composite tale containing a story of how Freyja acquired a necklace from the Dwarves , how that led to a bloody war , and how Olaf Tryggvason brought peace to the land . The story parallels elements of earlier stories such as Heimskringla ( euhemerization of gods ) , parts of the poem Lokasenna ( Loki 's accusation of Gefjun sleeping with a boy for a necklace ) , parts of the H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa poem ( Loki stealing the necklace Br\u00edsingamen ) , and the eternal battle Hja\u00f0ningav\u00edg ( various earlier sources ) . In the end of the story , the arrival of Christianity dissolves the old curse that was traditionally to endure until Ragnar\u00f6k . The story has been described as post-classical due to elements such as the descriptor of Loki as cunning without apparent irony , featuring Freyja and Loki as court retainers , and the open representation of Freyja 's sexuality that it features . 19th century scholar Benjamin Thorpe referred to Freyja 's role in the tale as rather awkward .",

  "/wiki/Indo-European_languages": "The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects in Asia and Europe . There are about 445 living Indo-European languages , according to the estimate by Ethnologue , with over two thirds ( 313 ) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch . The Indo-European languages with the greatest numbers of native speakers are Spanish , English , Hindustani ( Hindi/Urdu ) , Portuguese , Bengali , Punjabi , and Russian , each with over 100 million speakers , with German , French , Marathi , Italian , and Persian also having more than 50 million . Today , 46% of the world 's population ( 3.2 billion ) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language , by far the highest of any language family . The Indo-European family includes most of the modern languages of Europe . The language family is also represented in Asia with the exception of East and Southeast Asia . It was prominent ( alongside non-Indo-European languages ) in ancient Anatolia ( present-day Turkey ) , the ancient Tarim Basin ( present-day Northwest China ) and most of Central Asia until the medieval Turkic and Mongol invasions . Outside Eurasia , Indo-European languages are dominant in the Americas and much of Oceania and Africa , having reached there through colonialism during the Age of Discovery and later periods . Indo-European languages are also most commonly present as minority languages or second languages in countries where other families are dominant . With written evidence appearing from the Bronze Age in the form of Mycenaean Greek and the Anatolian languages Hittite and Luwian , the Indo-European family is significant to the field of historical linguistics as possessing the second-longest recorded history , after the Afroasiatic family in the form of the Egyptian language and the Semitic languages of the Near East . In addition , certain extinct language isolates of the Near East and Anatolia , such as Sumerian , Elamite , Hurrian , Hattian , Gutian , and Kassite are also recorded earlier than any Indo-European tongue .

Norse mythology , the source of most surviving information about him , associates Odin with wisdom , healing , death , royalty , the gallows , knowledge , war , battle , victory , sorcery , poetry , frenzy , and the runic alphabet , and portrays him as the husband of the goddess Frigg . In wider Germanic mythology and paganism , the god was known in Old English as W\u014dden , in Old Saxon as W\u014ddan , in Old Dutch as Wuodanand in Old High German as Wuotan . Odin appears as a prominent god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples , from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania ( from c. 12 BCE ) through the tribal expansions of the Migration Period ( 4th to 6th centuries CE ) and the Viking Age ( 8th to 11th centuries CE ) . In the modern period the rural folklore of Germanic Europe continued to acknowledge Odin . References to him appear in place names throughout regions historically inhabited by the ancient Germanic peoples , and the day of the week Wednesday bears his name in many Germanic languages , including in English . In Old English texts , Odin holds a particular place as a euhemerized ancestral figure among royalty , and he is frequently referred to as a founding figure among various other Germanic peoples , such as the Langobards . Forms of his name appear frequently throughout the Germanic record , though narratives regarding Odin are mainly found in Old Norse works recorded in Iceland , primarily around the 13th century . These texts make up the bulk of modern understanding of Norse mythology . Old Norse texts portray Odin as one-eyed and long-bearded , frequently wielding a spear named Gungnir and wearing a cloak and a broad hat . He is often accompanied by his animal companions and familiars - the wolves Geri and Freki and the ravens Huginn and Muninn , who bring him information from all over Midgard - and rides the flying , eight-legged steed Sleipnir across the sky and into the underworld .

They are the only known examples of Germanic pagan belief preserved in the language . They were discovered in 1841 by Georg Waitz , who found them in a theological manuscript from Fulda , written in the 9th century , although there remains some speculation about the date of the charms themselves . The manuscript ( Cod . 136 f. 85a ) is stored in the library of the cathedral chapter of Merseburg , hence the name .",
  "/wiki/Gefjun": "In Norse mythology , Gefjon ( alternatively spelled Gefion or Gefjun ) is a goddess associated with ploughing , the Danish island of Zealand , the legendary Swedish king Gylfi , the legendary Danish king Skj\u00f6ldr , foreknowledge , and virginity . Gefjon is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources ; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson ; in the works of skalds ; and appears as a gloss for various Greco-Roman goddesses in some Old Norse translations of Latin works . The Prose Edda and Heimskringla both report that Gefjon plowed away what is now lake M\u00e4laren , Sweden , and with this land formed the island of Zealand , Denmark . In addition , the Prose Edda describes that not only is Gefjon a virgin herself , but that all who die a virgin become her attendants . Heimskringla records that Gefjon married the legendary Danish king Skj\u00f6ldr and that the two dwelled in Lejre , Denmark . Scholars have proposed theories about the etymology the name of the goddess , connections to fertility and ploughing practices , the implications of the references made to her as a virgin , five potential mentions of the goddess in the Old English poem Beowulf ( parallelled by mentions in the Old Saxon poem Heliand ) , and potential connections between Gefjon and Grendel 's Mother and/or the goddesses Freyja and Frigg .",

Since then the kings of Sweden were called Ynglings and those of Denmark Skj\u00f6ldungs . Scyld Scefing is the legendary ancestor of the Danish royal lineage known as the Scyldings . He is the counterpart of the Skioldus or Skj\u00f6ldr of Danish and Icelandic sources . He appears in the opening lines of Beowulf , where he is referred to as Scyld Scefing , implying he is a descendant of Sceafa , Scyld son of Scef , or Scyld of the Sheaf .

The entities are themselves ambiguously defined , variously referred to by several other terms , including risi , thurs and troll . Although the term giant is sometimes used to gloss the word j\u00f6tunn and its apparent synonyms in some translations and academic texts , j\u00f6tnar are not necessarily notably large and may be described as exceedingly beautiful or as alarmingly grotesque . Some deities , such as Ska\u00f0i and Ger\u00f0r , are themselves described as j\u00f6tnar , and various well-attested deities , such as Odin , are descendants of the j\u00f6tnar . Norse myth traces the origin of the j\u00f6tnar to the proto-being Ymir , a result of growth or asexual reproduction from the entity 's body . Ymir is later killed , his body dismembered to create the world , and the j\u00f6tnar survive this event by way of sailing through a flood of Ymir 's blood . The j\u00f6tnar dwell in J\u00f6tunheimr . In later Scandinavian folklore , the ambiguity surrounding the entities gives way to negative portrayals .",
  "/wiki/Ox": "An ox ( plural oxen ) , also known as a bullock in Australia and India , is a bovine trained as a draft animal . Oxen are commonly castrated adult male cattle ; castration makes the animals easier to control . Cows ( adult females ) or bulls ( intact males ) may also be used in some areas . Oxen are used for plowing , for transport ( pulling carts , hauling wagons and even riding ) , for threshing grain by trampling , and for powering machines that grind grain or supply irrigation among other purposes . Oxen may be also used to skid logs in forests , particularly in low-impact , select-cut logging . Oxen are usually yoked in pairs . Light work such as carting household items on good roads might require just one pair , while for heavier work , further pairs would be added as necessary . A team used for a heavy load over difficult ground might exceed nine or ten pairs .",

  "/wiki/Ilmr": "Ilmr is a figure in Norse mythology who is listed as a goddess and who occurs in skaldic kennings . Her associations and original nature are unknown . Ilmr is attested at two points in the so-called Nafna\u00feulur appended to the Prose Edda book Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l : between I\u00f0unn and Bil in a list of \u00e1synjur , and in a list of words that can be used in kennings for woman . No further information other than her name is provided . She is not mentioned in Eddic poetry , but her name does occur several times in skaldic poetry of the 10th and 11th centuries , particularly in verses by Korm\u00e1kr \u01eagmundarson . It is impossible to determine the associations of the goddess Ilmr . Jacob Grimm pointed out that while the goddess name Ilmr is feminine , the masculine word ilmr means pleasant scent ( suavis odor ) ; an association with scent would be unique among Norse deities . Korm\u00e1kr , at least , used valkyrie-names as well as goddess-names in forming kennings referring to women , and it is possible that he thought of Ilmr as a valkyrie ; one other kenning using her name , in a verse preserved in Landnamab\u00f3k and attributed to Hr\u00f3mundr halti , is of a type ( kennings for battle formed with a female name ) that is only attested with names of valkyries . In his 1989 etymological dictionary of Icelandic , \u00c1sgeir Bl\u00f6ndal Magn\u00fasson suggested that this might indicate the name Ilmr was related to the noun jalmr ( noise ) with which it is coupled in the kenning ; this is a known type of valkyrie-name . Eir , \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r , and the norn Skuld are other female figures variously identified as valkyries and goddesses within the Old Norse corpus . Alternatively , \u00c1sgeir Bl\u00f6ndal Magn\u00fasson suggests Ilmr is a tree d\u00eds , with a name etymologically related to almr , elm .

The saga deals with a process of blood feuds in the Icelandic Commonwealth , showing how the requirements of honor could lead to minor slights spiralling into destructive and prolonged bloodshed . Insults where a character 's manhood is called into question are especially prominent and may reflect an author critical of an overly restrictive ideal of masculinity . Another characteristic of the narrative is the presence of omens and prophetic dreams . It is disputed whether this reflects a fatalistic outlook on the part of the author . The principal characters in the saga are the friends Nj\u00e1ll \u00deorgeirsson , a lawyer and a sage , and Gunnar H\u00e1mundarson , a formidable warrior . Gunnar 's wife instigates a feud that leads to the death of many characters over several decades including the killing by fire of the eponymous Burnt Nj\u00e1ll . The work is anonymous , although there has been extensive speculation on the author 's identity . The major events described in the saga are probably historical but the material was shaped by the author , drawing on oral tradition , according to his artistic needs . Nj\u00e1ls saga is the longest and most highly developed of the sagas of Icelanders . It is often considered the peak of the saga tradition ."
