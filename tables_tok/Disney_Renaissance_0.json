  "intro": "The Disney Renaissance is the period from 1989 to 1999 during which Walt Disney Animation Studios returned to producing critically and commercially successful animated films that were mostly based on well-known stories, much as the studio did during the era of Walt Disney during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. The resurgence allowed Disney's animated films to become powerhouse successes at the domestic and foreign box office, making much more profit than most of the other Disney films of the past eras. The animated films released by Disney during this period include The Little Mermaid (1989), The Rescuers Down Under (1990), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Pocahontas (1995), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), Hercules (1997), Mulan (1998), and Tarzan (1999)."
