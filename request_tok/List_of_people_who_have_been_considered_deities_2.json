In Greco-Latin Ezra is called Esdras ( Greek : \u1f1c\u03c3\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 ) . According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Sraya ( Ezra 7:1 ) the last High Priest to serve in the First Temple ( 2 Kings 25:18 ) , and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the Second Temple ( Ezra 3:2 ) . He returned from Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem ( Ezra 7-10 and Neh 8 ) . According to 1 Esdras , a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy , he was also a High Priest . Rabbinic tradition holds that he was an ordinary member of the priesthood . Several traditions have developed over his place of burial . One tradition says that he is buried in al-Uzayr near Basra ( Iraq ) , while another tradition alleges that he is buried in Tadif near Aleppo , in northern Syria . His name may be an abbreviation of \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5 Azaryahu , Yah helps . In the Greek Septuagint the name is rendered \u00c9sdr\u0101s ( \u1f1c\u03c3\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 ) , from which the Latin name Esdras comes . The Book of Ezra describes how he led a group of Judean exiles living in Babylon to their home city of Jerusalem ( Ezra 8.2-14 ) where he is said to have enforced observance of the Torah . He was described as exhorting the Israelite people to be sure to follow the Torah Law so as not to intermarry with people of particular different religions , a set of commandments described in the Pentateuch .",

It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature . [ Note 4 ] [ Note 5 ] Slightly shorter than the New Testament , it is organized in 114 chapters ( Arabic : \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 s\u016brah , plural \u0633\u0648\u0631 suwar ) - not according to chronology or subject matter , but according to length of surahs ( with some exceptions ) .

Muslims believe that the Quran was orally revealed by God to the final prophet , Muhammad , through the archangel Gabriel ( Jibril ) , incrementally over a period of some 23 years , beginning on 22 December 609 CE , when Muhammad was 40 , and concluding in 632 , the year of his death . Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad 's most important miracle , a proof of his prophethood , and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to Adam , including the Tawrah ( Torah ) , the Zabur ( Psalms ) and the Injil ( Gospel ) , and ending with Muhammad 's revelation . The word Quran occurs some 70 times in the Quran 's text , and other names and words are also said to refer to the Quran . Unlike the Bible , it is thought by Muslims to be not simply divinely inspired , but the literal word of God . According to tradition , several of Muhammad 's companions served as scribes and recorded the revelations . Shortly after his death , the Quran was compiled by the companions , who had written down or memorized parts of it . The codices showed differences that motivated Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version , now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .",

The term may also refer to the descendants of the Yemenite Jewish community . Between June 1949 and September 1950 , the overwhelming majority of Yemen 's Jewish population was transported to Israel in Operation Magic Carpet . After several waves of persecution throughout Yemen , most Yemenite Jews now live in Israel , while smaller communities live in the United States and elsewhere . Only a handful remain in Yemen . The few remaining Jews experience intense , and at times violent , anti-Semitism on a daily basis . Yemenite Jews have a unique religious tradition that distinguishes them from Ashkenazi , Sephardi , and other Jewish groups . They have been described as the most Jewish of all Jews . Yemenite Jews are generally described as belonging to Mizrahi Jews , though they differ from the general trend of Mizrahi groups in Israel , which have undergone a process of total or partial assimilation to Sephardic culture and Sephardic liturgy . While the Shami sub-group of Yemenite Jews did adopt a Sephardic-influenced rite , this was in no small part due to it essentially being forced upon them , and did not reflect a demographic or cultural shift .",

Uzair is most often identified with the biblical Ezra . Modern historians have described the reference as enigmatic , since such views have not been found in Jewish sources . Islamic scholars have interpreted the Quranic reference in different ways , with some explaining that it alluded to a specific group of Jews . According to Ibn Kathir , Uzair lived between the times of King Solomon and the time of Zachariah , father of John the Baptist . Some Quranic commentators viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God . He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years ( 2:259 ) . Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr to be one of the prophets . However , Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar ( predestination ) . Ibn Hazm , al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair ( or one of his disciples ) falsified the Torah , and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible . Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra , an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers . Classical Muslim scholars who were aware of Jewish and Christian denials of belief in the sonship of Ezra , explained that it was only one Jew or a small group of Jews who worshipped Uzayr , or that the verse refers to the extreme admiration of Jews for their doctors of law .",

Seleucus received Babylonia ( 321 BC ) and from there expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander 's near-eastern territories . At the height of its power , the Empire included central Anatolia , Persia , the Levant , Mesopotamia , and what is now Kuwait , Afghanistan , and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan . The Seleucid Empire became a major center of Hellenistic culture - it maintained the preeminence of Greek customs where a Greek political elite dominated , mostly in the urban areas . The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by immigration from Greece . Seleucid attempts to defeat their old enemy Ptolemaic Egypt were frustrated by Roman demands . Having come into conflict in the east ( 305 BC ) with Chandragupta Maurya of the Maurya Empire , Seleucus I entered into an agreement with Chandragupta whereby he ceded vast territory west of the Indus , including the Hindu Kush , modern-day Afghanistan , and the Balochistan province of Pakistan and offered his daughter in marriage to the Maurya Emperor to formalize the alliance . Antiochus III the Great attempted to project Seleucid power and authority into Hellenistic Greece , but his attempts were thwarted by the Roman Republic and by Greek allies such as the Kingdom of Pergamon , culminating in a Seleucid defeat at the 190 BC Battle of Magnesia . In the subsequent Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC , the Seleucids were compelled to pay costly war reparations and relinquished claims to territories west of the Taurus Mountains . The Parthians under Mithridates I of Parthia conquered much of the remaining eastern part of the Seleucid Empire in the mid-2nd century BC , while the independent Greco-Bactrian Kingdom continued to flourish in the northeast .

Paul is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age and from the mid-30s to the mid-50s AD he founded several Christian communities in Asia Minor and Europe . He took advantage of his status as both a Jew and a Roman citizen to minister to both Jewish and Roman audiences . According to the New Testament book Acts of the Apostles ( often simply called Acts ) , Paul persecuted some of the early disciples of Jesus , possibly Hellenised diaspora Jews converted to Christianity , in the area of Jerusalem prior to his conversion .

According to Acts 4:36 , Barnabas was a Cypriot Jew . Named an apostle in Acts 14:14 , he and Paul the Apostle undertook missionary journeys together and defended Gentile converts against the Judaizers . They traveled together making more converts ( c. 45-47 ) , and participated in the Council of Jerusalem ( c. 50 ) . Barnabas and Paul successfully evangelized among the God-fearing Gentiles who attended synagogues in various Hellenized cities of Anatolia . Barnabas ' story appears in the Acts of the Apostles , and Paul mentions him in some of his epistles . Tertullian named him as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews , but this and other attributions are conjecture . Clement of Alexandria and some scholars have ascribed the Epistle of Barnabas to him , but his authorship is disputed .

Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up a two-part work , Luke-Acts , by the same anonymous author , usually dated to around 80-90 AD . The first part , the Gospel of Luke , tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world 's salvation through the life , death , and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth , the promised Messiah . Acts continues the story of Christianity in the 1st century , beginning with Jesus 's ascension to Heaven . The early chapters , set in Jerusalem , describe the Day of Pentecost ( the coming of the Holy Spirit ) and the growth of the church in Jerusalem . Initially , the Jews are receptive to the Christian message , but later they turn against the followers of Jesus . Rejected by the Jews , the message is taken to the Gentiles under the guidance of the Apostle Peter . The later chapters tell of Paul 's conversion , his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean , and finally his imprisonment in Rome , where , as the book ends , he awaits trial . Luke-Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem , namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church ; the answer it provides is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it . Luke-Acts can also be seen as a defense of ( or apology for ) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews : the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences , with the Romans serving as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law . On the one hand , Luke portrays the followers of Jesus as a sect of the Jews , and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion ; on the other , Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians , celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God 's promised Messiah .",

It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives .

He is able to move freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine , playing the role of the psychopomp or soul guide - a conductor of souls into the afterlife .

[ web 1 ] Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies . It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE , spreading through much of Asia . Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars : Theravada ( Pali : The School of the Elders ) and Mahayana ( Sanskrit : The Great Vehicle ) . Most Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth , either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood . Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation , the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts , and their specific teachings and practices . Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha , the Dharma and the Sangha , observance of moral precepts , monasticism , meditation , and the cultivation of the Paramitas ( perfections , or virtues ) . Theravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar and Thailand . Mahayana , which includes the traditions of Pure Land , Zen , Nichiren Buddhism , Shingon and Tiantai ( Tendai ) , is found throughout East Asia .

Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era , the term Hindu implied a geographic , ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu ( Indus ) river . By the 16th century , the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims . [ a ] [ b ] The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population , in a religious or cultural sense , is unclear . Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era , or that it may have developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars . A sense of Hindu identity and the term Hindu appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and Bengali . The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati , Kabir and Eknath used the phrase Hindu dharma ( Hinduism ) and contrasted it with Turaka dharma ( Islam ) . The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu ' in religious context in 1649 . In the 18th century , the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus , in contrast to Mohamedans for Mughals and Arabs following Islam . By the mid-19th century , colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists , Sikhs and Jains , but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term Hindu until about mid-20th century .",
  "/wiki/Durga": "Durga ( Sanskrit : \u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e , IAST : Durg\u0101 ) , identified as Adi Parashakti , is a principal and popular form of the Hindu Goddess . She is a goddess of war , the warrior form of Parvati , whose mythology centres around combating evils and demonic forces that threaten peace , prosperity , and Dharma the power of good over evil . Durga is also a fierce form of the protective mother goddess , who unleashes her divine wrath against the wicked for the liberation of the oppressed , and entails destruction to empower creation . Durga is depicted in the Hindu pantheon as a Goddess riding a lion or tiger , with many arms each carrying a weapon , often defeating Mahishasura ( lit . buffalo demon ) . The three principal forms of Durga worshiped are Maha Durga , Chandika and Aparajita . Of these , Chandika has two forms called Chandi who is of the combined power and form of Saraswati , Lakshmi and Parvati and of Chamunda who is a form of Kali created by the goddess for killing demons Chanda and Munda . Maha Durga has three forms : Ugrachanda , Bhadrakali and Katyayani . Bhadrakali Durga is also worshiped in the form of her nine epithets called Navadurga . She is a central deity in Shaktism tradition of Hinduism , where she is equated with the concept of ultimate reality called Brahman . One of the most important texts of Shaktism is Devi Mahatmya , also known as Durg\u0101 Saptashat\u012b or Chandi patha , which celebrates Durga as the goddess , declaring her as the supreme being and the creator of the universe . Estimated to have been composed between 400 and 600 CE , this text is considered by Shakta Hindus to be as important a scripture as the Bhagavad Gita .",
  "/wiki/Prepubescent": "Preadolescence , also known as pre-teen or tween , is a stage of human development following early childhood and preceding adolescence .

Preadolescence can bring its own challenges and anxieties .",
  "/wiki/Puberty": "Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child 's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction . It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads : the ovaries in a girl , the testes in a boy . In response to the signals , the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth , function , and transformation of the brain , bones , muscle , blood , skin , hair , breasts , and sex organs . Physical growth - height and weight - accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed . Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities , the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs . On average , girls begin puberty around ages 10-11 and end puberty around 15-17 ; boys begin around ages 11-12 and end around 16-17 . The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche , the onset of menstruation , which occurs on average between ages 12 and 13 . For males , first ejaculation occurs on average at age 13 . In the 21st century , the average age at which children , especially girls , reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century , when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys . This can be due to any number of factors , including improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth , increased weight and fat deposition , or exposure to endocrine disruptors such as xenoestrogens , which can at times be due to food consumption or other environmental factors . Puberty which starts earlier than usual is known as precocious puberty , and puberty which starts later than usual is known as delayed puberty . Notable among the morphologic changes in size , shape , composition , and functioning of the pubertal body , is the development of secondary sex characteristics , the filling in of the child 's body ; from girl to woman , from boy to man .",

  "/wiki/John_Nicholson_(general)": "Brigadier John Nicholson CB ( 11 December 1822 - 23 September 1857 ) was a British Victorian era military officer known for his role in British India . Born in Ireland , Nicholson moved to India at a young age and obtained a commission in the East India Company where he spent the majority of his life helping to expand British rule on the Company Raj 's periphery in numerous conflicts such as the First Anglo-Afghan War and the First and Second Anglo-Sikh War . Nicholson created a legend for himself as a political officer under Henry Lawrence in the frontier provinces of the British Empire , especially in the Punjab , and he was instrumental in the settlement of the North-West Frontier . Perhaps Nicholson 's most defining moment was his crucial role and death while suppressing the Indian Mutiny of 1857 which gained him adoration in Britain and infamy in India for his ruthlessness in crushing the rebellion . A charismatic and authoritarian figure , Nicholson 's life and controversial exploits have created a polarized legacy with contemporary descriptions of Nicholson ranging from him being the man who saved British rule in India to him being an imperial psychopath . However , Nicholson was certainly a man of his time whose stern but fair governance gained him both fear and respect in equal measure from the various groups of people who lived under his rule . His imposing physical appearance and noted deeds of valor and violence created an almost mythical status and even religious worship among the numerous tribes of the North-West Frontier whom Nicholson brought into the British Empire .",

In his early life he was groomed to be the new World Teacher but later rejected this mantle and withdrew from the Theosophy organization behind it . His interests included psychological revolution , the nature of mind , meditation , inquiry , human relationships , and bringing about radical change in society . He stressed the need for a revolution in the psyche of every human being and emphasised that such revolution can not be brought about by any external entity , be it religious , political , or social . Krishnamurti was born in India . In early adolescence he had a chance encounter with occultist and theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater on the grounds of the Theosophical Society headquarters at Adyar in Madras . He was subsequently raised under the tutelage of Annie Besant and Leadbeater , leaders of the Society at the time , who believed him to be a 'vehicle ' for an expected World Teacher . As a young man , he disavowed this idea and dissolved the Order of the Star in the East , an organisation that had been established to support it . Krishnamurti said he had no allegiance to any nationality , caste , religion , or philosophy , and spent the rest of his life travelling the world , speaking to large and small groups , as well as individuals . He wrote many books , among them The First and Last Freedom , The Only Revolution , and Krishnamurti 's Notebook . Many of his talks and discussions have been published .

He is a defining figure in modern Ethiopian history . He was a member of the Solomonic dynasty who traced his lineage to Emperor Menelik I. Selassie 's internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations . At the League of Nations in 1936 , he condemned Italy 's use of chemical weapons against its people during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War . He has been criticized by some historians for his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy ( the mesafint ) , which consistently opposed his reforms ; some critics have also criticized Ethiopia 's failure to modernize rapidly enough . During his rule the Harari people were persecuted and many left the Harari Region . His regime was also criticized by human rights groups , such as Human Rights Watch , as autocratic and illiberal . Among the Rastafari movement , whose followers are estimated to number between 700,000 and one million , Haile Selassie is revered as the returned messiah of the Bible , God incarnate .

It is classified as both a new religious movement and a social movement by scholars of religion . There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners , who are known as Rastafari , Rastafarians , or Rastas . Rasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the Bible . Central is a monotheistic belief in a single God - referred to as Jah - who partially resides within each individual . Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as Jesus Christ . Rastas accord Haile Selassie , the Emperor of Ethiopia between 1930 and 1974 , central importance ; many regard him as the Second Coming of Christ and thus Jah incarnate , while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual . Rastafari is Afrocentric and focuses attention on the African diaspora , which it believes is oppressed within Western society , or Babylon . Many Rastas call for this diaspora 's resettlement in Africa , a continent they consider the Promised Land of Zion . Some practitioners extend these views into black supremacism .

Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically , [ g ] although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus . [ h ] [ i ] Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry . He preached orally and was often referred to as rabbi .

After his death , his followers believed he rose from the dead , and the community they formed eventually became the early Church . Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit , was born of a virgin named Mary , performed miracles , founded the Christian Church , died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin , rose from the dead , and ascended into Heaven , from where he will return .

Its title is derived from the first word of the text , written in Koine Greek : apokalypsis , meaning unveiling or revelation ( before title pages and titles , books were commonly known by the incipit , their first words , as is also the case of the Hebrew Five Books of Moses or Torah ) . The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic document in the New Testament canon ( although there are short apocalyptic passages in various places in the Gospels and the Epistles ) . The only extended apocalyptic passage in the Old Testament is in the Book of Daniel . [ a ] Thus , it occupies a central place in Christian eschatology . The author names himself in the text as John , but his precise identity remains a point of academic debate .

Modern scholarship generally takes a different view , and many consider that nothing can be known about the author except that he was a Christian prophet . Some modern scholars characterise Revelation 's author as a putative figure whom they call John of Patmos . The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian ( AD 81-96 ) , and the evidence tends to confirm this .

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations .

This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder , and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health . The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care - adherents use dentists , optometrists , obstetricians , physicians for broken bones , and vaccination when required by law - but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine .

His parents were students of hers and his father was one of the original members of the Board of Directors of The Mother Church . Until 1991 , the book was repeatedly rejected for publication by the Christian Science Board of Directors because of the depiction of Eddy as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and equating her with Christ Jesus , a position which Eddy considered blasphemous .

Destiny 's publication caused divisions within the church , including several resignations of prominent church employees .

  "/wiki/Cargo_cult": "A cargo cult is a belief system among members of a relatively undeveloped society in which adherents practice superstitious rituals hoping to bring modern goods supplied by a more technologically advanced society . These cults , millenarian in nature , were first described in Melanesia in the wake of contact with more technologically advanced Western cultures . The name derives from the belief which began among Melanesians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that various ritualistic acts such as the building of an airplane runway will result in the appearance of material wealth , particularly highly desirable Western goods ( i.e. , cargo ) , via Western airplanes . Cargo cults often develop during a combination of crises . Under conditions of social stress , such a movement may form under the leadership of a charismatic figure . This leader may have a vision ( or myth-dream ) of the future , often linked to an ancestral efficacy ( mana ) thought to be recoverable by a return to traditional morality . This leader may characterize the present state as a dismantling of the old social order , meaning that social hierarchy and ego boundaries have been broken down . Contact with colonizing groups brought about a considerable transformation in the way indigenous peoples of Melanesia have thought about other societies . Early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that practitioners simply failed to understand technology , colonization , or capitalist reform ; in this model , cargo cults are a misunderstanding of the systems involved in resource distribution , and an attempt to acquire such goods in the wake of interrupted trade . However , many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new social relationships , with material relations being secondary . Since the late twentieth century , alternative theories have arisen . For example , some scholars , such as Kaplan and Lindstrom , focus on Europeans ' characterization of these movements as a fascination with manufactured goods and what such a focus says about Western commodity fetishism .",

Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 ( following the vacancy of the Portuguese throne , which lasted for sixty years , until 1640 , when the Portuguese monarchy was restored ) , Queir\u00f3s claimed the archipelago for Spain , as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies , and named it La Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo . In the 1880s , France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago , and in 1906 , they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through an Anglo-French condominium . An independence movement arose in the 1970s , and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980 . Since independence , the country has become a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations , Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the Pacific Islands Forum .",

He is considered one of the most influential Jewish leaders of the 20th century . As leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement , he took an insular Hasidic group that almost came to an end with the Holocaust and transformed it into one of the most influential movements in religious world Jewry , with an international network of over 3,000 educational and social centers . The institutions he established include kindergartens , schools , drug-rehabilitation centers , care-homes for the disabled and synagogues . Schneerson was known for his intelligence and strong memory . Many testimonies attribute the performance of miracles to Schneerson . Schneerson 's published teachings fill more than 300 volumes , and he is noted for his contributions to Jewish continuity and religious thought , as well as his wide-ranging contributions to traditional Torah scholarship . He is recognized as the pioneer of Jewish outreach . During his lifetime , many of his adherents believed that he was the Messiah . Schneerson 's own attitude to this subject and whether he explicitly encouraged this belief are debated among his followers and researchers alike . Many followers refused to accept the fact of his death after 1994 . Since his death , Chabad has been torn between Messianics who openly declare he is alive , and antis , who accept the fact of his death .",

  "/wiki/Maitreya": "Maitreya ( Sanskrit ) , Metteyya ( Pali ) , is regarded as a future Buddha of this world in Buddhist eschatology . In some Buddhist literature , such as the Amitabha Sutra and the Lotus Sutra , he is referred to as Ajita . According to Buddhist tradition , Maitreya is a bodhisattva who will appear on Earth in the future , achieve complete enlightenment , and teach the pure dharma . According to scriptures , Maitreya will be a successor to the present Buddha , Gautama Buddha ( also known as \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha ) . The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya refers to a time in the future when the dharma will have been forgotten by most on the terrestrial world . Maitreya has also been adopted for his millenarian role by many non-Buddhist religions in the past , such as the White Lotus , as well as by modern new religious movements , such as Yiguandao ."
