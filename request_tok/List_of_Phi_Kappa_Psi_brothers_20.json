  "/wiki/Skeleton_(sport)": "Skeleton is a winter sliding sport in which a person rides a small sled , known as a skeleton bobsled ( or -sleigh ) , down a frozen track while lying face down and head-first . The sport and the sled may have been named from the bony appearance of the sled . Unlike other sliding sports of bobsleigh and luge , the race always involves single riders . Like bobsleigh , but unlike luge , the race begins with a running start from the opening gate at the top of the course . The skeleton sled is thinner and heavier than the luge sled , and skeleton affords the rider more control , making it safer than luge . Skeleton is the slowest of the three sliding sports , as skeleton 's face-down , head-first riding position is less aerodynamic than luge 's face-up , feet-first ride . Previously , skeleton appeared in the Olympic program in St. Moritz , Switzerland , in 1928 and again in 1948 . It was added permanently to the Olympic program for the 2002 Winter Olympics , at which stage a women 's race was added . During elite racing the rider experiences accelerations up to 5 g and reaches speeds over 130 km/h ( 81 mph ) .",

The crew consists of four rowers , each having one oar . There are two rowers on the stroke side ( rower 's right hand side ) and two on the bow side ( rower 's lefthand side ) . There is no coxswain , but the rudder is controlled by one of the crew , normally with the rudder cable attached to the toe of one of their shoes which can pivot about the ball of the foot , moving the cable left or right . The steersman may row at bow , who has the best vision when looking over their shoulder , or on straighter courses stroke may steer , since they can point the stern of the boat at some landmark at the start of the course . The equivalent boat when it is steered by a coxswain is called a coxed four . Racing boats ( often called shells ) are long , narrow , and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to reduce drag to a minimum . Originally made from wood , shells are now typically made from a composite material , usually carbon fiber reinforced polymer , for strength and weight advantages . Fours have a fin near the stern , to help prevent roll and yaw and to help the rudder . The riggers are staggered alternately along the boat so that the forces apply asymmetrically to each side of the boat . If the boat is sculled by rowers , each with two oars , the combination is called a quad scull .",
