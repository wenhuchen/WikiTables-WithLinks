Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

On 30 September 2004 British Racing Drivers ' Club president Jackie Stewart announced that the British Grand Prix would not be included on the 2005 provisional race calendar and , if it were , would probably not occur at Silverstone .

However , the Donington Park leaseholders , Donington Ventures Leisure , ran into severe financial problems and went into administration , resulting in the BRDC signing a 17-year deal with Ecclestone to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone . The escalating costs of the British Grand Prix led to the BRDC triggering a break clause in their contract , meaning that the 2019 British Grand Prix , would be the last at the Silverstone Circuit .

With a permanent seating capacity of 257,325 , it is the highest-capacity sports venue in the world . Considered relatively flat by American standards , the track is a 2.5-mile-long ( 4.0 km ) rectangular oval with dimensions that have remained essentially unchanged since its construction . It has two 5\u20448-mile-long ( 1,000 m ) straightaways , four geometrically identical 1\u20444-mile ( 400 m ) turns , connected by two 1\u20448-mile ( 200 m ) short straightaways , termed short chutes , between turns 1 and 2 , and between turns 3 and 4 . A modern , FIA Grade One infield road course was completed in 2000 , incorporating part of the oval , including the main stretch and the southeast turn , measuring 2.605 miles ( 4.192 km ) . In 2008 , and again in 2014 , the road course layout was modified to accommodate motorcycle racing , as well as to improve competition . Altogether , the current grounds have expanded from an original 320 acres ( 1.3 km2 ) on which the speedway was first built to cover an area of over 559 acres ( 2.3 km2 ) . Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 , it is the only such site to be affiliated with automotive racing history .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

The circuit business is now owned by Jonathan Palmer 's MotorSport Vision organisation , and the surrounding Donington Park Estate , still owned by the Wheatcroft family , is currently under lease by MotorSport Vision until 2038 . Originally part of the Donington Hall estate , it was created as a racing circuit during the period between the First and Second World Wars when the German Silver Arrows were battling for the European Championship . Used as a military vehicle storage depot during the Second World War , it fell into disrepair until bought by local construction entrepreneur Tom Wheatcroft . Revived under his ownership in the 1970s , it hosted a single Formula One race , but became the favoured home of the British round of the MotoGP motorcycling championship . Leased by Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd in 2007 the hope that Formula One racing could return to the track , the incomplete venture failed to raise sufficient financial backing during the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis . DVLL consequently lost the rights to the British rounds of both Formula 1 and MotoGP , and in its bankruptcy returned the track to the Wheatcroft family in December 2009 . Under Wheatcroft 's ownership , the venue underwent significant work , with the track restored to use in 2010 , before major upgrades in the following five years . At the end of 2010 , it was announced that Donington would become home to an annual historic motorsport event , the Donington Historic Festival , with new events constantly being added . Since 2010 , significant investment across the venue has seen major improvements made to its infrastructure , while the circuit has become a regular fixture for top class motorcycling in the form of the Superbike World Championship . In January 2017 , the circuit business and a long term lease on the estate was purchased by MotorSport Vision , with the purchase cleared by authorities in August of the same year . Significant investment has seen facilities at the venue brought up to modern standards , with a new restaurant , toilet blocks , large new grandstand and new circuit offices , as well as other detail changes ."
