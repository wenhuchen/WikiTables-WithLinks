  "/wiki/American_bullfrog": "The American bullfrog ( Lithobates catesbeianus ) , often simply known as the bullfrog in Canada and the United States , is an amphibious frog , a member of the family Ranidae , or true frogs . This frog has an olive green back and sides blotched with brownish markings and a whitish belly spotted with yellow or grey . The upper lip is often bright green and males have yellow throats . It typically inhabits large , permanent water bodies , such as swamps , ponds , and lakes , though it can also reside along smaller creeks and streams where it is usually found along the water 's edge . Bullfrogs can also occasionally be found inhabiting urban areas near ditches and culverts . The male bullfrog defends a territory during the breeding season . His call is reminiscent of the roar of a bull , which gives the frog its common name . This frog is native to southern and eastern parts of the United States and Canada , but has been widely introduced across other parts of North , Central and South America , Western Europe , and parts of Asia , and in some areas is regarded as a pest and an invasive species . The bullfrog is harvested for use as food in North America and in several other countries into which it has been introduced . It is also cultured in controlled environments , though this is a difficult and not always successful undertaking . Some international trade in frog legs occurs for human consumption . Bullfrogs are often used in biology classes in schools for dissection and are sometimes kept as pets .",

  "/wiki/Paddlefish": "Paddlefish ( family Polyodontidae ) are basal Chondrostean ray-finned fish . They have been referred to as primitive fish because they have evolved with few morphological changes since the earliest fossil records of the Early Cretaceous , 120 to 125 million years ago . Polyodontids are almost exclusively North American and Chinese , both extant and in the fossil record There are six known species : four extinct species known only from fossil remains ( three from western North America , one from China ) , one extant species , the American paddlefish ( Polyodon spathula ) which is native to the Mississippi River basin in the U.S. , and the Chinese paddlefish ( Psephurus glades ) , reported as extinct in 2019 . The species was last sighted in 2003 in the Yangtze River Basin in China . Chinese paddlefish are also commonly referred to as Chinese swordfish , or elephant fish . The earliest known species is Protopsephurus from the Early Cretaceous ( Barremian ) of China . Paddlefish populations have declined dramatically throughout their historic range as a result of overfishing , pollution , and the encroachment of human development , including the construction of dams that have blocked their seasonal upward migration to ancestral spawning grounds . Other detrimental effects include alterations of rivers which have changed natural flows resulting in the loss of spawning habitat and nursery areas .",

The list also contains U.S. territory birds as designated by each territory 's legislature . The selection of state birds began in 1927 , when the legislatures for Alabama , Florida , Maine , Missouri , Oregon , Texas and Wyoming selected their state birds . The last state to choose its bird was Arizona in 1973 . Alaska , California , and South Dakota permit hunting of their state birds . Pennsylvania has adopted a state game bird but not a state bird , while Alabama , Georgia , Massachusetts , Missouri , Oklahoma , South Carolina , and Tennessee have designated an additional state game bird for the purpose of hunting . The northern cardinal is the state bird of seven states , followed by the western meadowlark as the state bird of six states . Several states have extinct official animals , such as state dinosaurs in addition to state insects , state butterflies , state mammals and state reptiles . The District of Columbia designated a district bird in 1938 . Each of the five inhabited territories of the United States has a designated territorial bird ( except for American Samoa ) .",

  "/wiki/Square_dance": "A square dance is a dance for four couples ( eight dancers in total ) arranged in a square , with one couple on each side , facing the middle of the square . Square dances were first documented in 16th-century England but were also quite common in France and throughout Europe . They came to North America with the European settlers and have undergone considerable development there . In some countries and regions , through preservation and repetition , square dances have attained the status of a folk dance . The Western American square dance may be the most widely known form worldwide , possibly due to its association in the 20th century with the romanticized image of the American cowboy . Square dancing is , therefore , strongly associated with the United States . Nineteen U.S. states have designated it as their official state dance . The various square dance movements are based on the steps and figures used in traditional folk dances and social dances from many countries . Some of these traditional dances include English country dance , Caledonians and the quadrille . In most American forms of square dance , the dancers are prompted or cued through a sequence of steps ( square dance choreography ) by a caller to the beat ( and , in some traditions , the phrasing ) of music . In some forms of traditional square dancing , the caller may be one of the dancers or musicians , but in modern Western square dancing the caller will be on stage , giving full attention to directing the dancers . Modern Western square dances are not learned as complete routines ; the dancers learn basic movements , each with its own distinctive call , but do not know in what order they will be called .",

  "/wiki/Crinoid": "Crinoids are marine animals that make up the class Crinoidea , one of the classes of the phylum Echinodermata , which also includes the starfish , brittle stars , sea urchins and sea cucumbers . Those crinoids which , in their adult form , are attached to the sea bottom by a stalk are commonly called sea lilies , while the unstalked forms are called feather stars or comatulids , being members of the largest crinoid order , Comatulida . Adult crinoids are characterised by having the mouth located on the upper surface . This is surrounded by feeding arms , and is linked to a U-shaped gut , with the anus being located on the oral disc near the mouth . Although the basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognised , in most crinoids the five arms are subdivided into ten or more . These have feathery pinnules and are spread wide to gather planktonic particles from the water . At some stage in their life , most crinoids have a stem used to attach themselves to the substrate , but many live attached only as juveniles and become free-swimming as adults . There are only about 600 living species of crinoid , but the class was much more abundant and diverse in the past . Some thick limestone beds dating to the mid- to late-Paleozoic era are almost entirely made up of disarticulated crinoid fragments .",
  "/wiki/Northern_Bobwhite": "The northern bobwhite , Virginia quail or ( in its home range ) bobwhite quail ( Colinus virginianus ) is a ground-dwelling bird native to Canada , the United States , Mexico , and the Caribbean . It is a member of the group of species known as New World quails ( Odontophoridae ) . They were initially placed with the Old World quails in the pheasant family ( Phasianidae ) , but are not particularly closely related . The name bobwhite derives from its characteristic whistling call . Despite its secretive nature , the northern bobwhite is one of the most familiar quails in eastern North America because it is frequently the only quail in its range . Habitat degradation has likely contributed to the northern bobwhite population in eastern North America declining by roughly 85% from 1966-2014 . This population decline is apparently range-wide and continuing . There are 23 subspecies of northern bobwhite , many of which are hunted extensively as game birds . One subspecies , the masked bobwhite ( Colinus virginianus ridgwayi ) , is listed as endangered with wild populations located in the northern Mexican state of Sonora and a reintroduced population in Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in southern Arizona .",

Strong evidence indicates that Dr. Daniel Norton first purveyed the Norton cultivar during the early 19th century from his vineyards in Virginia , USA . Further evidence has been reported that Dr. Norton developed the cultivar from seeds from a now extinct variety with unconfirmed parentage , Bland , pollinated by a Vitis Aestivalis grapevine . In 2009 , Riedel designed stemware specifically for wine made from the Norton grape . The glass was unveiled at Les Bourgeois Winery near Columbia , Missouri .",

The Stanley Cup , the oldest professional sports trophy in North America , is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season . The National Hockey League was organized on November 26 , 1917 , at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew , Ontario . The NHL immediately took the NHA 's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926 . At its inception , the NHL had four teams - all in Canada , thus the adjective National in the league 's name . The league expanded to the United States in 1924 , when the Boston Bruins joined , and has since consisted of American and Canadian teams . From 1942 to 1967 , the league had only six teams , collectively ( if not contemporaneously ) nicknamed the Original Six . The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL expansion . The league then increased to 18 teams by 1974 and 21 teams in 1979 . Between 1991 and 2000 , the NHL further expanded to 30 teams .

The inspiration for the day came from native Missourian and schoolteacher Anna Lee Brosius Korn . Having composed the former state song , Missouri , she felt the state needed an entire day to recognize significant Missourians . Korn later , after moving to Oklahoma , founded Oklahoma Day as well as the Oklahoma Hall of Fame . Though an established day , little observance is carried out in the state .

  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_horse_breeds": "Twelve U.S. states have designated a horse breed as the official state horse . The first state horse was designated in Vermont in 1961 . The most recent state designations occurred in 2010 , when North Carolina and South Carolina both declared state breeds . There have been proposals to designate a state horse in Oregon as well as in Arizona ( where an ongoing campaign sought to designate the Colonial Spanish Horse as the state horse prior to the state centennial in 2012 ) , but neither proposal is yet successful . In one state , North Dakota , the state horse is officially designated the honorary state equine . Two additional states have not designated a specific state horse , but have designed a horse or horse breed as its official state animals : the horse in New Jersey and the Morgan horse breed in Vermont . Some breeds , such as the American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan horse in Vermont and Massachusetts , were named as the state horse because of the close connection between the history of the breed and the state . Others , including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter , include the state in the official breed name . School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses , such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks , while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries . Official state horses are one of many state symbols officially designated by states .

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet . Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome , known as Latium . Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy , and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire . Latin has contributed many words to the English language . In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved . Latin was used as the language of international communication , scholarship and science until well into the 18th century , when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars ( including the Romance languages ) ."
