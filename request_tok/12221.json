A London-educated samurai of the Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain and leader of the early Meiji Restoration government , he chaired the bureau which drafted the Meiji Constitution in the 1880s . Looking to the West for inspiration , It\u014d rejected the United States Constitution as too liberal and the Spanish Restoration as too despotic before ultimately drawing on the British and German models , particularly the Prussian Constitution of 1850 . Dissatisfied with the prominent role of Christianity in European legal traditions , he substituted references to the more traditionally Japanese concept of kokutai or national polity , which became the constitutional justification for imperial authority . In 1885 , he became Japan 's first Prime Minister , an office his constitutional bureau had introduced . He went on to hold the position four times , becoming one of the longest serving PMs in Japanese history , and wielded considerable power even out of office as a member of Japan 's genr\u014d and occasional President of the Emperor 's Privy Council . A monarchist , It\u014d favoured a large , bureaucratic government and opposed the formation of political parties . His third term in government was ended by the consolidation of the opposition into the Kenseit\u014d party in 1898 , prompting him to found the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai party in response . He resigned his fourth and final ministry in 1901 after growing weary of party politics . It\u014d 's foreign policy was ambitious . He strengthened diplomatic ties with Western powers including Germany , the United States and especially the United Kingdom . In Asia he oversaw the First Sino-Japanese War and negotiated Chinese surrender on terms aggressively favourable to Japan , including the annexation of Taiwan and the release of Korea from the Chinese Imperial tribute system .",

  "/wiki/Han_school": "The han school ( \u85e9\u6821 , hank\u014d ) was an educational institution in the Edo period of Japan , originally established to educate children of daimy\u014ds ( feudal lords ) and their retainers in the domains outside of the capital . These institutions were also known as hangaku ( \u85e9\u5b66 ) , hangakk\u014d ( \u85e9\u5b66\u6821 ) or hank\u014d ( \u85e9\u9ecc ) . These schools existed until 1871 , when the domains were abolished after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 . The han schools were at first narrowly defined as schools of Confucian studies for the cultivation of the samurai elite , and attendance was both expected of and limited to the children of this class . Late in the period , however , children of other social classes were permitted to attend , and the curriculum was expanded from its core in the Confucian classics to include training in classical Japanese studies ( kokugaku ) , medicine , and the various branches of Western learning , including mathematics , astronomy , military science , and ballistics . Students entered at age 7 or 8 and usually completed their courses of study between the ages of 15 and 20 . By the 1860s there were about 255 han schools nationwide . The han schools , which predominated in provincial regions , were similar to and paralleled the terakoya or temple-school system of education which was more prominent in the major urban centers of the capital , Edo , and Osaka and Kyoto . The major difference between two systems was that hanko were state institutions organized by the local domain government , and terakoya were private institutions organized by local Buddhist temples . Some of the more famous han schools included Nisshinkan ( Aizu ) , K\u014dd\u014dkan ( Mito ) , Meirind\u014d ( Sendai ) , Meirinkan ( Hagi , Yamaguchi ) and Jish\u016bkan ( Kumamoto ) .",

The name k\u014dgoishi means stones of divine protection , a name given them by the Meiji period archaeologist Tsuboi Sh\u014dgor\u014d , who conjectured that they served as spiritual or practical protection for sacred sites . K\u014dgoishi date to the 6th or 7th century CE , and are found predominantly in northern Ky\u016bsh\u016b and on the shores of the Inland Sea . The longest one to be found , at 2.3 km in length , lies near the summit of Mount K\u014dra ( ja : \u9ad8\u826f\u5c71 ) , near Fukuoka . The stones there are roughly one meter long , 50 cm high and 70 cm thick . Scholars after Tsuboi determined that the structures are most likely the remains of practical , military fortifications , and were unlikely to have significant spiritual connections . The style and form of the ruins matches many in Korea ; the period when these were built was one of flourishing contact with Korea , and it is theorized that Korean stoneworkers , artisans , and architects may have played a role in the construction of these fortresses . Many scholars believe that some k\u014dgoishi were built in anticipation of an attack from Korea .",
