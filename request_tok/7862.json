  "/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)": "A cartridge or a round is a type of pre-assembled firearm ammunition packaging a projectile ( bullet , shot , or slug ) , a propellant substance ( usually either smokeless powder or black powder ) and an ignition device ( primer ) within a metallic , paper or plastic case that is precisely made to fit within the barrel chamber of a breechloading gun , for the practical purpose of convenient transportation and handling during shooting . Although in popular usage the term bullet is often used to refer to a complete cartridge , it is correctly used only to refer to the projectile . Cartridges can be categorized by the type of their primers - a small charge of an impact- or electric-sensitive chemical mixture that is located at the center of the case head ( centerfire ) , inside the rim of the case base ( rimfire and the cupfire , now obsolete ) , in a sideway projection that is shaped like a pin ( pinfire , now obsolete ) or a lip ( lipfire , now obsolete ) , or in a small nipple-like bulge at the case base ( teat-fire , now obsolete ) . Military and commercial producers continue to pursue the goal of caseless ammunition . Some artillery ammunition uses the same cartridge concept as found in small arms . In other cases , the artillery shell is separate from the propellant charge . A cartridge without a projectile is called a blank . One that is completely inert ( contains no active primer and no propellant ) is called a dummy . One that failed to ignite and shoot off the projectile is called a dud , and one that ignited but failed to sufficiently push the projectile out of the barrel is called a squib .",

During World War II , production was decentralized to Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4nkangas depot and SOK-owned factories in Vaajakoski . After the war in 1946 , VKT was consolidated into the government-owned Valtion metallitehtaat conglomerate that became Valmet in 1951 and the unit was named just Tourula factory . The factory still produced sport and hunting rifles , but the main focus shifted to building industrial machines and tractors . Finally , Valmet 's Tourula factory was merged with SAKO to form Sako-Valmet Oy in 1986 . Production in Tourula ended in the late 1990s .",

  "/wiki/Beretta_AS70/90": "The Beretta AS70/90 was a light machine gun or squad automatic weapon derived from the Beretta AR70/90 rifle system . It used the same gas operated , rotating bolt system as the rifle but fired from an open bolt and had a much heavier fixed barrel . There were some minor cosmetic changes from the rifle , including a beefier front hand grip and enlarged handguards around the barrel . The stock was modified slightly to support the shooters shoulder and provides a grip for the support hand . The carrying handle was removable and its mounting can be used for a variety of optics . The AS70/90 light machine gun had been introduced by Beretta as a response to the requests of the Italian Army , which by the time ( late 1980s ) was looking for a more compact and handy squad automatic weapon to replace in this role the MG-42/59 ( Italian license-made version of the German Rheinmetall MG3 machine-gun ) . The AS70/90 anyway never passed well the extremely stringent trial tests it underwent by the Alpini troops of the Italian Army . The open bolt working system made this gun more sensitive to the penetration of dirt and other elements which caused frequent jamming and malfunctions . Furthermore , the AS70/90 fed only by STANAG magazines ; and although this includes the possibility of using the high-capacity ( 100-rounds ) Beta C-Mag , this was still too little for the necessity of the Italian Armed Forces , who basically wanted a belt-fed weapon with magazine-feeding possibility as an emergency optional . As a result , the AS70/90 was discarded , the FN MINIMI light machine-gun being adopted instead ( and being since manufactured under license in Italy by Beretta ) . The AS70/90 never interested any other customer , and quickly went out of the Beretta Defence/Police catalogues .

The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

It was invented in 1934 to create a cartridge like the German 13.2mm TuF anti-tank rifle round and the American .50 Browning Machine Gun round . It is used in the same roles as the NATO .50 BMG ( 12.7\u00d799mm NATO ) cartridge . The two differ in bullet shape and weight , and the casing of the 12.7\u00d7108mm is slightly longer , and its larger case capacity allow it to hold slightly more of a different type of powder . The 12.7\u00d7108mm can be used to engage a wide variety of targets on the battlefield , and will destroy unarmored vehicles , penetrate lightly armored vehicles and damage external ancillary equipment ( i.e . : searchlights , radar , transmitters , vision blocks , engine compartment covers ) on heavily armored vehicles such as tanks . It will also ignite gasoline and - since 2019 - diesel fuel . Armor-piercing ammunition will penetrate around 25 mm of armor . Normal full metal jacket ammunition will only dimple tank armor , causing no damage .",
  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

  "/wiki/German_Empire": "The German Empire ( German : Deutsches Kaiserreich , officially Deutsches Reich ) , sometimes referred to as Imperial Germany , was the German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 . It was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states , except for Austria , joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I , King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern . Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million . A heavily rural collection of states in 1815 , the now united Germany became predominantly urban . During its 47 years of existence , the German Empire was an industrial , technological , and scientific giant , gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country .",

  "/wiki/Besal": "The Besal , properly named Gun , Light , Machine , Faulkner , .303-inch , was a light machine gun of British origin . The weapon was intended as an alternative to the Bren gun as it was lighter , simpler , cheaper and easier to manufacture and therefore was not dependent on the Royal Small Arms Factory , Enfield which was within range of German bombers . As the threat to the supply of Brens receded , it was eventually deemed unnecessary and never went into mass production .

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy": "The Kingdom of Italy ( Italian : Regno d'Italia ) was a state which existed from 1861 - when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy - until 1946 - when civil discontent led an institutional referendum to abandon the monarchy and form the modern Italian Republic . The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia , which can be considered its legal predecessor state . Italy declared war on Austria in alliance with Prussia in 1866 and received the region of Veneto following their victory . Italian troops entered Rome in 1870 , thereby ending more than one thousand years of Papal temporal power . Italy entered into a Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882 , following strong disagreements with France about the respective colonial expansions . However , even if relations with Berlin became very friendly , the alliance with Vienna remained purely formal as the Italians were keen to acquire Trentino and Trieste , corners of Austria-Hungary populated by Italians . So during World War I , Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allied Powers , as the western powers promised territorial compensation ( at the expense of Austria-Hungary ) for participation that was more generous than Vienna 's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality . Victory in the war gave Italy a permanent seat in the Council of the League of Nations . Fascist Italy is the era of National Fascist Party government from 1922 to 1943 with Benito Mussolini as head of government . The fascists imposed totalitarian rule and crushed the political and intellectual opposition , while promoting economic modernization , traditional social values and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church . According to Payne ( 1996 ) , [ the ] Fascist government passed through several relatively distinct phases . The first phase ( 1923-1925 ) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system , albeit with a legally-organized executive dictatorship .",

The Bren was a licensed version of the Czechoslovak ZGB 33 light machine gun which , in turn , was a modified version of the ZB vz . 26 , which British Army officials had tested during a firearms service competition in the 1930s . The later Bren featured a distinctive top-mounted curved box magazine , conical flash hider , and quick change barrel .
