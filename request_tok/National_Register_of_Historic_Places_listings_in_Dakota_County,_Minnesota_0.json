The abundance of North American timber and the carpenter-built vernacular architectures based upon it made a picturesque improvisation upon Gothic a natural evolution . Carpenter Gothic improvises upon features that were carved in stone in authentic Gothic architecture , whether original or in more scholarly revival styles ; however , in the absence of the restraining influence of genuine Gothic structures , the style was freed to improvise and emphasize charm and quaintness rather than fidelity to received models .

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment , a philosophy he called organic architecture . This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater ( 1935 ) , which has been called the best all-time work of American architecture . As a founder of organic architecture , Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century , influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works . Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture , and he also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City , his unique vision for urban planning in the United States . In addition to his houses , Wright designed original and innovative offices , churches , schools , skyscrapers , hotels , museums , and other structures . He often designed interior elements for these buildings , as well , including furniture and stained glass . Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe . Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as the greatest American architect of all time . In 2019 , a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright .

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

The movement is generally considered part of the late Victorian period in terms of broad antique furniture designations . In architecture the Eastlake Style or Eastlake architecture is part of the Queen Anne style of Victorian architecture . Eastlake 's book Hints on Household Taste in Furniture , Upholstery , and Other Details posited that furniture and decor in people 's homes should be made by hand or machine workers who took personal pride in their work . Manufacturers in the United States used the drawings and ideas in the book to create mass-produced Eastlake Style or Cottage furniture . The geometric ornaments , spindles , low relief carvings , and incised lines were designed to be affordable and easy to clean ; nevertheless , many of the designs which resulted are artistically complex ."
