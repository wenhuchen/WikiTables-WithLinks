  "intro": "The U.S. state of Colorado is divided into 64 counties. Counties are important units of government in Colorado since there are no townships or other minor civil divisions. Two of these counties, Broomfield and Denver, have consolidated city and county governments. Colorado's ISO 3166-2:US state code is CO and its ANSI INCITS 38:2009 state code is 08. When the Colorado Territory first began creating counties in 1861, 17 counties (Summit, Larimer, Weld, Boulder, Gilpin, Clear Creek, Jefferson, Arapahoe, Douglas, Lake, Conejos, Costilla, Park, Fremont, El Paso, Pueblo, and Huerfano) and a Cheyenne Reserve were formed. In February 1866, the first new county, Las Animas, was created, followed by Saguache in December of that year. Bent County was created in February 1870, followed by Greenwood the following month. On February 2, 1874, Grand County and Elbert County were formed, and on February 10, La Plata, Hinsdale, and Rio Grande counties were created. Greenwood was absorbed into Bent on February 5. The last county to be created under the Colorado Territory name was San Juan County, created three months before statehood. By the time Colorado became a state on August 1, 1876, it had only 26 counties. In January 1877, Routt and Ouray were formed, followed by Gunnison and Custer counties in March."
