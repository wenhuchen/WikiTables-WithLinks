  "/wiki/Vulnerable_species": "A vulnerable species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as likely to become endangered unless the circumstances that are threatening its survival and reproduction improve . Vulnerability is mainly caused by habitat loss or destruction of the species home . Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened . Some species listed as vulnerable may be common in captivity , an example being the military macaw . There are currently 5196 animals and 6789 plants classified as vulnerable , compared with 1998 levels of 2815 and 3222 , respectively .

Major was born in Glasgow and studied at Basel and Zurich Universities in Switzerland and later G\u00f6ttingen in Germany . He graduated in medicine at Basel in 1868 and became a physician in Florence , Italy . Like many early naturalists he spent his free time studying fossil mammals . His first publication was on fossil primates in 1872 . The Italian government supported him in 1877 and he collected fossils from Calabria , Corsica , Sardinia , and Sicily . In 1886 , he stopped practising as a physician and began to study fossils in the Greek Archipelago with his collections going to the College Galliard at Lausanne and to the British Museum ( Natural History ) . In the British Museum collections he took a keen interest in material from Madagascar . He studied the lemur fauna , both extant and extinct , discovered the new family Megaladapidae ( Major 1893 ) , genus and species of the extinct giant lemur Megaladapis madagascariensis ( Major 1893 ) , and five new species in the genera Lepilemur and Cheirogaleus . This led to a keen interest in Madagascar and initiated an expedition to it . His field trip was funded by The Royal Society along with funds from Lionel Walter Rothschild , F. DuCane Godman , Sir Henry Peek and himself . The expedition started from Britain on 15 July 1894 and returned on 30 August 1896 .",

Described in 1894 , it was considered either a subspecies or taxonomic synonym of the weasel sportive lemur ( Lepilemur mustelinus ) throughout most of the 20th century .

It is relatively large for a sportive lemur , and is difficult to visually distinguish from the weasel sportive lemur .

  "/wiki/Red-tailed_sportive_lemur": "The red-tailed sportive lemur ( Lepilemur ruficaudatus ) , or red-tailed weasel lemur , is native to Madagascar like all lemurs . It is a nocturnal species feeding largely on leaves , though they also eat some fruit . Individuals weigh around 800 g ( 1.8 lb ) , and there is little sexual dimorphism . In general they live in mated pairs , with a home range of about 10,000 square metres . Both members of the pair use the same home range , and there is little overlap between the home ranges of neighbouring pairs . Travel distances each night are between 100 m ( 330 ft ) and 1 km ( 0.6 mi ) , making this a relatively inactive species . This species can be found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests . Red-tailed Sportive Lemurs travel in this pairs because it can be difficult for a male to produce roaming strategies and move farther away from the homeland . Therefore , they typically pair up with only one female for reproduction , hence their partner . Additionally , these Lemurs dont typically have a strong early warning system , making it difficult for them to warm others or send a signal . Instead , they have grown to develop strong escape mechanisms for them to flee danger . Many studies and experiments have been conducted to produce this information .",

From a very wealthy family , at the age of 20 , he and his brother , Ernest Grandidier ( 1833-1912 ) , undertook a voyage around the world . At first they were led by the astronomer and physicist Pierre Jules C\u00e9sar Janssen ( 1824-1907 ) , but when Janssen fell sick and had to return to France after about six months , the brothers continued the journey . They visited South America in 1858 and 1859 and in particular the Andes , Peru , Chile , Bolivia , Argentina and Brazil . During this voyage they gathered a significant collection of specimens which were analyzed , in 1860 , by Ernest . The two brothers parted ways after this . Ernest Grandidier went to China and collected a vast number of specimens which are now in the Louvre and the Guimet museum . Alfred travelled to India , reaching it in 1863 . He had intended to explore the high plateau of Tibet , but was prevented by a severe attack of fever . Grandidier travelled to Zanzibar to recuperate , remaining some time and making important collections and publishing an account of his findings . He then visited the island of R\u00e9union and in 1865 made his first visit to Madagascar . He became devoted to the study of the island , revisiting in 1866 and 1868 ."
