  "/wiki/New_Zealand_Railways_Corporation": "New Zealand Railways Corporation ( NZRC ) is the state-owned enterprise that owns the land beneath KiwiRail 's railway network on behalf of the Crown . The Corporation has existed under a number of guises since 1982 , when the old New Zealand Railways Department was corporatised followed by deregulation of the land transport sector . In 1986 , the Corporation became a State-owned enterprise , required to make a profit . Huge job losses and cut backs ensued , and the rail network , rail operations and ferry service of the Corporation were transferred to New Zealand Rail Limited in 1990 . The Corporation retained ownership of the land beneath the railway network , and charged a nominal rental to New Zealand Rail , which was privatised in 1993 , and renamed Tranz Rail in 1995 . In 2004 , following a deal with Tranz Rail 's new owners Toll NZ , the Corporation took over responsibility for maintaining and upgrading the rail network once more , trading under the name ONTRACK . However negotiations with Toll over track access charges concluded after four years with no agreement reached , so the government purchased the entire rail and ferry operations , naming the service KiwiRail . ONTRACK 's railway infrastructure and employees were then transferred to KiwiRail in 2008 , which itself was initially a subsidiary of the Corporation . However , on 31 December 2012 the Corporation once again became the land owner .",

This line was opened to Parnassus in 1912 and was known as the Parnassus Branch at that stage . However , the decision was made to use the Parnassus route as the main line , relegating the route from Waipara through the Weka Pass to Waiau to the status of branch line .
