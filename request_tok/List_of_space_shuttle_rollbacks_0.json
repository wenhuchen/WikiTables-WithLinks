  "/wiki/Hydrogen": "Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1 . With a standard atomic weight of 1.008 , hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic table . Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe , constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass . [ note 1 ] Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state . The most common isotope of hydrogen , termed protium ( name rarely used , symbol 1H ) , has one proton and no neutrons . The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch ( Big Bang ) . At standard temperature and pressure , hydrogen is a colorless , odorless , tasteless , non-toxic , nonmetallic , highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2 . Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements , most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds . Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules . In ionic compounds , hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge ( i.e. , anion ) when it is known as a hydride , or as a positively charged ( i.e. , cation ) species denoted by the symbol H+ . The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton , but in reality , hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex . As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically , study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics .",

  "/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Klaus": "Hurricane Klaus was a minimal Atlantic hurricane that dropped heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles in October 1990 . The eleventh tropical cyclone and sixth hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season , Klaus developed from a tropical wave on October 3 a short distance east of Dominica . It drifted northwestward , and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on October 5 . Though its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles was within 12 miles ( 19 km ) , the strongest winds remained to its northeast due to strong wind shear , which caused Klaus to steadily weaken . After deteriorating into a tropical depression , Klaus briefly restrengthened over the Bahamas before dissipating on October 9 under the influence of developing tropical storm , Marco . Heavy rainfall on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop . Damage was heaviest on Martinique , where seven casualties occurred and 1,500 people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island , resulting in some landslides . The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States , dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties ; the same area was affected with more precipitation a few days later by Tropical Storm Marco . Due to the damage caused by the storm , the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names .",

The fifth tropical cyclone , fifth named storm , and second hurricane of the unusually active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season , Erin developed from a tropical wave near the southeastern Bahamas on July 31 . Moving northwestward , the cyclone intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale near Rum Cay about 24 hours later . After a brief jog to the north-northwest on August 1 , Erin began moving to the west-northwest . The cyclone then moved over the northwestern Bahamas , including the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama . Early on August 2 , Erin made landfall near Vero Beach , Florida , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km/h ) . The hurricane weakened while crossing the Florida peninsula and fell to tropical storm intensity before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico later that day . Early on August 3 , Erin re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane . Strengthening further , the cyclone very briefly strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane , peaking with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 155 km/h ) as the eyewall moved ashore at Fort Walton Beach , Florida . Erin then weakened slightly to a Category 1 hurricane while brushing the coast of the Florida Panhandle , before making landfall at Pensacola Beach later on August 3 with winds 85 mph ( 140 km/h ) . After moving inland , the system quickly weakened to a tropical storm over Mississippi early on August 4 and then to a tropical depression several hours later .

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Bertha_(1996)": "Hurricane Bertha was an intense and early-forming major hurricane that affected areas from the Leeward Islands to the United States in July of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season . The second named storm , first hurricane , and first major hurricane during the season . Bertha originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa in early July . Steadily organizing while moving generally towards the west , the disturbance was designated as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on July 5 , and was further upgraded to a tropical storm by 1200 UTC later that day . Over the next few days , continued intensification occurred , and Bertha became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale , the first hurricane of the season , prior to moving through the northern Leeward Islands . Late on July 8 , a period of rapid intensification began , and at 0600 UTC on July 9 , Bertha reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph ( 185 km/h ) with a minimum barometric pressure of 960 mbar ( 28 inHg ) . Moving around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge , Bertha passed north of the Bahamas as a weakening hurricane before turning towards the north-northeast and undergoing another period of rapid intensification . Late on July 12 , Bertha made landfall between Wrightsville Beach and Topsail Beach , North Carolina with winds of 90 mph ( 140 km/h ) . Gradual weakening ensued the following day as Bertha moved up the Mid-Atlantic and into New England before becoming an extratropical cyclone on July 14 . As Bertha passed through the northern Leeward Islands , it caused moderate to severe damage . In the United States Virgin Islands , heavy rainfall , hurricane-force winds , and significant property damage was reported . In addition , many boats were destroyed , and total damage was estimated near $ 7.5 million ( 1996 USD ) .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Fran": "Hurricane Fran caused extensive damage in the United States in early September 1996 . The sixth named storm , fifth hurricane , and fourth major hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season , Fran developed from a tropical wave near Cape Verde on August 23 . Due to nearby Hurricane Edouard , the depression remained disorganized as it tracked westward , though it eventually intensified into Tropical Storm Fran on August 27 . While heading west-northwestward , Fran steadily strengthened into a hurricane on August 29 , but weakened back to a tropical storm on the following day . On August 31 , Fran quickly re-intensified into a hurricane . By September 2 , Fran began to parallel the islands of the Bahamas and slowly curved north-northwestward . Fran peaked as a 120 mph ( 195 km/h ) Category 3 hurricane by early on September 5 . Thereafter , Fran weakened slightly , before it made landfall near Cape Fear , North Carolina early on September 6 . The storm rapidly weakened inland and was only a tropical depression later that day . Eventually , Fran curved east-northeastward and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Ontario early on September 9 . In Florida , high tides capsized a boat with five people aboard , though all were rescued . No significant effects were reported in Georgia .",

The launch , 907 days ( approx . 29 months ) after the loss of Columbia , was approved despite unresolved fuel sensor anomalies in the external tank that had prevented the shuttle from launching on 13 July , its originally scheduled date . The mission ended on 9 August 2005 when Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California . Poor weather over the Kennedy Space Center in Florida hampered the shuttle from using its primary landing site . Analysis of the launch footage showed debris separating from the external tank during ascent ; this was of particular concern because it was the issue that had set off the Columbia disaster . As a result , NASA decided on 27 July to postpone future shuttle flights pending additional modifications to the flight hardware . Shuttle flights resumed a year later with STS-121 on 4 July 2006 .",
  "/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster": "The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster was a fatal incident in the United States space program that occurred on February 1 , 2003 , when the Space Shuttle Columbia ( OV-102 ) disintegrated as it re-entered the atmosphere , killing all seven crew members . The disaster was the second fatal accident in the Space Shuttle program , after the 1986 breakup of Challenger soon after liftoff . During the launch of STS-107 , Columbia 's 28th mission , a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter . Similar foam shedding had occurred during previous shuttle launches , causing damage that ranged from minor to nearly catastrophic , but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious . Before re-entry , NASA managers had limited the investigation , reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed . When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth , the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate the heat shield and destroy the internal wing structure , which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart . After the disaster , Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years , as they had been after the Challenger disaster . Construction of the International Space Station ( ISS ) was put on hold ; the station relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State Space Corporation for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew rotation until STS-121 . NASA ultimately made several technical and organizational changes , including adding a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the shuttle 's thermal protection system had endured the ascent , and keeping a designated rescue mission ready in case irreparable damage was found . Except for one final mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope , subsequent shuttle missions were flown only to the ISS so that the crew could use it as a haven if damage to the orbiter prevented safe reentry .",

  "/wiki/2006_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active since 1997 as well as the first season since 2001 in which no hurricanes made landfall in the United States , and was the first since 1994 in which no tropical cyclones formed during October . Following the intense activity of 2005 , forecasters predicted that the 2006 season would be only slightly less active . Instead activity was slowed by a rapidly forming moderate El Ni\u00f1o event , the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic , and the steady presence of a robust secondary high-pressure area to the Azores high centered on Bermuda . There were no tropical cyclones after October 2 . Tropical Storm Alberto was indirectly responsible for two deaths when it made landfall in Florida . Hurricane Ernesto caused heavy rainfall in Haiti , and directly killed at least seven in Haiti and the United States . Four hurricanes formed after Ernesto , including the strongest storms of the season , Hurricanes Helene and Gordon . In total , the season was responsible for 14 deaths and $ 500 million ( 2006 USD ; $ 634 million 2020 USD ) in damage . The calendar year 2006 also saw Tropical Storm Zeta , which arose in December 2005 and persisted until early January , only the second such event on record .
