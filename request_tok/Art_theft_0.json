  "/wiki/Louvre": "The Louvre ( English : /\u02c8lu\u02d0v ( r\u0259 ) / LOOV ( -r\u0259 ) ) , or the Louvre Museum ( French : Mus\u00e9e du Louvre [ myze dy luv\u0281 ] ( listen ) ) , is the world 's largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris , France . A central landmark of the city , it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city 's 1st arrondissement ( district or ward ) . Approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square meters ( 782,910 square feet ) . In 2019 , the Louvre received 9.6 million visitors . The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace , originally built as the Louvre castle in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II . Remnants of the fortress are visible in the basement of the museum . Due to urban expansion , the fortress eventually lost its defensive function , and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings . The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace . In 1682 , Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household , leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection , including , from 1692 , a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture . In 1692 , the building was occupied by the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture , which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons . The Acad\u00e9mie remained at the Louvre for 100 years . During the French Revolution , the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation 's masterpieces .",

It is considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance , and has been described as the best known , the most visited , the most written about , the most sung about , the most parodied work of art in the world . The painting 's novel qualities include the subject 's expression , which is frequently described as enigmatic , the monumentality of the composition , the subtle modelling of forms , and the atmospheric illusionism . The painting is likely of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini , the wife of Francesco del Giocondo , and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel . It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506 ; however , Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517 . Recent academic work suggests that it would not have been started before 1513 . It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic itself , on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris since 1797 . The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world . It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at US $ 100 million in 1962 ( equivalent to $ 650 million in 2018 ) .",

  "/wiki/Ghent_Altarpiece": "The Ghent Altarpiece ( or the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb , Dutch : Het Lam Gods ) is a large and complex 15th-century polyptych altarpiece in St Bavo 's Cathedral , Ghent , Belgium . It was begun c. the mid-1420s and completed before 1432 , and is attributed to the Early Netherlandish painters and brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck . The altarpiece is considered a masterpiece of European art and one of the world 's treasures . The panels are organised in two vertical registers , each with double sets of foldable wings containing inner and outer panel paintings . The upper register of the inner panels represent the heavenly redemption , and include the central De\u00ebsis of Christ the King ( or perhaps God the Father ) , the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist . They are flanked in the next panels by angels playing music and , on the far outermost panels , the figures of Adam and Eve . The four lower-register panels are divided into two pairs ; sculptural grisaille paintings of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist , and on the two outer panels , donor portraits of Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut . The central panel of the lower register shows a gathering of saints , sinners , clergy and soldiers attendant at an adoration of the Lamb of God . There are several groupings of figures , overseen by the dove of the Holy Spirit . [ A ] The altarpiece is one of the most renowned and important artworks in European history . Art historians generally agree that the overall structure was designed by Hubert during or before the mid 1420s , probably before 1422 , and that the panels were painted by his younger brother Jan . Yet , while generations of art historians have attempted to attribute specific passage to either brother , no convincing separation has been established , it may be that Jan finished panels begun by Hubert .",
  "/wiki/Jan_van_Eyck": "Jan van Eyck ( /v\u00e6n \u02c8a\u026ak/ van EYEK , Dutch : [ \u02c8j\u0251n v\u0251n \u02c8\u025bik ] ; c. before 1390 - 9 July 1441 ) was a painter from the County of Loon ( present day Belgium ) active in Bruges . He is one of the early innovators of what became known as Early Netherlandish painting , and one of the most significant representatives of Early Northern Renaissance art . The surviving records of his early life indicate that he was born around 1380-1390 , most likely in Maaseik ( then Maaseyck , hence his name ) , in present-day Belgium . He took employment in the Hague around 1422 , when he was already a master painter with workshop assistants , and employed as painter and valet de chambre with John III the Pitiless , ruler of Holland and Hainaut . He was then employed in Lille as court painter to Philip the Good , Duke of Burgundy after John 's death in 1425 , until he moved to Bruges in 1429 where he lived until his death . He was highly regarded by Philip and undertook a number of diplomatic visits abroad , including to Lisbon in 1428 to explore the possibility of a marriage contract between the duke and Isabella of Portugal . About 20 surviving paintings are confidently attributed to him , as well as the Ghent Altarpiece and the illuminated miniatures of the Turin-Milan Hours , all dated between 1432 and 1439 . Ten are dated and signed with a variation of his motto ALS ICH KAN ( As I ( Eyck ) can ) , a pun on his name , which he typically painted in Greek characters . Van Eyck painted both secular and religious subject matter , including altarpieces , single-panel religious figures and commissioned portraits . His work includes single panels , diptychs , triptychs , and polyptych panels . He was well paid by Philip , who sought that the painter was secure financially and had artistic freedom so that he could paint whenever he pleased . Van Eyck 's work comes from the International Gothic style , but he soon eclipsed it , in part through a greater emphasis on naturalism and realism .",
  "/wiki/Hubert_van_Eyck": "Hubert van Eyck or Huybrecht van Eyck ( c. 1385/90 - 18 September 1426 ) was an Early Netherlandish painter and older brother of Jan van Eyck , [ a ] as well as Lambert and Margareta , also painters . The absence of any single work that he can clearly be said to have completed continues to make an assessment of his achievement highly uncertain , although for centuries he had the reputation of being an outstanding founding artist of Early Netherlandish painting .",

  "/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II": "The Allies of World War II , called the United Nations from the 1 January 1942 declaration , were the countries that together opposed the Axis powers during the Second World War ( 1939-1945 ) . The Allies promoted the alliance as a means to control German , Japanese and Italian aggression . At the start of the war on 1 September 1939 , the Allies consisted of France , Poland and the United Kingdom , as well as their dependent states , such as British India . Within days they were joined by the independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth : Australia , Canada , New Zealand and South Africa . After the start of the German invasion of North Europe until the Balkan Campaign , the Netherlands , Belgium , Greece , and Yugoslavia joined the Allies . After first having cooperated with Germany in invading Poland whilst remaining neutral in the Allied-Axis conflict , the Soviet Union perforce joined the Allies in June 1941 after being invaded by Germany . The United States provided war materiel and money all along , and officially joined in December 1941 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . China had already been in a prolonged war with Japan since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident of 1937 , but officially joined the Allies in 1941 . The alliance was formalised by the Declaration by United Nations , from 1 January 1942 . However , the name United Nations was rarely used to describe the Allies during the war . The leaders of the Big Three - the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom , and the United States - controlled Allied strategy ; relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were especially close . The Big Three together with China were referred as a trusteeship of the powerful , then were recognized as the Allied Big Four in the Declaration by United Nations and later as the Four Policemen of the United Nations .",

The most famous illuminated manuscript associated with the town , the 5th-century Quedlinburg Itala fragment , once in the church , had been moved to a museum in Berlin and was not stolen . The missing artifacts started resurfacing in 1987 . After various lawsuits against and negotiations with the heirs of the by-then deceased Meador , they were restored to their rightful owners .

  "/wiki/Statute_of_limitations": "A statute of limitations is a law passed by a legislative body in a common law system to set the maximum time after an event within which legal proceedings may be initiated . When the time specified in a statute of limitations passes , a claim might no longer be filed or , if filed , may be subject to dismissal if the defense against that claim is raised that the claim is time-barred as having been filed after the statutory limitations period . When a statute of limitations expires in a criminal case , the courts no longer have jurisdiction . Most crimes that have statutes of limitations are distinguished from serious crimes as these may be brought at any time . In civil law systems , similar provisions are typically part of their civil or criminal codes and known collectively as periods of prescription . The cause of action dictates the statute of limitations , which can be reduced ( or extended ) to ensure a fair trial . The intention of these laws is to facilitate resolution within a reasonable length of time . What amount of time is considered reasonable varies from country to country , and within countries such as the United States from state to state . Within countries and states , the statute of limitations may vary from one civil or criminal action to another . Some nations have no statute of limitations whatsoever . Analysis of a statute of limitations also requires the examination of any associated statute of repose , tolling provisions , and exclusions .",

She was best known for her paintings of enlarged flowers , New York skyscrapers , and New Mexico landscapes . O'Keeffe has been recognized as the Mother of American modernism . In 1905 , O'Keeffe began her serious formal art training at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and then the Art Students League of New York , but she felt constrained by her lessons that focused on recreating or copying what was in nature . In 1908 , unable to fund further education , she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator , and then taught in Virginia , Texas , and South Carolina between 1911 and 1918 . During that time , she studied art during the summers between 1912 and 1914 and was introduced to the principles and philosophies of Arthur Wesley Dow , who created works of art based upon personal style , design , and interpretation of subjects , rather than trying to copy or represent them . This caused a major change in the way she felt about and approached art , as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the University of Virginia and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction . Alfred Stieglitz , an art dealer and photographer , held an exhibit of her works in 1917 . Over the next couple of years , she taught and continued her studies at the Teachers College , Columbia University in 1914 and 1915 . She moved to New York in 1918 at Stieglitz 's request and began working seriously as an artist . They developed a professional relationship and a personal relationship that led to their marriage in 1924 . O'Keeffe created many forms of abstract art , including close-ups of flowers , such as the Red Canna paintings , that many found to represent female genitalia , although O'Keeffe consistently denied that intention .",

An innovative and prolific master in three media , he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history . Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century , Rembrandt 's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter , from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes , genre scenes , allegorical and historical scenes , and biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies . His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age , when Dutch art ( especially Dutch painting ) , although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe , was extremely prolific and innovative and gave rise to important new genres . Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age , such as Jan Vermeer of Delft , Rembrandt was also an avid art collector and dealer . Rembrandt never went abroad , but he was considerably influenced by the work of the Italian masters and Netherlandish artists who had studied in Italy , like Pieter Lastman , the Utrecht Caravaggists , and Flemish Baroque Peter Paul Rubens . Having achieved youthful success as a portrait painter , Rembrandt 's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships . Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime , his reputation as an artist remained high , and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters . Rembrandt 's portraits of his contemporaries , self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs . His self-portraits form a unique and intimate biography , in which the artist surveyed himself without vanity and with the utmost sincerity . Rembrandt 's foremost contribution in the history of printmaking was his transformation of the etching process from a relatively new reproductive technique into a true art form , along with Jacques Callot . His reputation as the greatest etcher in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime and never questioned since .",

He is considered the most influential artist of Flemish Baroque tradition . Rubens 's highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history . His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement , colour , and sensuality , which followed the immediate , dramatic artistic style promoted in the Counter-Reformation . Rubens specialized in making altarpieces , portraits , landscapes , and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects . In addition to running a large studio in Antwerp that produced paintings popular with nobility and art collectors throughout Europe , Rubens was a classically educated humanist scholar and diplomat who was knighted by both Philip IV of Spain and Charles I of England . Rubens was a prolific artist . The catalogue of his works by Michael Jaff\u00e9 lists 1,403 pieces , excluding numerous copies made in his workshop . His commissioned works were mostly history paintings , which included religious and mythological subjects , and hunt scenes . He painted portraits , especially of friends , and self-portraits , and in later life painted several landscapes . Rubens designed tapestries and prints , as well as his own house .

Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century , he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement , the invention of constructed sculpture , the co-invention of collage , and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore . Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon ( 1907 ) , and Guernica ( 1937 ) , a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces during the Spanish Civil War . Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years , painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence . During the first decade of the 20th century , his style changed as he experimented with different theories , techniques , and ideas . After 1906 , the Fauvist work of the slightly older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles , beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists , who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art . Picasso 's work is often categorized into periods . While the names of many of his later periods are debated , the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period ( 1901-1904 ) , the Rose Period ( 1904-1906 ) , the African-influenced Period ( 1907-1909 ) , Analytic Cubism ( 1909-1912 ) , and Synthetic Cubism ( 1912-1919 ) , also referred to as the Crystal period . Much of Picasso 's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style , and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism . His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles . Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life , Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments , and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art .",
  "/wiki/Henry_Moore": "Henry Spencer Moore OM CH FBA ( 30 July 1898 - 31 August 1986 ) was an English artist . He is best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art . As well as sculpture , Moore produced many drawings , including a series depicting Londoners sheltering from the Blitz during the Second World War , along with other graphic works on paper . His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure , typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures . Moore 's works are usually suggestive of the female body , apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups . His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces . Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his Yorkshire birthplace . Moore became well known through his carved marble and larger-scale abstract cast bronze sculptures , and was instrumental in introducing a particular form of modernism to the United Kingdom . His ability in later life to fulfil large-scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy . Despite this , he lived frugally ; most of the money he earned went towards endowing the Henry Moore Foundation , which continues to support education and promotion of the arts .",

Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia , straddling the Bosporus strait ( which separates Europe and Asia ) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea . Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives in suburbs on the Asian side of the Bosporus . With a total population of around 15 million residents in its metropolitan area , Istanbul is one of the world 's most populous cities , ranking as the world 's fifth-largest city proper and the largest European city . The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ( coterminous with Istanbul Province ) . Founded under the name of Byzantion ( \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ) on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BCE , the city grew in size and influence , becoming one of the most important cities in history . After its reestablishment as Constantinople in 330 CE , it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries , during the Roman/Byzantine ( 330-1204 ) , Latin ( 1204-1261 ) , Palaiologos Byzantine ( 1261-1453 ) and Ottoman ( 1453-1922 ) empires . It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times , before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 CE and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate . Under the name Constantinople it was the Ottoman capital until 1923 . The capital was then moved to Ankara and the city was renamed Istanbul .

Cassatt often created images of the social and private lives of women , with particular emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and children . She was described by Gustave Geffroy in 1894 as one of les trois grandes dames ( the three great ladies ) of Impressionism alongside Marie Bracquemond and Berthe Morisot . In 1879 , Diego Martelli , compared her to Degas , as they both sought to depict movement , light , and design in the most modern sense .",

The term Impressionism is derived from the title of his painting Impression , soleil levant ( Impression , Sunrise ) , which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris . Monet 's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons . From 1883 , Monet lived in Giverny , where he purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works . He began painting the water lilies in 1899 , first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life .",

His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism . Pissarro studied from great forerunners , including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot . He later studied and worked alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54 . In 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists , becoming the pivotal figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members . Art historian John Rewald called Pissarro the dean of the Impressionist painters , not only because he was the oldest of the group , but also by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced , kind , and warmhearted personality . Paul C\u00e9zanne said he was a father for me . A man to consult and a little like the good Lord , and he was also one of Paul Gauguin 's masters . Pierre-Auguste Renoir referred to his work as revolutionary , through his artistic portrayals of the common man , as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without artifice or grandeur . Pissarro is the only artist to have shown his work at all eight Paris Impressionist exhibitions , from 1874 to 1886 . He acted as a father figure not only to the Impressionists but to all four of the major Post-Impressionists , Georges Seurat , Paul C\u00e9zanne , Vincent van Gogh , and Paul Gauguin .",

  "/wiki/1972_Montreal_Museum_of_Fine_Arts_robbery": "The 1972 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts robbery , sometimes called the Skylight Caper , took place very early in the morning of September 4 of that year . Three armed robbers used a skylight under repair to gain entry to the museum from its roof , tied up the three guards on duty , and left on foot with 18 paintings , including a rare Rembrandt landscape and works by Jan Brueghel the Elder , Corot , Delacroix , Rubens , and Thomas Gainsborough , as well as some figurines and jewellery . One of the Brueghels was returned by the thieves as an initiative to start ransom negotiations . None of the other paintings has ever been recovered and the robbers have never been arrested or even publicly identified , although there is at least one informal suspect . Collectively , the missing paintings have been valued at $ 11.7 million in 2017 dollars ; although their value may have diminished since the theft as scholars have called the attribution of some of the works into question . However , the Rembrandt alone has been valued at $ 1 million ; in 2003 The Globe and Mail estimated it to have appreciated in value to $ 20 million . The thieves appeared to know what works they were looking for ; many of the works had been part of Masterpieces from Montreal , a travelling exhibition that had been to many museums in the U.S. and Canada prior to Expo 67 , as well as some other special exhibits put on by the museum in the preceding years . It is not only the largest art theft in Canada but the largest theft in Canadian history . Investigation of the crime proved difficult in the early going , since it occurred over the Labour Day holiday weekend , when many of the museum 's officials including its director were vacationing far away from Montreal . It was further complicated by continuing news coverage of the Blue Bird Caf\u00e9 fire , Montreal 's deadliest arson , three days earlier , dominating the headlines ; the next day the killings of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the Olympics in Munich further diminished media coverage . A sting operation conceived after the thieves returned the Brueghel ( later reattributed to his students ) and mailed photos of the other works to the museum seeking a ransom payment went awry ; a later attempt to negotiate their return cost the museum $ 10,000 with no results . The thieves took advantage of weakened security , resulting from the renovations at the museum , which had left the skylight 's alarm disabled .",

As a painter and muralist , Delacroix 's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists , while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement . A fine lithographer , Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare , the Scottish author Walter Scott and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres , Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance , with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form . Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity , and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art , but to travel in North Africa , in search of the exotic . Friend and spiritual heir to Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault , Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron , with whom he shared a strong identification with the forces of the sublime , of nature in often violent action . However , Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast , and his Romanticism was that of an individualist . In the words of Baudelaire , Delacroix was passionately in love with passion , but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible . Together with Ingres , Delacroix is considered one of the last old Masters of painting , and one of the few who was ever photographed .",

He was the son of the eminent Flemish Renaissance painter Pieter Brueghel the Elder . A close friend and frequent collaborator with Peter Paul Rubens , the two artists were the leading Flemish painters in the first three decades of the 17th century . Brueghel worked in many genres including history paintings , flower still lifes , allegorical and mythological scenes , landscapes and seascapes , hunting pieces , village scenes , battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld . He was an important innovator who invented new types of paintings such as flower garland paintings , paradise landscapes , and gallery paintings in the first quarter of the 17th century . He further created genre paintings that were imitations , pastiches and reworkings of his father 's works , in particular his father 's genre scenes and landscapes with peasants . Brueghel represented the type of the pictor doctus , the erudite painter whose works are informed by the religious motifs and aspirations of the Catholic Counter-Reformation as well as the scientific revolution with its interest in accurate description and classification . He was court painter of the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella , the governors of the Southern Netherlands . The artist was nicknamed Velvet Brueghel , Flower Brueghel , and Paradise Brueghel . The first is believed to have been given him because of his mastery in the rendering of fabrics . The second nickname is a reference to his specialization in flower still lifes and the last one to his invention of the genre of the paradise landscape . His brother Pieter Brueghel the Younger was traditionally nicknamed de helse Brueghel or Hell Brueghel because it was believed he was the author of a number of paintings with fantastic depictions of fire and grotesque imagery .",

The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969 , following a split within the previous incarnation of the IRA and the broader Irish republican movement . It was the minority faction in the split , while the majority continued as the Official IRA . The term provisional was chosen to mirror the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic , and also to designate it as temporary pending reorganisation of the movement . Although this reorganisation eventually happened in 1970 , the name stuck . The Troubles had begun shortly before when a largely Catholic , nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) , culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British troops . The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas , but it began an offensive campaign in 1971 ( see timeline ) .

  "/wiki/Jerusalem": "Jerusalem [ note 2 ] is a city in the Middle East , located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea . It is one of the oldest cities in the world , and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions - Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital , as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power ; however , neither claim is widely recognized internationally . [ note 3 ] During its long history , Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice , besieged 23 times , captured and recaptured 44 times , and attacked 52 times . The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE , in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds . Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets , probably meaning City of Shalem after a Canaanite deity , during the Canaanite period ( 14th century BCE ) . During the Israelite period , significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE ( Iron Age II ) , and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah . In 1538 , the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent . Today those walls define the Old City , which has been traditionally divided into four quarters - known since the early 19th century as the Armenian , Christian , Jewish , and Muslim Quarters . The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981 , and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger . Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City 's boundaries . In 2015 , Jerusalem had a population of some 850,000 residents , comprising approximately 200,000 secular Jewish Israelis , 350,000 Haredi Jews and 300,000 Palestinians .",

The term Impressionism is derived from the title of his painting Impression , soleil levant ( Impression , Sunrise ) , which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris . Monet 's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons . From 1883 , Monet lived in Giverny , where he purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works . He began painting the water lilies in 1899 , first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life .",
  "/wiki/Impressionism": "Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small , thin , yet visible brush strokes , open composition , emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities ( often accentuating the effects of the passage of time ) , ordinary subject matter , inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience , and unusual visual angles . Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s . The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France . The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work , Impression , soleil levant ( Impression , Sunrise ) , which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari . The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature .",

It is located southeast of the French mainland and west of the Italian Peninsula , with the nearest land mass being the Italian island of Sardinia to the immediate south . A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island . The island is an administrative region of France ( with the regional capital being Ajaccio ) , divided in two administrative departments , Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud . The corresponding regional and departmental territorial collectivities , however , merged on 1 January 2018 , forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica . As a single territorial collectivity , Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regional collectivities ; for example , the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers . Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second largest town in Corsica . After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , in 1755 Corsica became a self-proclaimed Italian-speaking Republic , until it was officially ceded by Genoa to Louis XV as part of a pledge for debts and subsequently annexed to France in 1769 . Napoleon Bonaparte was born the same year in Ajaccio , and his ancestral home ( Maison Bonaparte ) is today a significant visitor attraction and museum .

He was a moderately successful provincial genre painter in his lifetime but evidently was not wealthy , leaving his wife and children in debt at his death , perhaps because he produced relatively few paintings . Vermeer worked slowly and with great care , and frequently used very expensive pigments . He is particularly renowned for his masterly treatment and use of light in his work . Vermeer painted mostly domestic interior scenes . Almost all his paintings are apparently set in two smallish rooms in his house in Delft ; they show the same furniture and decorations in various arrangements and they often portray the same people , mostly women . He was recognized during his lifetime in Delft and The Hague , but his modest celebrity gave way to obscurity after his death . He was barely mentioned in Arnold Houbraken 's major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting ( Grand Theatre of Dutch Painters and Women Artists ) , and was thus omitted from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries . In the 19th century , Vermeer was rediscovered by Gustav Friedrich Waagen and Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger , who published an essay attributing 66 pictures to him , although only 34 paintings are universally attributed to him today . Since that time , Vermeer 's reputation has grown , and he is now acknowledged as one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age .

  "/wiki/Manet": "\u00c9douard Manet ( UK : /\u02c8m\u00e6ne\u026a/ , US : /m\u00e6\u02c8ne\u026a , m\u0259-/ , French : [ edwa\u0281 man\u025b ] ; 23 January 1832 - 30 April 1883 ) was a French modernist painter . He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life , and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism . Born into an upper-class household with strong political connections , Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him , and became engrossed in the world of painting . His early masterworks , The Luncheon on the Grass ( Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe ) and Olympia , both 1863 , caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism . Today , these are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art . The last 20 years of Manet 's life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time , and develop his own style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters .",

Degas also produced bronze sculptures , prints , and drawings . Degas is especially identified with the subject of dance ; more than half of his works depict dancers . Although Degas is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism , he rejected the term , preferring to be called a realist , and did not paint outdoors as many Impressionists did . Degas was a superb draftsman , and particularly masterly in depicting movement , as can be seen in his rendition of dancers and bathing female nudes . In addition to ballet dancers and bathing women , Degas painted race horses and racing jockeys , as well as portraits . His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal of human isolation . At the beginning of his career , Degas wanted to be a history painter , a calling for which he was well prepared by his rigorous academic training and close study of classical art . In his early thirties , he changed course , and by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter , he became a classical painter of modern life .",

  "/wiki/Finial": "A finial or hip-knob is an element marking the top or end of some object , often formed to be a decorative feature . In architecture it is a decorative device , typically carved in stone , employed to emphasize the apex of a dome , spire , tower , roof , or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top , end , or corner of a building or structure . Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles . Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture . These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks . Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades , and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons . The charm at the end of a pull chain ( such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp ) is also known as a finial . During the various dynasties in China , a finial was worn on the top of the hats civil or military officials wore during formal court ceremonies . The finial was changed to a knob for other daily usage ( including semi-formal ceremonies ) . The Pickelhaube is a Central European military helmet with a finial topped by a spike .",
  "/wiki/The_Scream": "The Scream is the popular name given to a composition created by Norwegian Expressionist artist Edvard Munch in 1893 . The original German title given by Munch to his work was Der Schrei der Natur ( The Scream of Nature ) , and the Norwegian title is Skrik ( Shriek ) . The agonised face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of art , seen as symbolising the anxiety of the human condition . Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sunlight turned the clouds a blood red . He sensed an infinite scream passing through nature ' . Scholars have located the spot to a fjord overlooking Oslo , and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky , ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sisters commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum . Munch created two versions in paint and two in pastels , as well as a lithograph stone from which several prints survive . Both of the painted versions have been stolen , but since recovered . One of the pastel versions commanded the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at a public auction .",

His best known work , The Scream , has become one of the most iconic images of world art . His childhood was overshadowed by illness , bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family . Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in Kristiania ( today 's Oslo ) , Munch began to live a bohemian life under the influence of nihilist Hans J\u00e6ger , who urged him to paint his own emotional and psychological state ( 'soul painting ' ) . From this emerged his distinctive style . Travel brought new influences and outlets . In Paris , he learned much from Paul Gauguin , Vincent van Gogh and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec , especially their use of colour . In Berlin , he met Swedish dramatist August Strindberg , whom he painted , as he embarked on his major canon The Frieze of Life , depicting a series of deeply-felt themes such as love , anxiety , jealousy and betrayal , steeped in atmosphere . The Scream was conceived in Kristiania . According to Munch , he was out walking at sunset , when he heard the enormous , infinite scream of nature . The painting 's agonised face is widely identified with the angst of the modern person . Between 1893 and 1910 , he made two painted versions and two in pastels , as well as a number of prints .",

It constitutes both a county and a municipality . During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken , the northernmost Danish province . Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the name \u00c1nslo , and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada . The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300 . Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence . After being destroyed by a fire in 1624 , during the reign of King Christian IV , a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king 's honour . It was established as a municipality ( formannskapsdistrikt ) on 1 January 1838 . The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814-1905 union between Sweden and Norway . From 1877 , the city 's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage , a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897 . In 1925 the city , after incorporating the village retaining its former name , was renamed Oslo . In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker , a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger , thus creating the modern , vastly enlarged Oslo municipality .",

Brown was the son of Gawen and Elizabeth ( Byles ) Brown , and descended from the Rev . Increase Mather on his mother 's side . He was taught by his aunt and around 1773 ( age 12 ) became a pupil of Gilbert Stuart . He arrived in London in 1781 to further his training in Benjamin West 's studio , entered the Royal Academy schools in 1782 with plans to be a miniature painter , and began to exhibit a year later . In 1784 , he painted two religious paintings for the church of St. Marys-in-the-Strand , which led Brown to found a partnership with the painter Daniel Orme for the commercialization of these and other works through exhibition and the sale of engravings . Among these were large paintings of scenes from English history , as well as scenes from Shakespeare 's plays . However , despite their success he began to concentrate on portraiture . His first successes were with American sitters , among others his patron John Adams and family in 1784-85 ; this painting is now in the Boston Athen\u00e6um . In the spring of 1786 , he began painting the earliest known portrait of Thomas Jefferson , who was visiting London . He also painted Charles Bulfinch the same year .

As president , Jefferson pursued the nation 's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies . He also organized the Louisiana Purchase , almost doubling the country 's territory . As a result of peace negotiations with France , his administration reduced military forces .
