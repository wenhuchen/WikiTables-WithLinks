Sir Mortimer Wheeler 1945 , and Jean-Marie Casal conducted archaeological excavations there in 1947-1950 .

Digs have found Amphorae , Arretine ware , Roman lamps , glassware , glass and stone beads , and gems at the site . Based on these excavations , Wheeler concluded that the Arikamedu was a Greek ( Yavana ) trading post that traded with Rome , starting during the reign of Augustus Caesar , and lasted about two hundred years - from the late first century BCE to the first and second centuries CE . Subsequent investigation by Vimala Begley from 1989 to 1992 modified this assessment , and now place the period of settlement from the 2nd century BCE to the 8th century CE . Significant findings at Arikamedu include numerous Indo-Pacific beads , which facilitated fixing the period of its origin .
