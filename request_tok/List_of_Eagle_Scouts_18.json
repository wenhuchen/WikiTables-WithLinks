  "/wiki/New_Age": "New Age is a term applied to a range of spiritual or religious beliefs and practices that developed in the Western World during the 1970s . Precise scholarly definitions of the New Age differ in their emphasis , largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure . Although analytically often considered to be religious , those involved in it typically prefer the designation of spiritual or Mind , Body , Spirit and rarely use the term New Age themselves . Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement , although others contest this term and suggest that it is better seen as a milieu or zeitgeist . As a form of Western esotericism , the New Age drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions , in particular , those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Such prominent occultist influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer , as well as the ideas of Spiritualism , New Thought , and Theosophy . A number of mid-twentieth century influences , such as the UFO religions of the 1950s , the counterculture of the 1960s , and the Human Potential Movement , also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age . The exact origins of the phenomenon remain contested , but there is general agreement that it developed in the 1970s , at which time it was centered largely in the United Kingdom . It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s , in particular within the United States . By the start of the 21st century , the term New Age was increasingly rejected within this milieu , with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended . Despite its highly eclectic nature , a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age have been identified . Theologically , the New Age typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity that imbues all of the universe , including human beings themselves .",

Located at the heart of the Indochinese peninsula , Laos is bordered by Myanmar and China to the northwest , Vietnam to the east , Cambodia to the southeast and Thailand to the west and southwest . Present Laos traces historic and cultural identity to the kingdom of Lan Xang Hom Khao ( Kingdom of a Million Elephants Under the White Parasol ) , which existed from the mid-fourteenth century to early eighteenth century as one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia . Due to its central geographical location in Southeast Asia , the kingdom became a hub for overland trade , turned wealthy economically and culturally . After a period of internal conflict , Lan Xang broke off into three separate kingdoms - Luang Phrabang , Vientiane , and Champasak . In 1893 , the three territories came under French protectorate and were united to form what is now known as Laos . It briefly gained independence in 1945 after Japanese occupation , but was recolonised by France until it won autonomy in 1949 . Laos became independent in 1953 , with a constitutional monarchy under Sisavang Vong . A post-independence civil war began , which saw the communist resistance , supported by the Soviet Union and North Vietnam , fight against the monarchy that later came under influence of military regimes supported by the United States . After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 , the communist Pathet Lao movement came to power , ending the civil war and establishing a one-party state . Laos was then dependent on military and economic aid from the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991 .

  "/wiki/Star_Trek_(film)": "Star Trek is a 2009 American science fiction action film directed by J. J. Abrams and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman . It is the eleventh film in the Star Trek film franchise , and is also a reboot that features the main characters of the original Star Trek television series portrayed by a new cast , as the first in the rebooted film series . The film follows James T. Kirk ( Chris Pine ) and Spock ( Zachary Quinto ) aboard the USS Enterprise as they combat Nero ( Eric Bana ) , a Romulan from their future who threatens the United Federation of Planets . The story takes place in an alternate reality because of time travel by both Nero and the original Spock ( Leonard Nimoy ) . The alternate timeline was created in an attempt to free the film and the franchise from established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements . The idea for a prequel film which would follow the Star Trek characters during their time in Starfleet Academy was discussed by series creator Gene Roddenberry in 1968 . The concept resurfaced in the late 1980s , when it was postulated by Harve Bennett as a possible plotline for what would become Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country , but it was rejected in favor of other projects by Roddenberry . Following the critical and commercial failure of Star Trek : Nemesis and the cancellation of Star Trek : Enterprise , the franchise 's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen wrote an unproduced film titled Star Trek : The Beginning , which would take place after Enterprise . After the separation of Viacom and CBS Corporation in 2005 , former Paramount Pictures president Gail Berman convinced CBS to allow Paramount to produce a new film in the franchise . Orci and Kurtzman , both fans of Star Trek , were approached to write the film , and J. J. Abrams was approached to direct it . Kurtzman and Orci used inspiration from novels and graduate school dissertations , as well as the series itself .

  "/wiki/Submarine": "A submarine ( or sub ) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater . It differs from a submersible , which has more limited underwater capability . It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots , as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels , such as the midget submarine and the wet sub . Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes . In modern submarines , this structure is the sail in American usage and fin in European usage .",

The 338-acre ( 137 ha ) campus is located on the former grounds of Fort Severn at the confluence of the Severn River and Chesapeake Bay in Anne Arundel County , 33 miles ( 53 km ) east of Washington , D.C. and 26 miles ( 42 km ) southeast of Baltimore . The entire campus ( known to insiders as the Yard ) is a National Historic Landmark and home to many historic sites , buildings , and monuments . It replaced Philadelphia Naval Asylum , in Philadelphia , that served as the first United States Naval Academy from 1838 to 1845 when the Naval Academy formed in Annapolis . Candidates for admission generally must both apply directly to the academy and receive a nomination , usually from a Member of Congress . Students are officers-in-training and are referred to as midshipmen . Tuition for midshipmen is fully funded by the Navy in exchange for an active duty service obligation upon graduation . Approximately 1,200 plebes ( an abbreviation of the Ancient Roman word plebeian ) enter the Academy each summer for the rigorous Plebe Summer . About 1,000 midshipmen graduate . Graduates are usually commissioned as ensigns in the Navy or second lieutenants in the Marine Corps , but a small number can also be cross-commissioned as officers in other U.S. services , and the services of allied nations .

  "/wiki/STS-2": "STS-2 was the second Space Shuttle mission conducted by NASA , and the second flight of the orbiter Columbia . The mission launched on 12 November 1981 and landed two days later on 14 November . STS-2 marked the first time that a crewed , reusable orbital vehicle returned to space . This mission tested the Shuttle Imaging Radar as part of the OSTA-1 payload , along with a wide range of other experiments including the Shuttle robotic arm , commonly known as Canadarm . Other experiments or tests included Shuttle Multispectral Infrared Radiometer , Feature Identification and Location Experiment , Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites , Ocean Color Experiment , Night/Day optical Survey of Lightning , Heflex Bioengineering Test , and Aerodynamic Coefficient Identification Package ( ACIP ) . One of the feats accomplished was various tests on the OMS including starting and restarting the engines while in orbit and various adjustments to its orbit . The OMS tests also help adjust the Shuttle 's orbit for use of the radar . During the mission , President Reagan called the crew of STS-2 from Mission Control in Houston . In the early planning stages of the Space Shuttle program , STS-2 was intended to be a reboost mission for the aging Skylab space station . However , such a mission was impeded by delays with the shuttle 's development and the deteriorating orbit of Skylab . Skylab ultimately de-orbited on 11 July 1979 , two years before the launch of STS-2 .",

It also carried the first African-American astronaut , Guion Bluford . The mission successfully achieved all of its planned research objectives , but was marred by the subsequent discovery that a solid-fuel rocket booster had almost malfunctioned catastrophically during the launch . The mission 's primary payload was INSAT-1B , an Indian communications and weather observation satellite , which was released by the orbiter and boosted into a geostationary orbit . The secondary payload , replacing a delayed NASA communications satellite , was a four-metric-ton dummy payload , intended to test the use of the shuttle 's Canadarm remote manipulator system . Scientific experiments carried onboard Challenger included the environmental testing of new hardware and materials designed for future spacecraft , the study of biological materials in electric fields under microgravity , and research into space adaptation syndrome ( also known as space sickness ) . The flight furthermore served as shakedown testing for the previously launched TDRS-1 satellite , which would be required to support the subsequent STS-9 mission .",
