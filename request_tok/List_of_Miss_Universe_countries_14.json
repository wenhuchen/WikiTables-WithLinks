Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

The Gambia shares historical roots with many other West African nations in the slave trade , which was the key factor in the placing and keeping of a colony on the Gambia River , first by the Portuguese , during which era it was known as A G\u00e2mbia . Later , on 25 May 1765 , The Gambia was made a part of the British Empire when the government formally assumed control , establishing the Province of Senegambia . In 1965 , The Gambia gained independence under the leadership of Dawda Jawara , who ruled until Yahya Jammeh seized power in a bloodless 1994 coup . Adama Barrow became The Gambia 's third president in January 2017 , after defeating Jammeh in the December 2016 elections . Jammeh initially accepted the results , then refused to accept them , which triggered a constitutional crisis and military intervention by the Economic Community of West African States , resulting in his exile . The Gambia 's economy is dominated by farming , fishing and , especially , tourism . In 2015 , 48.6% of the population lived in poverty .",

Since its independence , Latvia has been referred to as one of the Baltic states . It is bordered by Estonia to the north , Lithuania to the south , Russia to the east , Belarus to the southeast , and shares a maritime border with Sweden to the west . Latvia has 1,957,200 inhabitants and a territory of 64,589 km2 ( 24,938 sq mi ) . The country has a temperate seasonal climate . The Baltic Sea moderates climate , although it has four distinct seasons and snowy winters . After centuries of Swedish , Polish and Russian rule , a rule mainly executed by the Baltic German aristocracy , the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 when it broke away from the Russian Empire and declared independence in the aftermath of World War I . However , by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 establishing an authoritarian regime under K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover . It ended with the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990 and restoring de facto independence on 21 August 1991 .

Its culture , people , and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours , making it essentially a mixture of French and German cultures , as evident by the nation 's three official languages : French , German , and the national language of Luxembourgish .

Luxembourg is a developed country , with an advanced economy and one of the world 's highest GDP ( PPP ) per capita . The City of Luxembourg with its old quarters and fortifications was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 due to the exceptional preservation of the vast fortifications and the old city .

At 592,800 square kilometres ( 228,900 sq mi ) Madagascar is the world 's 2nd largest island country . The nation comprises the island of Madagascar ( the fourth- largest island in the world ) and numerous smaller peripheral islands . Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana , Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago , allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation . Consequently , Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot ; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth . The island 's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats . The archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago . Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and 550 AD by Indianized Austronesian peoples , arriving on outrigger canoes from Indonesia . The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of Hinduism and Buddhism , along with native Indonesian culture . These were joined around the 9th century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa . Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time , each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life . The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more subgroups , of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands .",
