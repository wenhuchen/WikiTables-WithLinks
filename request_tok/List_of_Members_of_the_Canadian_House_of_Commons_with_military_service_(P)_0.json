The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice .

  "/wiki/Royal_Flying_Corps": "The Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War , until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force . During the early part of the war , the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance . This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements , the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transport facilities . At the start of World War I the RFC , commanded by Brigadier-General Sir David Henderson , consisted of five squadrons - one observation balloon squadron ( RFC No 1 Squadron ) and four aeroplane squadrons . These were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914 but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915 . Aerial photography was attempted during 1914 , but again only became effective the next year . By 1918 , photographic images could be taken from 15,000 feet and were interpreted by over 3,000 personnel . Parachutes were not available to pilots of heavier-than-air craft in the RFC - nor were they used by the RAF during the First World War - although the Calthrop Guardian Angel parachute ( 1916 model ) was officially adopted just as the war ended . By this time parachutes had been used by balloonists for three years . On 17 August 1917 , South African General Jan Smuts presented a report to the War Council on the future of air power . Because of its potential for the 'devastation of enemy lands and the destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale ' , he recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with the Army and Royal Navy . The formation of the new service would also make the under-used men and machines of the Royal Naval Air Service ( RNAS ) available for action on the Western Front and end the inter-service rivalries that at times had adversely affected aircraft procurement .",
