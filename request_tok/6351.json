The team 's primary colors are old gold and black ; their logo is a simplified fleur-de-lis . For most of their first 20 years , the Saints were barely competitive , only getting to .500 twice . In 1987 , they finished 12-3 - their first-ever winning season - and qualified for the NFL playoffs for the first time in franchise history , but lost to the Minnesota Vikings 44-10 .
