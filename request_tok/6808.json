  "/wiki/St_Leonard's_Church,_St_Leonards-on-Sea": "St Leonard 's Church is an Anglican church in the St Leonards-on-Sea area of Hastings , a town and borough in the English county of East Sussex . The main church serving James Burton high-class mid 19th-century new town of St Leonards-on-Sea was designed by Burton himself just before his death , and it survived for more than a century despite being damaged by the cliff into which it was built ; but one night during World War II , the sea-facing building was obliterated by a direct hit from a damaged V-1 doodlebug which had crossed the English Channel . The Gilbert Scott brothers ' bold replacement church was ready in 1961 , and along with a sister church at nearby Bulverhythe it continues to serve the parish of St Leonards-on-Sea , now part of the Hastings conurbation . English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance .",
  "/wiki/St_Leonards-on-Sea": "St Leonards-on-Sea ( commonly known as St Leonards ) is a town and seaside resort in the Borough of Hastings in East Sussex , England . It has been part of the borough since the late 19th century and lies to the west of central Hastings . The original part of the settlement was laid out in the early 19th century as a new town : a place of elegant houses designed for the well-off ; it also included a central public garden , a hotel , an archery , assembly rooms and a church . Today 's St Leonards has extended well beyond that original design , although the original town still exists within it .",
  "/wiki/Anglicanism": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",
  "/wiki/James_Burton_(1761\u20131837)": "Lieutenant-Colonel James Burton ( born James Haliburton ) ( 29 July 1761 - 31 March 1837 ) was the most successful and imperative property developer of Regency and Georgian London . By the time of his death in 1837 , Burton had built over 3000 properties , and his buildings covered over 250 acres of central London . His imperative contribution to the development of the West End has been acknowledged by James Manwaring Baines , John Summerson , and Dana Arnold . Steen Eiler Rasmussen , in London : The Unique City , commended Burton 's buildings , but did not identify their architect . The 21st century Oxford Dictionary of National Biography contends that Burton were 'the most successful developer in late Georgian London , responsible for some of its most characteristic architecture ' . James built the majority of the Bloomsbury district ( including Bedford Square , Russell Square , Bloomsbury Square , Tavistock Square , and Cartwright Gardens ) ; St John 's Wood ; Regent Street ; Regent Street St. James ; Waterloo Place , St. James 's ; Swallow Street ; Regents Park ( including the Inner Circle villas , Chester Terrace , Cornwall Terrace , Clarence Terrace , and York Terrace ) . James financed , patronized , and built the other projects of John Nash around Regents Park - most of which were predominantly designed by James 's son , Decimus Burton , rather than by Nash himself - to the extent that the Commissioners of Woods described James , not Nash , as the architect of Regents Park . James also conceived , planned , and developed the town of St Leonards-on-Sea , which is now part of Hastings . James was a leading member of London high society during the Georgian era and the Regency era . He was an early member of the Athenaeum Club , London , whose Clubhouse his company built to the design of his son Decimus Burton , who was the Club 's 'prime member ' . James was a close friend of Princess Victoria ( the future Queen Victoria ) , and with the Duchess of Kent . He was Master of the Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers , and Sheriff of Kent .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/V-1_(flying_bomb)": "The V-1 flying bomb ( German : Vergeltungswaffe 1 Vengeance Weapon 1 [ a ] ) - also known to the Allies as the buzz bomb , or doodlebug , [ b ] and in Germany as Kirschkern ( cherry stone ) [ c ] or Maik\u00e4fer ( maybug ) [ d ] , as well as by its official RLM aircraft designation of Fi 103 - was an early cruise missile and the only production aircraft to use a pulsejet for power . The V-1 was the first of the so-called Vengeance weapons series ( V-weapons or Vergeltungswaffen ) deployed for the terror bombing of London . It was developed at Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center in 1939 by the Nazi German Luftwaffe at the beginning of the Second World War , and during initial development was known by the codename Cherry Stone . Because of limited range , thousands of V-1 missiles launched into England were fired from launch facilities along the French ( Pas-de-Calais ) and Dutch coasts . The Wehrmacht first launched the V-1 to target London on 13 June 1944 , one week after ( and prompted by ) the successful Allied landings in Europe . At peak , more than one hundred V-1s a day were fired at south-east England , 9,521 in total , decreasing in number as sites were overrun until October 1944 , when the last V-1 site in range of Britain was overrun by Allied forces . After this , the Germans directed V-1s at the port of Antwerp and at other targets in Belgium , launching 2,448 V-1s . The attacks stopped only a month before the war in Europe ended , when the last launch site in the Low Countries was overrun on 29 March 1945 . As part of Operation Crossbow , the British operated an arrangement of air defences , including anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft , to intercept the bombs before they reached their targets , while the launch sites and underground V-1 storage depots became targets for Allied strategic bombing .",

  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery . Paired windows were sometimes surmounted by a simple opening such as a quatrefoil cut in plate tracery . This form gave way to the more ornate , multi-light traceried windowed .",
  "/wiki/Stained_glass": "The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it . Throughout its thousand-year history , the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings . Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows , the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture . Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight . Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages . In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived .",

Different styles of classical architecture have arguably existed since the Carolingian Renaissance , and prominently since the Italian Renaissance . Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly , they can in general all be said to draw on a common vocabulary of decorative and constructive elements . In much of the Western world , different classical architectural styles have dominated the history of architecture from the Renaissance until the second world war , though it continues to inform many architects to this day . The term classical architecture also applies to any mode of architecture that has evolved to a highly refined state , such as classical Chinese architecture , or classical Mayan architecture . It can also refer to any architecture that employs classical aesthetic philosophy . The term might be used differently from traditional or vernacular architecture , although it can share underlying axioms with it .

Of the three canonic orders , the Ionic order has the narrowest columns . The Ionic capital is characterized by the use of volutes . The Ionic columns normally stand on a base which separates the shaft of the column from the stylobate or platform ; the cap is usually enriched with egg-and-dart .

  "/wiki/Eminent_domain": "Eminent domain ( United States , Philippines ) , land acquisition ( India , Malaysia , Singapore ) , compulsory purchase ( United Kingdom , New Zealand , Ireland ) , resumption ( Hong Kong , Uganda ) , resumption/compulsory acquisition ( Australia ) , or expropriation ( France , Italy , Mexico , South Africa , Canada , Brazil , Portugal , Spain , Chile , Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Finland , Germany , Panama ) is the power of a state , provincial , or national government to take private property for public use . It doesnt include the power to take and transfer ownership of private property from one property owner to another private property owner without a valid public purpose . However , this power can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities , government subdivisions , or even to private persons or corporations , when they are authorized by the legislature to exercise the functions of public character . In the Anglo-American historical context , property taken could be used only by the government taking the property in question . The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads , government buildings and public utilities . However , in the mid-20th century , a new application of eminent domain was pioneered , in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party . This was initially done only to a property that has been deemed blighted or a development impediment , on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners , but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new third-party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government . Some jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property , before resorting to the use of eminent domain . However , once the property is taken and the judgment is final , the condemnor owns it in fee simple , and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action . Takings may be of the subject property in its entirety ( total take ) or in part ( part take ) , either quantitatively or qualitatively ( either partially in fee simple or , commonly , an easement , or any other interest less than the full fee simple title ) .",
  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

  "/wiki/House_church": "A house church or home church is a label used to describe a group of Christians who regularly gather for worship in private homes . The group may be part of a larger Christian body , such as a parish , but some have been independent groups that see the house church as the primary form of Christian community . Sometimes these groups meet because the membership is small , and a home is the most appropriate place to assemble until such time as the group has sufficient funds to rent a regular place to meet ( as in the beginning phase of the British New Church Movement ) . Sometimes this meeting style is advantageous because the group is a member of a Christian congregation which is otherwise banned from meeting as is the case in China and Iran . Some recent Christian writers have supported the view that the Christian Church should meet in houses , and have based the operation of their communities around multiple small home meetings . Other Christian groups choose to meet in houses when they are in the early phases of church growth because a house is the most affordable option for the small group to meet until the number of people attending the group is sufficient to warrant moving to a commercial location such as a church building . House church organizations claim that this approach is preferable to public meetings in dedicated buildings because it is a more effective way of building community and personal relationships , and it helps the group to engage in outreach more naturally . Some believe small churches were a deliberate apostolic pattern in the first century , and they were intended by Christ .",

  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading .

[ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Great_Storm_of_1987": "The Great Storm of 1987 was a violent extratropical cyclone that occurred on the night of 15-16 October , with hurricane-force winds causing casualties in England , France and the Channel Islands as a severe depression in the Bay of Biscay moved northeast . Among the most damaged areas were Greater London , the East Anglian coast , the Home Counties , the west of Brittany and the Cotentin Peninsula of Normandy , all of which weathered gusts typically with a return period of 1 in 200 years . Forests , parks , roads and railways were strewn with fallen trees as well as schools being closed . The British National Grid suffered heavy damage , leaving thousands without power . At least 22 people were killed in England and France . The highest measured gust of 117 kn ( 217 km/h ; 135 mph ) was recorded at Pointe Du Roc , Granville , France and the highest gust in the UK of 106 kn ( 196 km/h ; 122 mph ) was recorded at Gorleston-on-Sea . The storm has been termed a weather bomb due to its rapid development . That day 's weather reports had failed to indicate a storm of such severity , an earlier , correct forecast having been negated by later projections . The apparent suggestion by the BBC 's Michael Fish of a false alarm is celebrated as a classic gaffe , though he claims he was misquoted .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
