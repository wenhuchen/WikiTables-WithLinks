  "/wiki/Temple_University": "Temple University ( Temple or TU ) is a public research university in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . It was founded in 1884 by the Baptist minister Russell Conwell . In 1882 , Conwell came to Pennsylvania to lead the Grace Baptist Church while he began tutoring working-class citizens late at night to accommodate their work schedules . These students - later dubbed night owls - were taught in the basement of Conwell 's Baptist Temple , hence the origin of the university 's name and mascot . By 1907 , the institution revised its institutional status and was incorporated as a university . As of 2019 , about 40,000 undergraduate , graduate and professional students were enrolled in more than 600 academic degree programs offered at sites across the globe , including eight campuses across Pennsylvania , Rome and Japan . Temple is among the world 's largest providers of professional education ( law , medicine , podiatry , pharmacy , dentistry , and architecture ) , preparing the largest body of professional practitioners in Pennsylvania .

  "/wiki/Sculptor": "Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions . It is one of the plastic arts . Durable sculptural processes originally used carving ( the removal of material ) and modelling ( the addition of material , as clay ) , in stone , metal , ceramics , wood and other materials but , since Modernism , there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process . A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving , assembled by welding or modelling , or molded or cast . Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials , and often represents the majority of the surviving works ( other than pottery ) from ancient cultures , though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely . However , most ancient sculpture was brightly painted , and this has been lost . Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures , and until recent centuries large sculptures , too expensive for private individuals to create , were usually an expression of religion or politics . Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean , India and China , as well as many in Central and South America and Africa . The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece , and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period . During the Middle Ages , Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith . The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo 's David . Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body , with the making of constructed sculpture , and the presentation of found objects as finished art works .",

  "/wiki/Institute,_West_Virginia": "Institute is an unincorporated community on the Kanawha River in Kanawha County , West Virginia , United States . Interstate 64 and West Virginia Route 25 pass by the community , which has grown to intermingle with nearby Dunbar . Institute is home to West Virginia State University ( formerly the West Virginia Colored Institute and the source of the town 's toponym ) and the West Virginia State Police Academy . In August 2008 a chemical plant explosion here killed two and injured eight at the Bayer CropScience facility . The community is the location of the prehistoric Shawnee Reservation Mound , one of three remaining Adena-era earthwork mounds and enclosures found in an eight-mile stretch along the river . Also called Fairgrounds Mound and Poorhouse Mound , it is now located within Shawnee Regional Park . The mound is about 20 feet high and 80 feet in basal diameter , but was originally 25 feet high and greater than 80 feet in diameter . In the late 19th century , the Smithsonian Institution inventoried an Adena-era complex along the Kanawha River that had more than 50 earthwork mounds and ten enclosures . These works were likely built by indigenous peoples from approximately 300 BCE to 200 CE . During a 1902 archaeological exploration by Gerard Fowke , a total of 27 fully wrapped mummies were discovered in near perfect conditions due to the unique qualities of the local weather conditions . Most of these mounds have been lost to development in the area , particularly of Charleston . Located on the campus of West Virginia State University are the historic East Hall and Canty House , both listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 .",
