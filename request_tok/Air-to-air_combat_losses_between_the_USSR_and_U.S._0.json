The Corsair was designed and operated as a carrier-based aircraft , and entered service in large numbers with the U.S. Navy in late 1944 and early 1945 . It quickly became one of the most capable carrier-based fighter-bombers of World War II . Some Japanese pilots regarded it as the most formidable American fighter of World War II and its naval aviators achieved an 11:1 kill ratio . Early problems with carrier landings and logistics led to it being eclipsed as the dominant carrier-based fighter by the Grumman F6F Hellcat , powered by the same Double Wasp engine first flown on the Corsair 's first prototype in 1940 . Instead , the Corsair 's early deployment was to land-based squadrons of the U.S. Marines and U.S. Navy . The Corsair served almost exclusively as a fighter-bomber throughout the Korean War and during the French colonial wars in Indochina and Algeria . In addition to its use by the U.S. and British , the Corsair was also used by the Royal New Zealand Air Force , French Naval Aviation , and other air forces until the 1960s .

B-29s also dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which contributed to the end of World War II . One of the largest aircraft of World War II , the B-29 had state-of-the-art technology , including a pressurized cabin ; dual-wheeled , tricycle landing gear ; and an analog computer-controlled fire-control system that allowed one gunner and a fire-control officer to direct four remote machine gun turrets . The $ 3 billion cost of design and production ( equivalent to $ 43 billion today ) - far exceeding the $ 1.9 billion cost of the Manhattan Project - made the B-29 program the most expensive of the war . The B-29 's advanced design allowed it to remain in service in various roles throughout the 1950s . The type was retired in the early 1960s , after 3,970 had been built . A few were used as flying television transmitters by the Stratovision company . The Royal Air Force flew the B-29 as the Washington until 1954 .

Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

Constituting the bulk of the territory of Murmansk Oblast , it lies almost completely inside the Arctic Circle and is bordered by the Barents Sea in the north and the White Sea in the east and southeast . The city of Murmansk is the most populous human settlement on the peninsula , with a population of over 300,000 as of the 2010 Census . While the north of the peninsula was already settled in the 7th-5th millennium BCE , the rest of its territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BCE , when various peoples started to arrive from the south . However , by the 1st millennium CE only the Sami people remained . This changed in the 12th century , when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula 's game and fish riches . Soon after , the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic , and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands . No permanent settlements , however , were established by the Novgorodians until the 15th century . The Soviet period saw a rapid increase of the population , although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads . The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization , including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements , and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized , largely due to its strategic position and the discovery of the vast apatite deposits in the 1920s . As a result , the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage , including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting . After the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease .",
  "/wiki/B-47_Stratojet": "The Boeing B-47 Stratojet ( Boeing company designation Model 450 ) is a retired American long-range , six-engined , turbojet-powered strategic bomber designed to fly at high subsonic speed and at high altitude to avoid enemy interceptor aircraft . The primary mission of the B-47 was as a nuclear bomber capable of striking targets within the Soviet Union . Development of the B-47 can be traced back to a requirement expressed by the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) in 1943 for a reconnaissance bomber that harnessed newly developed jet propulsion . Another key innovation adopted during the development process was the swept wing , drawing upon captured German research . With its engines carried in nacelles underneath the wing , the B-47 represented a major innovation in post-World War II combat jet design , and contributed to the development of modern jet airliners . Suitably impressed , in April 1946 , the USAAF ordered two prototypes , designated XB-47 ; on 17 December 1947 , the first prototype performed its maiden flight . Facing off competition such as the North American XB-45 , Convair XB-46 and Martin XB-48 , a formal contract for 10 B-47A bombers was signed on 3 September 1948 . This would be soon followed by much larger contracts . During 1951 , the B-47 entered operational service with the United States Air Force 's Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) , quickly becoming a mainstay of its bomber strength by the late 1950s . Over 2,000 were manufactured to meet the Air Force 's extensive demands , driven by the tensions of the Cold War . The B-47 was in service as a strategic bomber until 1965 , at which point it had largely been supplanted by more capable aircraft , such as the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress . However , the B-47 was also adapted to perform a number of other roles and functions , including photographic reconnaissance , electronic intelligence , and weather reconnaissance .",

Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",

  "/wiki/B-66_Destroyer": "The Douglas B-66 Destroyer was a light bomber that was designed and produced by the American aviation manufacturer Douglas Aircraft Company . The B-66 was developed for the United States Air Force ( USAF ) and is heavily based upon the United States Navy 's A-3 Skywarrior , a heavy carrier-based attack aircraft . Originally , officials intended for the aircraft to be a simple development of the earlier A-3 , taking advantage of being strictly land-based to dispense with unnecessary naval features . However , due to the USAF producing extensive and substantially divergent requirements , it became necessary to make considerable alterations to the design , leading to a substantial proportion of the B-66 being original rather than derived from the A-3 . The B-66 retained the three-man crew arrangement of the US Navy 's A-3 ; differences included the incorporation of ejection seats , which the A-3 had lacked . Performing its maiden flight on 28 June 1954 , the aircraft was introduced to USAF service during 1956 . The standard model , designated B-66 , was a bomber model that was procured to replace the aging Douglas A-26 Invader ; in parallel , a dedicated photo reconnaissance model , designated RB-66 , was also produced alongside . Later on , further variants of the type were developed , leading to the aircraft 's use in signals intelligence , electronic countermeasures and weather reconnaissance roles . Aircraft would commonly be forward deployed to bases in Europe , where they could more easily approach the airspace of the Soviet Union . Multiple variants would be deployed around Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis . They would also see use during the American intervention in the Vietnam War , typically operating as support aircraft for other assets that were active over the skies of North Vietnam . The last examples of the type were withdrawn during 1975 .",
