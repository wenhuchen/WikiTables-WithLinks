Monticello , along with much of San Juan County , experienced an increase in population and economic activity during the uranium boom from the late 1940s to the early 1960s . Several uranium and vanadium mines were opened in the area , and a uranium processing mill was operated in Monticello by the Federal Government from 1948 to 1960 . Following the uranium boom , a massive cleanup project was conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy from 1989 to 2004 to remove radioactive material from lands and buildings and to restore the land formerly occupied by the mill . An 18-hole golf course , The Hideout , was built near the reclaimed site of the uranium mill using DOE cleanup funding in 2000 . The Hideout has been ranked the No . 2 Golf Course in Utah and the No . 23 Municipal Golf Course in the U.S .
