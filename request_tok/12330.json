  "/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church": "The Catholic Church , sometimes referred to as the Roman Catholic Church , is the largest Christian church , with approximately 1.3 billion baptised Catholics worldwide as of 2017 [ update ] . As the world 's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution , it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation . The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope . Its central administration is the Holy See . The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed . The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , [ note 1 ] that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles , and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ . It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith , reserving infallibility , passed down by sacred tradition . The Latin Church , the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches , and institutes such as mendicant orders , enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church . Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the principal one , celebrated liturgically in the Mass . The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ . The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven , honoured in dogmas and devotions . Its teaching includes Divine Mercy , sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel as well as Catholic social teaching , which emphasises voluntary support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy .",

  "/wiki/French_people": "French people ( French : Fran\u00e7ais ) are a Western European nation that share a common French culture and speak the French language and are identified with the country of France . French people are the descendants of Gauls and Romans ( western european Celtic and Italic peoples ) , as well as Bretons , Aquitanians , Ligurians and finally Germanic people such as the Franks , the Visigoths , the Suebi , the Saxons , the Allemanni , and the Burgundians that settled Gaul from east of the Rhine after the fall of the Roman Empire and the Norse who settled in Normandy and to a lesser extent Brittany in the early 10th century . France has long been a patchwork of local customs and regional differences , and while most French people still speak the French language as their mother tongue , languages like Norman , Occitan , Catalan , Auvergnat , Corsican , Basque , French Flemish , Lorraine Franconian , Alsatian , and Breton remain spoken in their respective regions . Arabic is also widely spoken , arguably the largest minority language in France as of the 21st century ( a spot previously held by Breton and Occitan ) . Modern French society is a melting pot . From the middle of the 19th century , it experienced a high rate of inward migration , mainly consisting of Arab-Berbers , Jews , Sub-Saharan Africans , Chinese , and other peoples from Africa , the Middle East and East Asia , and the government , defining France as an inclusive nation with universal values , advocated assimilation through which immigrants were expected to adhere to French values and cultural norms . Nowadays , while the government has let newcomers retain their distinctive cultures since the mid-1980s and requires from them a mere integration , French citizens still equate their nationality with citizenship as does French law . In addition to mainland France , French people and people of French descent can be found internationally , in overseas departments and territories of France such as the French West Indies ( French Caribbean ) , and in foreign countries with significant French-speaking population groups or not , such as Switzerland ( French Swiss ) , the United States ( French Americans ) , Canada ( French Canadians ) , Argentina ( French Argentines ) , Brazil ( French Brazilians ) , Chile ( French Chileans ) and Uruguay ( French Uruguayans ) .",
  "/wiki/Parish": "A parish is a territorial entity in many Christian denominations , constituting a division within a diocese . A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a priest , often termed a parish priest , who might be assisted by one or more curates , and who operates from a parish church . Historically , a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor . Its association with the parish church remains paramount . By extension the term parish refers not only to the territorial entity but to the people of its community or congregation as well as to church property within it . In England this church property was technically in ownership of the parish priest ex-officio , vested in him on his institution to that parish .",
