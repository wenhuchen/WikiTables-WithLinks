  "/wiki/Secular": "Secularity ( derived from the word secular which comes from Latin saeculum meaning worldly , of a generation , temporal , or a span of about 100 years ) is the state of being separate from religion , or of not being exclusively allied with or against any particular religion . Historically , the word secular was not related or linked to religion , but was a freestanding term in Latin which would relate to any mundane endeavour . However , the term , saecula saeculorum ( saecul\u014drum being the genitive plural of saeculum ) as found in the New Testament in the Vulgate translation ( circa 410 ) of the original Koine Greek phrase \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f30\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd ( eis to\u00f9s aionas ton ai\u1e53n\u014dn ) , e.g . at Galatians 1:5 , was used in the early Christian church ( and is still used today ) , in the doxologies , to denote the coming and going of the ages , the grant of eternal life , and the long duration of created things from their beginning to forever and ever . The idea of a dichotomy between religion and the secular originated in the European Enlightenment . Furthermore , since religion and secular are both Western concepts that were formed under the influence of Christian theology , other cultures do not necessarily have words or concepts that resemble or are equivalent to them . In many cultures , little conceptual or practical distinction is made between 'natural ' and 'supernatural ' phenomena and the very notions of religious and nonreligious dissolve into unimportance , nonexistence , or unawareness , especially since people have beliefs in other supernatural or spiritual things irrespective of belief in God or gods . Conceptions of what is and what is not religion vary in contemporary East Asia as well . The shared term for irreligion or no religion ( \u7121\u5b97\u6559 , Chinese pron . w\u00fa z\u014dngji\u00e0o , Japanese pron . mu sh\u016bky\u014d ) with which the majority of East Asian populations identify themselves implies non-membership in one of the institutional religions ( such as Buddhism and Christianity ) but not necessarily non-belief in traditional folk religions collectively represented by Chinese Shendao ( sh\u00e9n d\u00e0o ) and Japanese Shinto ( both meaning ways of gods ) .

  "/wiki/The_New_Church": "The New Church ( or Swedenborgianism ) is the name for several historically related Christian denominations that developed as a new religious group , influenced by the writings of scientist and Swedish Lutheran theologian Emanuel Swedenborg ( 1688-1772 ) . According to Swedenborg , he received a new revelation from Christ in visions he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years . He predicted in his writings that God would replace the traditional Christian Church , establishing a New Church that would worship Jesus Christ as God . According to New Church doctrine , each person must cooperate in repentance , reformation , and regeneration . The movement was founded on the belief that God explained the spiritual meaning of the Bible to Swedenborg to reveal the truth of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ . Swedenborg cited divine revelation for his writings , and his followers believe that he witnessed the Last Judgment in the spiritual world with the inauguration of the New Church . The church is seen by its members as what Jesus is establishing with those who believe that he is the one God of heaven and Earth , with obedience to Jesus 's commandments being necessary for salvation . It is thought that any Christian holding these beliefs is part of the New Church . New Church organizations acknowledge what they believe to be the universal nature of Jesus 's church : all who do good in accordance with the truth of their religion will be accepted by Jesus into heaven ( since God is goodness itself ) , and doing good joins one with God . Adherents believe that New Church doctrine is derived from the Bible and provides enlightenment of the truth ; this leads to diminished doubt , a recognition of personal faults , and a more-focused , happier life . Other names for the movement include Swedenborgian , New Christians , Neo-Christians , Church of the New Jerusalem , and The Lord 's New Church . Although those outside the church may refer to the movement as Swedenborgianism , some adherents distance themselves from this title ( which implies following Swedenborg , rather than Jesus ) .",

  "/wiki/Reformed_Presbyterian_Church_of_North_America": "The Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America ( RPCNA ) is a Presbyterian church with congregations and missions throughout the United States , Canada , and Japan . Its beliefs - formulated via membership in the Reformed Presbyterian Church and RP Global Alliance - place it in the conservative wing of the Reformed family of Protestant churches . Below the Bible - which is held as divinely inspired and without error - the church is committed to several subordinate standards , together considered with its constitution : the Westminster Confession of Faith and Larger and Shorter Catechisms , along with its Testimony , Directory for Church Government , the Book of Discipline , and Directory for Worship . Primary doctrinal distinctions which separate the RPCNA from other Reformed and Presbyterian denominations in North America are : its continued adherence to the historical practice of Reformed Christianity , contained in the Westminster Confession of Faith , of practicing exclusive psalmody , and its continuing affirmation of Jesus as mediatorial king , ruling over all nations . Prior to the 1960s , the RPCNA refused to vote or participate in government in the United States due to it not directly acknowledging Christ 's authority over it , and since has continued ( at some times more heavily than others ) , to lobby the federal government to expressly submit to the authority of Jesus Christ in the U.S. Constitution . The RPCNA has a long history , having been a separate denomination in the United States since colonial days . In Scotland ( where the denomination originated ) , Reformed Presbyterians have been a separate branch since the late 17th century , and prior to that , a part of the original Presbyterian Church of Scotland that came out of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century . As its name suggests , the RPCNA is governed through the presbyterian system ( which the church considers to be the only divinely-appointed method of church government ) , with each individual congregation being governed by two or more elders . As with most Presbyterian denominations , the RPCNA is divided into several presbyteries , but unlike several other smaller Presbyterian denominations , the supreme governing body is a single synod , not a general assembly . Each congregation may send one ruling elder delegate ( two for larger congregations ) to its presbytery meeting , as well as to the annual Synod meeting . Each minister ( teaching elder ) , whether serving as the pastor of a congregation or not , is automatically a delegate to his presbytery and to the synod .",
