In 1905 , Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa showed that the asteroid varied in brightness .

Alternatively , it may come from Coronis , a nymph of the Hyades sisterhood . The Koronis family is named after this asteroid .

At other locations , a small object would go into its own orbit around one of the large bodies , but at the Lagrangian points the gravitational forces of the two large bodies , the centripetal force of orbital motion , and ( for certain points ) the Coriolis acceleration all match up in a way that cause the small object to maintain a stable or nearly stable position relative to the large bodies . There are five such points , labeled L1 to L5 , all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies , for each given combination of two orbital bodies . For instance , there are five Lagrangian points L1 to L5 for the Sun-Earth system , and in a similar way there are five different Lagrangian points for the Earth-Moon system . L1 , L2 , and L3 are on the line through the centers of the two large bodies . L4 and L5 each form an equilateral triangle with the centers of the large bodies .

Jupiter 's atmospheric composition and ammonia clouds were recorded , the clouds possibly created by outflows from the lower depths of the atmosphere .

One observation of an occultation of a star by Vala is from Italy ( May 26 , 2002 ) . 10-\u03bcm radiometric data collected from Kitt Peak in 1975 gave a diameter estimate of 34 km . In the Tholen classification system , it is categorized as an SU-type asteroid , while the Bus asteroid taxonomy system lists it as a K-type asteroid . Photometric observations of this asteroid during 2007 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces , New Mexico were used to create a nearly symmetric bimodal light curve plot . This showed a rotation period of 10.359 \u00b1 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.09 \u00b1 0.02 magnitude during each cycle . The result is double the 5.18 hour period reported in the JPL Small-Body Database . On 2028-Apr-05 , Vala will pass 0.0276 AU ( 4,130,000 km ; 2,570,000 mi ) from asteroid 2 Pallas .",

  "/wiki/1655_Comas_Sol\u00e0": "1655 Comas Sol\u00e0 , provisional designation 1929 WG , is a rare-type asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt , approximately 36 kilometers in diameter . It was discovered on 28 November 1929 , by Spanish astronomer of Catalan origin , Josep Comas i Sol\u00e0 at the Fabra Observatory in Barcelona , Spain . It was later named after the discoverer .",
  "/wiki/B-type_asteroid": "B-type asteroids are a relatively uncommon type of carbonaceous asteroid , falling into the wider C-group . In the asteroid population , B-class objects can be found in the outer asteroid belt , and also dominate the high-inclination Pallas family which includes the second-largest asteroid 2 Pallas . They are thought to be primitive , volatile-rich remnants from the early Solar System . There are 65 known B-type asteroids in the SMASS classification , and 9 in the Tholen classification as of March 2015 ."
