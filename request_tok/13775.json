  "/wiki/Flying_Fish_Records": "Flying Fish Records was a record label founded in Chicago in 1974 that specialized in folk , blues , and country music . In the 1990s the label was sold to Rounder Records . Bruce Kaplan , the label 's founder , was a native of Chicago and the son of a president of Zenith Electronics . He studied anthropology at the University of Chicago and became president of the school 's folklore society . He began Flying Fish in 1974 to concentrate on traditional and contemporary folk music , though the catalog grew to include blues , bluegrass , country , jazz , reggae , dancefloor and rock . When Kaplan started the label , most similarly oriented companies produced albums with decidedly homemade packaging ( e.g . cover art , etc . ) and marketed the albums to a relatively narrow audience of aficionados . Kaplan realized that music of this sort had the potential to reach a wider audience , but needed to be packaged in a professional manner ; people not already devotees were unlikely to take a chance on something that did not look like it came from a real record company . Kaplan also invested in broader promotion of the music ( wide provision of albums to radio ; targeted advertising to back up tours ) . Essentially , he located a niche between the hit-based promotion model of the major labels and the faith of the small independents that the music would find its own audience . [ citation needed ] Flying Fish recording artists were able to find that audience at the local Evanston , Illinois , venue Amazingrace Coffeehouse , which presented numerous artists off the roster , including Vassar Clements , John Hartford , New Grass Revival , Norman Blake , and Claudia Schmidt .",
