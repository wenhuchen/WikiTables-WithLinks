  "/wiki/Rugby_league_positions": "A rugby league team consists of thirteen players on the field , with four substitutes on the bench . Each of the thirteen players is assigned a position , normally with a standardised number , which reflects their role in attack and defence , although players can take up any position at any time . Players are divided into two general types , forwards and backs . Forwards are generally chosen for their size and strength . They are expected to run with the ball , to attack , and to make tackles . Forwards are required to improve the team 's field position thus creating space and time for the backs . Backs are usually smaller and faster , though a big , fast player can be of advantage in the backs . Their roles require speed and ball-playing skills , rather than just strength , to take advantage of the field position gained by the forwards . Typically forwards tend to operate in the centre of the field , while backs operate nearer to the touch-lines , where more space can usually be found .",
