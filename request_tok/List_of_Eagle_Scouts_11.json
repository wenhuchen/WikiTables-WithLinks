  "/wiki/Submarine": "A submarine ( or sub ) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater . It differs from a submersible , which has more limited underwater capability . It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots , as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels , such as the midget submarine and the wet sub . Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes . In modern submarines , this structure is the sail in American usage and fin in European usage .",

  "/wiki/American_Football_League": "The American Football League ( AFL ) was a major professional American football league that operated for ten seasons from 1960 until 1969 , when it merged with the older National Football League ( NFL ) , and became the American Football Conference . The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence . It was more successful than earlier rivals to the NFL with the same name , the 1926 , 1936 and 1940 leagues , and the later All-America Football Conference ( which existed between 1944 and 1950 but only played between 1946 and 1949 ) . This fourth version of the AFL was the most successful , created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises . The AFL 's original lineup consisted of an Eastern division of the New York Titans , Boston Patriots , Buffalo Bills , and the Houston Oilers , and a Western division of the Los Angeles Chargers , Denver Broncos , Oakland Raiders , and Dallas Texans . The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the NFL 's first-round draft choices in 1960 , including Houston 's successful signing of college star and Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon . While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance , the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) ( followed by a contract with the competing National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) for games starting with the 1965 season ) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide . Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s , as well as successful franchise shifts of the Chargers from L.A. south to San Diego and the Texans north to Kansas City ( becoming the Kansas City Chiefs ) , the AFL established a dedicated following . The transformation of the struggling Titans into the New York Jets under new ownership further solidified the league 's reputation among the major media . As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues , especially after a series of raids , the leagues agreed to a merger in 1966 . Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions first played in early 1967 , which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl . The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970 , with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game .",

Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

  "/wiki/Seattle_Mariners": "The Seattle Mariners are an American professional baseball team based in Seattle , Washington . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) West division . The team joined the American League as an expansion team in 1977 playing their home games in the Kingdome . Since July 1999 , the Mariners ' home ballpark has been T-Mobile Park ( formerly Safeco Field ) , located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle . The Mariners name originates from the prominence of marine culture in the city of Seattle . They are nicknamed the M 's , a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992 . They adopted their current team colors - navy blue , northwest green ( teal ) , and silver - prior to the 1993 season , after having been royal blue and gold since the team 's inception . Their mascot is the Mariner Moose . The organization did not field a winning team until 1991 , and any real success eluded them until 1995 when they won their first division championship and defeated the New York Yankees in the ALDS . The game-winning hit in Game 5 , in which Edgar Mart\u00ednez drove home Ken Griffey Jr. to win the game in the 11th inning , clinched a series win for the Mariners , served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle , and has since become an iconic moment in team history . The Mariners won 116 games in 2001 , which set the American League record for most wins in a single season and tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the Major League record for most wins in a single season . Through the end of the 2019 season , the franchise has finished with a losing record in 29 of 43 seasons .",
  "/wiki/Norman_Rockwell": "Norman Percevel Rockwell ( February 3 , 1894 - November 8 , 1978 ) was an American painter and illustrator . His works have a broad popular appeal in the United States for their reflection of American culture . Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine over nearly five decades . Among the best-known of Rockwell 's works are the Willie Gillis series , Rosie the Riveter , The Problem We All Live With , Saying Grace , and the Four Freedoms series . He is also noted for his 64-year relationship with the Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) , during which he produced covers for their publication Boys ' Life , calendars , and other illustrations . These works include popular images that reflect the Scout Oath and Scout Law such as The Scoutmaster , A Scout is Reverent and A Guiding Hand , among many others . Norman Rockwell was a prolific artist , producing more than 4,000 original works in his lifetime . Most of his works are either in public collections , or have been destroyed in fire or other misfortunes . Rockwell was also commissioned to illustrate more than 40 books , including Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn as well as painting the portraits for Presidents Eisenhower , Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon , as well as those of foreign figures , including Gamal Abdel Nasser and Jawaharlal Nehru . His portrait subjects included Judy Garland . One of his last portraits was of Colonel Sanders in 1973 . His annual contributions for the Boy Scouts calendars between 1925 and 1976 ( Rockwell was a 1939 recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award , the highest adult award given by the Boy Scouts of America ) , were only slightly overshadowed by his most popular of calendar works : the Four Seasons illustrations for Brown & Bigelow that were published for 17 years beginning in 1947 and reproduced in various styles and sizes since 1964 .",

  "/wiki/Spacelab": "Spacelab was a reusable laboratory developed by ESA and used on certain spaceflights flown by the Space Shuttle . The laboratory comprised multiple components , including a pressurized module , an unpressurized carrier and other related hardware housed in the Shuttle 's cargo bay . The components were arranged in various configurations to meet the needs of each spaceflight . Spacelab components flew on a total of about 32 Shuttle missions , depending on how such hardware and mission are tabulated . Spacelab allowed scientists to perform experiments in microgravity in Earth orbit . There was a variety of Spacelab-associated hardware , so a distinction can be made between the major Spacelab program missions with European scientists running missions in the Spacelab habitable module , missions running other Spacelab hardware experiments , and other STS missions that used some component of Spacelab hardware . There is some variation in counts of Spacelab missions , in part because there were different types of Spacelab missions with a large range in the amount of Spacelab hardware flown and the nature of each mission . There were at least 22 major Spacelab missions between 1983 and 1998 , and Spacelab hardware was used on a number other missions , with some of the Spacelab pallets being flown as late as 2008 .",
