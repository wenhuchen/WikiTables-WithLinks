  "/wiki/Computer_animation": "Computer animation is the process used for digitally generating animated images . The more general term computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images , while computer animation only refers to moving images . Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics , although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic , low bandwidth , and faster real-time renderings . Sometimes , the target of the animation is the computer itself , but sometimes film as well . Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to stop motion techniques , but using 3D models , and traditional animation techniques using frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations . Computer-generated animations are more controllable than other , more physically based processes , like constructing miniatures for effects shots , or hiring extras for crowd scenes , because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology . It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors , expensive set pieces , or props . To create the illusion of movement , an image is displayed on the computer monitor and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it but advanced slightly in time ( usually at a rate of 24 , 25 , or 30 frames/second ) . This technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with television and motion pictures . For 3D animations , objects ( models ) are built on the computer monitor ( modeled ) and 3D figures are rigged with a virtual skeleton . For 2D figure animations , separate objects ( illustrations ) and separate transparent layers are used with or without that virtual skeleton . Then the limbs , eyes , mouth , clothes , etc .",

  "/wiki/Infomercials_(TV_specials)": "Infomercials is an umbrella title for a project of quarter-hour American television comedy specials airing on Adult Swim . Unlike actual paid programming , all of the programs are fictitious , and for the most part maintain no continuity with each other . Most of them lampoon the format of actual infomercials , while others parody tropes and cliches in niche media such as closed-circuit hotel information channels , industrial films , sitcoms , older reality television formats of the past , and public-access television . A number of the titles may be purposefully filmed to have a standard definition look and framing to go with the aesthetics of those works . The specials typically air at 4 a.m. ET/PT . There is no title card or common identifier to any of the specials , and on some electronic program guide listings , it can be confused as an actual segment of paid programming ; if there is a description , it is generic or blank , with no season or episode numbers . Every title has a different look and feel as outside the common Williams Street/Adult Swim production logos ( and most of the time , state tax credit-funded productions with the Georgia Department of Economic Development 's card because they were filmed in the network 's home state ) , there are no common directors , production companies or crew between all of them , although some have returned to make additional ( and unrelated ) programs . One in particular , Too Many Cooks , is notable for gathering media interest in November 2014 . It contains a long-form introduction sequence common to 1980s and 1990s TV shows , except with a seemingly endless cast that continued to be introduced for 11 minutes straight .",
  "/wiki/Infomercial": "An infomercial is a form of television commercial , which generally includes a toll-free telephone number or website . Most often used as a form of direct response television ( DRTV ) , long-form infomercials are typically 28:30 or 58:30 minutes in length . Infomercials are also known as paid programming ( or teleshopping in Europe ) . This phenomenon started in the United States , where infomercials were typically shown overnight ( usually 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. ) , outside peak prime time hours for commercial broadcasters . Some television stations chose to air infomercials as an alternative to the former practice of signing off . Some channels air infomercials 24 hours . Some stations also choose to air infomercials during the daytime hours mostly on weekends to fill in for unscheduled network or syndicated programming . By 2009 , most infomercial spending in the U.S. occurred during the early morning , daytime and evening hours , or in the afternoon . Stations in most countries around the world have instituted similar media structures . The infomercial industry is worth over $ 200 billion . While the term infomercial was originally applied only to television advertising , it is now sometimes used to refer to any presentation ( often on video ) which presents a significant amount of information in an actual , or perceived , attempt to promote a point of view . When used this way , the term may be meant to carry an implication that the party making the communication is exaggerating truths or hiding important facts .",
  "/wiki/Graveyard_slot": "A graveyard slot ( or death slot ) is a time period in which a television audience is very small compared to other times of the day , and therefore broadcast programming is considered far less important . Graveyard slots are usually in the early morning hours of each day , when most people are asleep . With little likelihood of a substantial viewing audience during this daypart , providing useful television programming during this time is usually considered unimportant ; some broadcast stations go off the air during these hours , and some audience measurement systems do not collect measurements for these periods . Some broadcasters may do engineering work at this time . Others use broadcast automation to pass-through network feeds unattended , with only broadcasting authority-mandated personnel and emergency anchors/reporters present at the local station overnight . A few stations use we 're always on or a variant to promote their 24-hour operation as a selling point , though as this is now the rule rather than the exception it was in the past , it has now mainly become a selling point for a station 's website instead .",
