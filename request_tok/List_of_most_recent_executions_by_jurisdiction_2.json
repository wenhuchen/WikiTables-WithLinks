It shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest , Kosovo [ a ] to the northeast , North Macedonia to the east , Greece to the south and maritime borders with Greece , Montenegro and Italy to the west . Geographically , the country displays varied climatic , geological , hydrological and morphological conditions , defined in an area of 28,748 km2 ( 11,100 sq mi ) . It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab , Skanderbeg , Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea . Historically , the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians , Thracians , Ancient Greeks , Romans , Byzantines , Venetians and Ottomans . The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century . The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries . Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century , the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe . Between the 18th and 19th centuries , Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance . After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars , the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912 . In the 20th century , the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany . Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation .",
  "/wiki/Hanging": "Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck . The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck , though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain hanging . Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times , and is the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions . The first known account of execution by hanging was in Homer 's Odyssey ( Book XXII ) . In this specialised meaning of the common word hang , the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung . Hanging is also a common method of suicide in which a person applies a ligature to the neck and brings about unconsciousness and then death by suspension or partial suspension .",

  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",
  "/wiki/Firing_squad": "Execution by firing squad , in the past sometimes called fusillading ( from the French fusil , rifle ) , is a method of capital punishment , particularly common in the military and in times of war . Execution by shooting is a fairly old practice . Some reasons for its use are that firearms are usually readily available and a gunshot to a vital organ , such as brain or heart , usually kills relatively quickly . A firing squad is normally composed of several military personnel . Usually , all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously , thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot . To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head , the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart , sometimes aided by a paper target . The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded , as well as restrained , although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered . Media portrayals have frequently shown condemned being offered a final cigarette as well . Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting . There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light or at sunrise . This gave rise to the phrase shot at dawn . Execution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms , such as an execution by shooting to the back of the head or neck .",

It is bordered by Germany to the northwest , Czech Republic to the north , Slovakia to the northeast , Hungary to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

In the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution , Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People 's Republic , which was conquered by Soviet Russia . The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Byelorussian SSR ) . Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921 . Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939 , when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland , and were finalized after World War II . During WWII , military operations devastated Belarus , which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources . The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years .

  "/wiki/War_crimes": "A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the laws of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility . Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners , torturing , destroying civilian property , taking hostages , performing a perfidy , raping , using child soldiers , pillaging , declaring that no quarter will be given , and seriously violating the principles of distinction , proportionality , and military necessity . The concept of war crimes emerged at the turn of the twentieth century when the body of customary international law applicable to warfare between sovereign states was codified . Such codification occurred at the national level , such as with the publication of the Lieber Code in the United States , and at the international level with the adoption of the treaties during the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 . Moreover , trials in national courts during this period further helped clarify the law . Following the end of World War II , major developments in the law occurred . Numerous trials of Axis war criminals established the Nuremberg principles , such as notion that war crimes constituted crimes defined by international law . Additionally , the Geneva Conventions in 1949 defined new war crimes and established that states could exercise universal jurisdiction over such crimes . In the late 20th century and early 21st century , following the creation of several international courts , additional categories of war crimes applicable to armed conflicts other than those between states , such as civil wars , were defined .",

One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",

  "/wiki/Treason": "In law , treason is criminal disloyalty , typically to the state . It is a crime that covers some of the more extreme acts against one 's nation or sovereign . This usually includes things such as participating in a war against one 's native country , attempting to overthrow its government , spying on its military , its diplomats , or its secret services for a hostile and foreign power , or attempting to kill its head of state . A person who commits treason is known in law as a traitor . Historically , in common law countries , treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors , such as the murder of a husband by his wife or that of a master by his servant . Treason against the king was known as high treason and treason against a lesser superior was petty treason . As jurisdictions around the world abolished petty treason , treason came to refer to what was historically known as high treason . At times , the term traitor has been used as a political epithet , regardless of any verifiable treasonable action . In a civil war or insurrection , the winners may deem the losers to be traitors . Likewise the term traitor is used in heated political discussion - typically as a slur against political dissidents , or against officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents . In certain cases , as with the Dolchsto\u00dflegende ( Stab-in-the-back myth ) , the accusation of treason towards a large group of people can be a unifying political message .",

The official language of the country , Estonian , is the second-most-spoken Finnic language . The territory of Estonia has been inhabited since at least 9,000 BC . Ancient Estonians became some of the last European pagans to adopt Christianity - following the Livonian Crusade in the 13th century . After centuries of successive rule by Germans , Danes , Swedes , Poles and Russians , a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the 19th and early 20th centuries . This culminated in independence from Russia in 1920 after a brief War of Independence at the end of World War I . Initially democratic prior to the Great Depression , Estonia experienced authoritarian rule from 1934 during the Era of Silence . During World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , Estonia was repeatedly contested and occupied by the Soviet Union and Germany , ultimately being incorporated into the former . After the loss of its de facto independence , Estonia 's de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile . In 1987 the peaceful Singing Revolution began against Soviet rule , resulting in the restoration of de facto independence on 20 August 1991 .",

Such an injury is fatal to humans and animals , since it deprives all other organs of the involuntary functions that are needed for the body to function , while the brain is deprived of oxygenated blood and blood pressure . The term beheading refers to the act of deliberately decapitating a person , either as a means of murder or as an execution ; it may be accomplished with an axe , a sword , or a knife , or by mechanical means such as a guillotine . An executioner who carries out executions by beheading is sometimes called a headsman . Accidental decapitation can be the result of an explosion , a car or industrial accident , [ note 1 ] improperly administered execution by hanging or other violent injury . Suicide by decapitation is rare but not unknown . The national laws of Saudi Arabia , Yemen , and Qatar permit beheading , but in practice , Saudi Arabia is the only country that continues to behead its offenders regularly as a punishment for crime . Less commonly , decapitation can also refer to the removal of the head from a body that is already dead .

The device consists of a tall , upright frame with a weighted and angled blade suspended at the top . The condemned person is secured with stocks at the bottom of the frame , positioning the neck directly below the blade . The blade is then released , swiftly and forcefully decapitating the victim with a single , clean pass so that the head falls into a basket or other receptacle below . The guillotine is best known for its use in France , in particular during the French Revolution , where the revolution 's supporters celebrated it as the people 's avenger and the revolution 's opponents vilified it as the pre-eminent symbol of the violence of the Reign of Terror . While the name guillotine dates from this period , similar devices had been in use elsewhere in Europe over several centuries . The display of severed heads had long been one of the most common ways European sovereigns exhibited their power to their subjects . The guillotine was invented with the specific intention of making capital punishment more humane in accordance with Enlightenment ideals , as previous methods of execution in France had proven to be substantially more painful and prone to error . After its adoption , the device remained France 's standard method of judicial execution until the abolition of capital punishment in 1981 . The last person to be executed in France was Hamida Djandoubi , who was guillotined on 10 September 1977 .
