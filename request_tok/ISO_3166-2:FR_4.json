Often abbreviated to St-Barth in French , and St. Barths or St. Barts in English , the island lies about 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) south-east of the Dutch-country Sint Maarten and north-east of the Dutch islands of Saba , Sint Eustatius , and the independent country of Saint Kitts and Nevis . Saint Barth\u00e9lemy was for many years a French commune forming part of Guadeloupe , which is an overseas region and department of France . In 2003 the island voted in favour of secession from Guadeloupe in order to form a separate overseas collectivity ( collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer , abbreviated to COM ) of France . The collectivity is one of four territories among the Leeward Islands in the northeastern Caribbean that comprise the French West Indies , along with Saint Martin , Guadeloupe ( 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) southeast ) , and Martinique . Saint Barth\u00e9lemy , a volcanic island fully encircled by shallow reefs , has an area of 25 square kilometres ( 9.7 sq mi ) and a population of about 10,000 . Its capital is Gustavia , which also contains the main harbour . It is the only Caribbean island that was a Swedish colony for any significant length of time ; before the end of the Napoleonic Wars , Guadeloupe came under Swedish rule for nearly a century . Symbolism from the Swedish national arms , the Three Crowns , still appears in the island 's coat of arms . The language , cuisine , and culture , however , are distinctly French . The island is a popular tourist destination during the winter holiday season , geared towards the high-end , luxury tourist market .",
