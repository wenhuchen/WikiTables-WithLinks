The character and show , created by Richard Levinson and William Link , popularized the inverted detective story format , which begins by showing the commission of the crime and its perpetrator ; the plot therefore usually has no whodunit element , and instead revolves around how a perpetrator known to the audience will finally be caught and exposed ( sometimes referred to as a howcatchem ) . Columbo is a shrewd but inelegant blue-collar homicide detective whose trademarks include his rumpled beige raincoat , unassuming demeanor , frequent cigar smoking , old Peugeot 403 , unseen wife ( whom he mentions regularly ) , and catchphrase Just one more thing . His suspects are often affluent members of high society who try to carefully cover their tracks . Initially dismissive of Columbo 's circumstantial speech and apparent ineptitude , they become increasingly unsettled as his pestering behavior leads him to tease out incriminating evidence . His relentless approach often leads to self-incrimination or an outright confession by the suspect . Episodes of Columbo are between 70 and 98 minutes long , and have been broadcast in 44 countries . The 1971 episode Murder by the Book , directed by Steven Spielberg , was ranked No . 16 on TV Guide 's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time and in 1999 , the magazine ranked Lt.
