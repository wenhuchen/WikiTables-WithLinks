It belongs to the group of flavan-3-ols ( or simply flavanols ) , part of the chemical family of flavonoids . The name of the catechin chemical family derives from catechu , which is the tannic juice or boiled extract of Mimosa catechu ( Acacia catechu L.f ) .",

  "/wiki/Epigallocatechin": "Gallocatechol or gallocatechin ( GC ) is a flavan-3-ol , a type of chemical compound including catechin , with the gallate residue being in an isomeric trans position . It is one of the antioxidant chemicals found in food . This compound possesses two epimers . The most common , ( + ) -gallocatechin ( GC ) , CAS number 970-73-0 , is found notably in green tea . Other sources of ( + ) -gallocatechin are bananas , persimmons , and pomegranates . [ citation needed ] The other enantiomer is called ( - ) -gallocatechin or ent-gallocatechin . It was first isolated from green tea by Michiyo Tsujimura in 1934 . This compound had been shown to have moderate affinity to the human cannabinoid receptor , which may contribute to the health benefits found by consuming green tea . Epigallocatechin is another type of catechin , with the gallate residue being in an isomeric cis position . It can be found in St John 's wort .",
  "/wiki/Prodelphinidin": "Prodelphinidin is a name for the polymeric tannins composed of gallocatechin . It yields delphinidin during depolymerisation under oxidative conditions .",
  "/wiki/Epicatechin_gallate": "Epicatechin gallate ( ECG ) is a flavan-3-ol , a type of flavonoid , present in green tea . It is also reported in buckwheat and in grape . The tea component epicatechin gallate is being researched because in vitro experiments showed it can reverse methicillin resistance in bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus . Nevertheless , the compound is significantly degraded by steeping in boiling water , unlike related catechins . Epicatechin , as well as many other flavonoids , has been found to act as a non-selective antagonist of the opioid receptors , albeit with somewhat low affinity .",
  "/wiki/Epigallocatechin_gallate": "Epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) , also known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate , is the ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid , and is a type of catechin . EGCG , the most abundant catechin in tea , is a polyphenol under basic research for its potential to affect human health and disease . EGCG is used in many dietary supplements . EGCG is a second-order modulator of the GABAA receptor [ citation needed ] .",
