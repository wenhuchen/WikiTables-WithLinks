Thanks to the constant training with his older brother , Hisham Ashour , also a professional squash player , Ramy became the youngest player to reach number one in the world since the 1980s , as well as being the first ever two time World Junior Squash Champion . On April 22 , 2019 , at the age of 31 , Ashour announced his retirement from professional Squash . Ramy is known for his unique playing style , often referred to as 'The Artist ' ; he is regarded by many squash pundits , former and current players , to be one of the most naturally gifted players to ever play the game . Mohamed El Shorbagy , the 2017 world champion , once commented after losing in two world finals to him , as Ashour being 'the best of the best ' ; Jonah Barrington , also one of the Squash greats , ranks him as equal to Pakistani legends Jahangir Khan and Jansher Khan who dominated the game in the 1980s and 1990s . An unfortunate turn of events left Ashour plagued with a chronic hamstring problem in the twilight of his career . It almost certainly had an impact on his trophy cabinet , but Ashour himself took a characteristically philosophical approach to his injury , demonstrated in his various social media posts on the issue - citing his mental battle and desire for a full recovery . The injury itself came just after his 40+ match winning streak - where many players found it hard to play to his standard , which was defined by shorter rallies , reaction volleying and a unique insight into rally construction .",
