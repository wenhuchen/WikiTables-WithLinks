  "/wiki/Penrose_tiling": "A Penrose tiling is an example of an aperiodic tiling . Here , a tiling is a covering of the plane by non-overlapping polygons or other shapes , and aperiodic means that shifting any tiling with these shapes by any finite distance , without rotation , can not produce the same tiling . However , despite their lack of translational symmetry , Penrose tilings may have both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry . Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose , who investigated them in the 1970s . There are several different variations of Penrose tilings with different tile shapes . The original form of Penrose tiling used tiles of four different shapes , but this was later reduced to only two shapes : either two different rhombi , or two different quadrilaterals called kites and darts . The Penrose tilings are obtained by constraining the ways in which these shapes are allowed to fit together . This may be done in several different ways , including matching rules , substitution tiling or finite subdivision rules , cut and project schemes , and coverings . Even constrained in this manner , each variation yields infinitely many different Penrose tilings .",

  "/wiki/Conducting": "Conducting is the art of directing a musical performance , such as an orchestral or choral concert . It has been defined as the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture . The primary duties of the conductor are to interpret the score in a way which reflects the specific indications in that score , set the tempo , ensure correct entries by ensemble members , and shape the phrasing where appropriate . Conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures , usually with the aid of a baton , and may use other gestures or signals such as eye contact . A conductor usually supplements their direction with verbal instructions to their musicians in rehearsal . The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score , which contains the musical notation for all the instruments or voices . Since the mid-19th century , most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting , although in earlier periods of classical music history , leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common . In Baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s , the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist ( see concertmaster ) , an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period . Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras . Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance ( this is strictly the case in art music , but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles , there may be occasional spoken instructions , such as a count in ) . However , in rehearsals , frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung . Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct .",

Uniquely among the four mutually recognised royal surgical colleges in the United Kingdom and Ireland , it also incorporates a medical school , which is now Ireland 's largest with over 3,000 students from 60 countries . Since 2019 the body has had full university status , making it the first private university in Ireland . The RCSI 's main campus is situated on St. Stephen 's Green in Dublin , having received its royal charter in 1784 . At present , it incorporates schools of medicine , pharmacy , physiotherapy and nursing , and thus provides both undergraduate and postgraduate levels of education and research activities in a number of healthcare fields .",
  "/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_College_of_Surgeons": "Fellowship of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons ( FRCS ) is a professional qualification to practise as a senior surgeon in Ireland or the United Kingdom . It is bestowed on an intercollegiate basis by the four Royal Colleges of Surgeons ( the Royal College of Surgeons of England , Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland ( chartered 1784 ) , Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh ( chartered 1505 ) , and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow ) . The initials may be used as post-nominal letters . Several Commonwealth countries have organisations that bestow similar qualifications , among them the FRCSC in Canada , FRACS in Australia and New Zealand , FCS ( SA ) in South Africa , FCSHK in Hong Kong and FCPS by College of Physicians & Surgeons of Mumbai in India . The intercollegiate FRCS examinations are administered by two committees , the JCIE ( Joint Committee on Intercollegiate Examinations , which handles domestic examinations ) and the JSCFE ( Joint Surgical Colleges Fellowship Examination , which handles overseas examinations ) . This system replaced the earlier one in which each college administered its own examinations . First the curricula were intercollegiately coordinated by the ISCP ( Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme ) of the JCST ( Joint Committee on Surgical Training ) , and then the examinations became intercollegiate . The original fellowship was available in general surgery and in certain specialties - ophthalmic or ENT surgery , or obstetrics and gynaecology - which were not indicated in the initials . It came to be taken midway through training . Each of the four Royal Colleges of Surgeons of the UK and Ireland used to administer its own examinations . The four postnominals were FRCS ( Eng ) , FRCS ( Ed ) , FRCS ( G ) , and FRCS ( I ) . The FRCS designation without further specification then referred by convention/tradition to FRCS ( Eng ) specifically .",

  "/wiki/Mechanical_engineer": "Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies engineering physics , engineering mathematics , and materials science principles to design , analyze , manufacture , and maintain mechanical systems . It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines . The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics , dynamics , thermodynamics , materials science , structural analysis , and electricity . In addition to these core principles , mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design ( CAD ) , computer-aided manufacturing ( CAM ) , and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants , industrial equipment and machinery , heating and cooling systems , transport systems , aircraft , watercraft , robotics , medical devices , weapons , and others . It is the branch of engineering that involves the design , production , and operation of machinery . Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century ; however , its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world . In the 19th century , developments in physics led to the development of mechanical engineering science . The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements ; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as composites , mechatronics , and nanotechnology . It also overlaps with aerospace engineering , metallurgical engineering , civil engineering , electrical engineering , manufacturing engineering , chemical engineering , industrial engineering , and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts . Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of biomedical engineering , specifically with biomechanics , transport phenomena , biomechatronics , bionanotechnology , and modelling of biological systems ."
