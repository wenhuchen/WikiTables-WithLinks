For the next 50 years , workers in Ybor City 's cigar factories rolled hundreds of millions of cigars annually . Ybor City was unique in the American South as a successful town almost entirely populated and owned by immigrants . The neighborhood had features unusual among contemporary communities in the south , most notably its multi-ethnic and multi-racial population and their many mutual aid societies . The cigar industry employed thousands of well-paid workers , helping Tampa grow from an economically depressed village to a bustling city in about 20 years and giving it the nickname Cigar City . Ybor City grew and flourished from the 1890s until the Great Depression of the 1930s , when a drop in demand for fine cigars reduced the number of cigar factories and mechanization in the cigar industry greatly reduced employment opportunities in the neighborhood . This process accelerated after World War II , and a steady exodus of residents and businesses continued until large areas of the formerly vibrant neighborhood were virtually abandoned by the late 1970s . Attempts at redevelopment failed until the 1980s , when an influx of artists began a slow process of gentrification . In the 1990s and early 2000s , a portion of the original neighborhood around 7th Avenue developed into a night club and entertainment district , and many old buildings were renovated for new uses . Since then , the area 's economy has diversified with more offices and residences , and the population has shown notable growth for the first time in over half a century .
