Though the group rejects these labels , its members have expressed admiration for the former Greek dictators Ioannis Metaxas of the 4th of August Regime ( 1936-1941 ) and Georgios Papadopoulos of the Regime of the Colonels ( 1967-1974 ) . They have also made use of alleged Nazi symbolism , and have praised figures of Nazi Germany in the past . According to academic sources , the group is racist and xenophobic , and the party 's leader has openly identified it as nationalist and racist . Nikolaos Michaloliakos began the foundations of what would become Golden Dawn in 1980 , when he published the first issue of the right-wing , pro-military junta journal with that name . In this context , Golden Dawn had its origins in the movement that worked towards a return to right-wing military dictatorship in Greece . Following an investigation into the 2013 murder of Pavlos Fyssas , an anti-fascist rapper , by a supporter of the party , Michaloliakos and several other Golden Dawn MPs and members were arrested and held in pre-trial detention on suspicion of forming a criminal organization . The trial began on 20 April 2015 and is ongoing as of 2019 [ update ] . Golden Dawn later lost all of its remaining seats in the Greek Parliament in the 2019 Greek legislative election ."
