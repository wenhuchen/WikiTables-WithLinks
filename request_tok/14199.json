  "/wiki/United_States_dollar": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",
  "/wiki/Cabri_Geometry": "Cabri Geometry is a commercial interactive geometry software produced by the French company Cabrilog for teaching and learning geometry and trigonometry . It was designed with ease-of-use in mind . The program allows the user to animate geometric figures , proving a significant advantage over those drawn on a blackboard . Relationships between points on a geometric object may easily be demonstrated , which can be useful in the learning process . There are also graphing and display functions which allow exploration of the connections between geometry and algebra . The program can be run under Windows or the Mac OS .",

  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/CaRMetal": "CaRMetal is an interactive geometry program which inherited the C.a.R . engine . The software has been created by Eric Hakenholz , in Java . CaRMetal is free , under GNU GPL license . It keeps an amount of functionality of C.a.R . but uses a different graphical interface which purportedly eliminates some intermediate dialogs and provides direct access to numerous effects . Constructions are done using a main palette , which contains some useful construction shortcuts in addition to the standard compass and ruler tools . These include perpendicular bisector , circle through three points , circumcircular arc through three points , and conic section through five points . Also interesting are the loci , functions , parametric curves , and implicit plots . Element thickness , color , label , and other attributes ( including the so-called magnetic property ) can be set using a separate panel . CaRMetal also supports a configurable restricted construction palette and has assignment capabilities , which use an apparently unique feature called Monkey . CaRMetal has a scripting language ( JavaScript ) which allows the user to build rather complex figures like fractals .",

GeoGebra is available on multiple platforms with its desktop applications for Windows , macOS and Linux , with its tablet apps for Android , iPad and Windows , and with its web application based on HTML5 technology . Its creator , Markus Hohenwarter , started the project in 2001 ( as part of his master 's thesis ) at the University of Salzburg , continuing it at Florida Atlantic University ( 2006-2008 ) , Florida State University ( 2008-2009 ) , and now at the University of Linz together with the help of open-source developers and translators all over the world . After a successful Kickstarter campaign , GeoGebra expanded their offerings to include an iPad , an Android and a Windows Store app version . In 2013 , Bernard Parisse 's Giac was integrated into GeoGebra 's CAS view . GeoGebra includes both commercial and not-for-profit entities that work together from the head office in Linz , Austria , to expand the software and cloud services available to its user community .",
