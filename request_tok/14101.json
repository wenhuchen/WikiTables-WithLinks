  "/wiki/Sundial": "A sundial is a device that tells the time of day when there is sunlight by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky . In the narrowest sense of the word , it consists of a flat plate ( the dial ) and a gnomon , which casts a shadow onto the dial . As the Sun appears to move across the sky , the shadow aligns with different hour-lines , which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day . The style is the time-telling edge of the gnomon , though a single point or nodus may be used . The gnomon casts a broad shadow ; the shadow of the style shows the time . The gnomon may be a rod , wire , or elaborately decorated metal casting . The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth 's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year . The style 's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial 's geographical latitude . In a broader sense , a sundial is any device that uses the Sun 's altitude or azimuth ( or both ) to show the time . In addition to their time-telling function , sundials are valued as decorative objects , literary metaphors , and objects of intrigue and mathematical study . A rudimentary sundial can be easily constructed to mark the passing of time by placing a stick in the sand or a nail in a board and placing markers at the edge of a shadow or outlining a shadow at intervals . It is common for inexpensive , mass-produced decorative sundials to have incorrectly aligned gnomons , shadow lengths , and hour-lines , which can not be adjusted to tell correct time .",
