  "/wiki/Gene_D._Block": "Gene David Block ( born August 17 , 1948 ) is an American biologist , academic , inventor , and chancellor of the University of California , Los Angeles . He attended Stanford University for his BA , and subsequently received his MS and PhD in psychology from the University of Oregon in 1975 . Block was then provost and professor of biology at the University of Virginia . While at the University of Virginia , Block interacted with Randy Pausch and is mentioned in his memoir , The Last Lecture . Before becoming chancellor of UCLA , Block had an extensive scientific career . His early work with mollusks investigated the structure and function of basal retinal neurons ( BRN ) in circadian photoentrainment . He was the first to discover a cell-autonomous circadian pacemaker and concluded that BRNs are both necessary and sufficient for photoentrainment . Later in his career , Block explored the molecular basis of circadian rhythms in mammals , and found that calcium flux was necessary for circadian rhythmicity . His most recent research , which he is still working on today , is largely focused on the effect that aging has on the circadian clock .",
