  "section_text": "Most artillery units seem to have begun the war named for the city or county that sponsored its organization . In the Official Records , artillery units are most often referred to by the name of their battery commander . During the war , some effort was made to organize artillery units into battalions and regiments , but the units almost never functioned above the battery level , and were often broken out and fought as single gun sections . For these reasons the Arkansas artillery organizations are listed by several names . The Arkansas batteries which served primarily in the Confederate Army of Tennessee or Army of Mississippi , ( east of the Mississippi River ) were `` officially '' designated as `` _st Arkansas Light Artillery '' . On November 19 , 1864 , General E. Kirby Smith , commanding the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department , issued Special Orders No . 290 , organizing the artillery of the department into battalions , and listing the various batteries as `` _st Arkansas Field Battery '' . The component batteries rarely , if ever , operated together . They were usually assigned individually to an infantry or cavalry brigade . [ 139 ]",

  "intro": "This is a list of Arkansas Civil War Confederate Units, or military units from the state of Arkansas which fought for the Confederacy in the American Civil War. The list of Union units is shown separately. Like most states, Arkansas possessed a prewar Militia organization, which consisted of seventy one regiments, organized into eight brigades, and divided into two divisions. In addition to its standard militia regiment or regiments, each county was authorized to create up to four Volunteer Militia Companies. While none of the prewar militia regiments were enrolled into Confederate service, many of the existing Volunteer Militia Companies were enrolled into new volunteer regiments. Other new Volunteer Companies were raised with no connection to the prewar militia. Immediately following secession, the State Military Board began organizing regiments of State Troops. Many of these regiments were eventually transferred into Confederate Service. Some Volunteer Regiments were organized under direct authority of the new Confederate Government and were never organized as State Troops. In April 1862, the Confederate Congress passed a conscription law and new companies and regiments were organized almost entirely of conscripted (drafted) men. Volunteers usually went into already existing units. The secession convention also authorized each county to organize Home Guard units made up of men too young or too old or otherwise exempt from conscription or militia service."
