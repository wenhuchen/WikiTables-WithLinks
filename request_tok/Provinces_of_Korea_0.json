  "/wiki/Japanese_language": "Japanese ( \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e , Nihongo [ \u0272iho\u014b\u0261o ] ( listen ) ) is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people , primarily in Japan , where it is the national language . It is a member of the Japonic ( or Japanese-Ryukyuan ) language family , and its relation to other languages , such as Korean , is debated . Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu , Austroasiatic , and the now-discredited Altaic , but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance . Little is known of the language 's prehistory , or when it first appeared in Japan . Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words , but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century . During the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) , Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese . Late Middle Japanese ( 1185-1600 ) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language , and the first appearance of European loanwords . The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo ( modern Tokyo ) region in the Early Modern Japanese period ( early 17th century-mid-19th century ) . Following the end of Japan 's self-imposed isolation in 1853 , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly . English loanwords , in particular , have become frequent , and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated . Japanese is an agglutinative , mora-timed language with simple phonotactics , a pure vowel system , phonemic vowel and consonant length , and a lexically significant pitch-accent . Word order is normally subject-object-verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words , and sentence structure is topic-comment .",
  "/wiki/Kana": "Kana ( \u4eee\u540d , Japanese pronunciation : [ kana ] ) are the syllabaries that form parts of the Japanese writing system , contrasted with the logographic Chinese characters known in Japan as kanji ( \u6f22\u5b57 ) . The modern Japanese writing system makes use of two syllabaries : cursive hiragana ( \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a ) and angular katakana ( \u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca ) . Also classified as kana is the ancient syllabic use of kanji known as man'y\u014dgana ( \u4e07\u8449\u4eee\u540d ) , which was ancestral to both hiragana and katakana . Hentaigana ( \u5909\u4f53\u4eee\u540d , variant kana ) are historical variants of modern standard hiragana . In modern Japanese , hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding sets of characters representing the same series of sounds . Katakana , with a few additions , are also used to write Ainu . Taiwanese kana were used in Taiwanese Hokkien as glosses ( furigana ) for Chinese characters in Taiwan under Japanese rule . Each kana character ( syllabogram ) corresponds to one sound in the Japanese language . Apart from the five vowels , this is always CV ( consonant onset with vowel nucleus ) , such as ka , ki , etc. , or V ( vowel ) , such as a , i , etc. , with the sole exception of the C grapheme for nasal codas usually romanised as n. This structure has led some scholars to label the system moraic instead of syllabic , because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda ( i.e . CVn , CVm , CVng ) , a CVV syllable with complex nucleus ( i.e . multiple or expressively long vowels ) , or a CCV syllable with complex onset ( i.e . including a glide , CyV , CwV ) .",

More specifically , it refers to the Chinese characters borrowed from Chinese and incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation . Hanja-mal or Hanja-eo ( the latter is used more often ) refers to words that can be written with Hanja , and hanmun , or anyone who wishes to read scholarly texts in the humanities . Learning a certain number of Hanja is very helpful for understanding the etymology of Sino-Korean words , and for enlarging one 's Korean vocabulary . Today , Hanja are not used to write native Korean words , which are always rendered in Hangul , and even words of Chinese origin - Hanja-eo ( \ud55c\uc790\uc5b4 , \u6f22\u5b57\u8a9e ) - are written with the Hangul alphabet most of the time , with the corresponding Chinese character often written next to it to prevent confusion with other characters or words with the same phonetics .

  "/wiki/Korean_language": "The Korean language ( South Korean : \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4/\u97d3\u570b\u8a9e hanguk-eo ; North Korean : \uc870\uc120\ub9d0/\u671d\u9bae\ub9d0 chos\u014fn-mal ) is an East Asian language spoken by about 77 million people . It is a member of the Koreanic language family and is the official and national language of both Koreas : North Korea and South Korea , with different standardized official forms used in each country . It is a recognised minority language in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County of Jilin province , China . It is also spoken in parts of Sakhalin , Russia , and Central Asia . Historical and modern linguists classify Korean as a language isolate ; however , it does have a few extinct relatives , which together with Korean itself and the Jeju language ( spoken in the Jeju Province and considered somewhat distinct ) form the Koreanic language family . The linguistic homeland of Korean is suggested to be somewhere in Manchuria .",
  "/wiki/Hangul": "The Korean alphabet , known as Hangul ( Hangeul ) [ note 1 ] in South Korea or Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl in North Korea , has been used to write the Korean language since its creation in the 15th century by King Sejong the Great . It is the official writing system of Korea , both South Korea and North Korea . It is a co-official writing system in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County in Jilin Province , China . It is also sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of Baubau , Indonesia . A Taiwanese linguist Xu Caode ( 1987 ) developed and used a modified Hangul alphabet to represent spoken Taiwanese Hokkien , and was later supported by Ang Ui-jin ( see Taiwanese Hangul ) . The Hangul alphabet originally consisted of 28 letters with 17 consonant letters and 11 vowel letters when it was created . As four became obsolete , modern Hangul consists of a total of 24 letters with 14 consonant letters and 10 vowel letters . In North Korea the total is counted 40 . It consists of 19 consonant letters and 21 vowel letters as it additionally includes 5 tense consonants ( \u3132 \u3138 \u3143 \u3149 \u3146 ) and 6 compound and complex vowel letters as well as \u3150 and \u3154 . The Korean letters are written in syllabic blocks with the alphabetic letters arranged in two dimensions . For example , the Korean word for honeybee ( kkulbeol ) is written \uafc0\ubc8c , not \u3132\u315c\u3139\u3142\u3153\u3139 . As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing systems , it has been described as an alphabetic syllabary by some linguists .",
