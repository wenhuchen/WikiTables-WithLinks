Born in Mission , Texas , Bentsen graduated from the University of Texas School of Law before serving in the Air Force during World War II . He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service in Europe . After the war , he won election to the United States House of Representatives , serving from 1948 to 1955 .

He was reelected in 1976 , 1982 , and 1988 , and served as the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from 1987 to 1993 . In the Senate , he helped win passage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and played a role in the creation of the individual retirement account . Bentsen sought the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination but was unable to organize an effective national campaign . Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis chose Bentsen as his running mate in the 1988 presidential election , while the Republicans nominated Vice President George H. W. Bush and Senator Dan Quayle . During the 1988 vice-presidential debate , Quayle responded to a question about his inexperience by comparing his time in office up to that point to that of John F. Kennedy , causing Bentsen to castigate Quayle , saying , Senator , you 're no Jack Kennedy . Though Dukakis hoped that the selection of Bentsen would help the Democratic ticket win Texas , the Republican ticket won the state and prevailed by a wide margin in the nationwide electoral and popular vote .",

  "/wiki/Paleoanthropology": "Paleoanthropology or paleo-anthropology is a branch of paleontology with a human focus , which seeks to understand the early development of anatomically modern humans , a process known as hominization , through the reconstruction of evolutionary kinship lines within the family Hominidae , working from biological evidence ( such as petrified skeletal remains , bone fragments , footprints ) and cultural evidence ( such as stone tools , artifacts , and settlement localities ) . The field draws from and combines paleontology , biological anthropology , and cultural anthropology . As technologies and methods advance , genetics plays an ever-increasing role , in particular to examine and compare DNA structure as a vital tool of research of the evolutionary kinship lines of related species and genera .",

  "/wiki/Archaeology": "Archaeology , or archeology , is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture . The archaeological record consists of artifacts , architecture , biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes . Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities . In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines , while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology . Archaeologists study human prehistory and history , from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades . Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology , which is the study of fossil remains . It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies , for whom there may be no written records to study . Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past , from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world . Archaeology has various goals , which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time . The discipline involves surveying , excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past . In broad scope , archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research . It draws upon anthropology , history , art history , classics , ethnology , geography , geology , literary history , linguistics , semiology , sociology , textual criticism , physics , information sciences , chemistry , statistics , paleoecology , paleography , paleontology , paleozoology , and paleobotany .",

  "/wiki/Progeria": "Progeria is an extremely rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder in which symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at a very early age . Progeria is one of several progeroid syndromes . Those born with progeria typically live to their mid-teens to early twenties . It is a genetic condition that occurs as a new mutation , and is rarely inherited , as carriers usually do not live to reproduce children . Although the term progeria applies strictly speaking to all diseases characterized by premature aging symptoms , and is often used as such , it is often applied specifically in reference to Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome ( HGPS ) . Progeria was first described in 1886 by Jonathan Hutchinson . It was also described independently in 1897 by Hastings Gilford . The condition was later named Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome . The word progeria comes from the Greek words pro ( \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc ) , meaning before or premature , and g\u0113ras ( \u03b3\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 ) , meaning old age . Scientists are interested in progeria partly because it might reveal clues about the normal process of aging ."
