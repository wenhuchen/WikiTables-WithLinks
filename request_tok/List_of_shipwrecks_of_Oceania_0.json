It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands .

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

On 9 November 1769 , Cook landed on the shores of the bay to observe a Transit of Mercury . In 1919 , an area of land around Shakespeare Cliff was set aside , and a small memorial was constructed , based on the erroneous notion that it was the location of Cook 's observations . But the actual site of Cook 's landing and observation was the eastern end of Cook 's Beach , near the Purangi estuary . A smaller memorial plinth was established there also .

  "/wiki/Frigate": "A frigate ( /\u02c8fr\u026a\u0261\u0259t/ ) is a type of warship , having various sizes and roles over time . In the 17th century , a frigate was any warship built for speed and maneuverability , the description often used being frigate-built . These could be warships carrying their principal batteries of carriage-mounted guns on a single deck or on two decks ( with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel ) . The term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the line of battle , although early line-of-battle ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed . In the 18th century , frigates were full-rigged ships , that is square-rigged on all three masts , they were built for speed and handiness , had a lighter armament than a ship of the line , and were used for patrolling and escort . In the definition adopted by the British Admiralty , they were rated ships of at least 28 guns , carrying their principal armaments upon a single continuous deck - the upper deck - while ships of the line possessed two or more continuous decks bearing batteries of guns . In the late 19th century ( beginning about 1858 with the construction of prototypes by the British and French navies ) , the armoured frigate was a type of ironclad warship that for a time was the most powerful type of vessel afloat . The term frigate was used because such ships still mounted their principal armaments on a single continuous upper deck . In modern navies , frigates are used to protect other warships and merchant-marine ships , especially as anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces , underway replenishment groups , and merchant convoys . Ship classes dubbed frigates have also more closely resembled corvettes , destroyers , cruisers and even battleships . Some European navies such as the Dutch , French , German or Spanish ones use the term frigate for both their destroyers and frigates .

Beyond Caroline Bay , the industrial suburb of Washdyke is at a major junction with State Highway 8 , the main route into the Mackenzie Country . This provides a road link to Pleasant Point , Fairlie , Twizel , Lake Tekapo , Aoraki / Mount Cook and Queenstown . Timaru has been built on rolling hills created from the lava flows of the extinct Mt Horrible volcano , which last erupted thousands of years ago . The result is that most of the main streets are undulating , a clear contrast with the flat landscape of the Canterbury Plains to the north . This volcanic rock is used for the construction of local bluestone buildings .",

  "/wiki/MV_Kaitawa": "The MV Kaitawa was 2485 ton collier owned by the Union Steamship Company . She was lost with all hands on 24 May 1966 near Cape Reinga , New Zealand .",
  "/wiki/Collier_(ship)": "A collier is a bulk cargo ship designed to carry coal , especially for naval use by coal-fired warships . Coaling at sea was critical to navies and speed of coal transfer was an important metric of naval efficiency . In 1883 , forty tons an hour was considered fast and it would take over twelve hours to restock half the bunkers of a typical ship , HMS Collingwood .",
  "/wiki/Cape_Reinga": "Cape Reinga /ri\u02c8\u00e6\u014b\u0259/ ( M\u0101ori : Te Rerenga Wairua ) is the northwesternmost tip of the Aupouri Peninsula , at the northern end of the North Island of New Zealand . Cape Reinga is more than 100 km north of the nearest small town of Kaitaia . State Highway 1 extends all the way to the cape , but until 2010 was unsealed gravel road for the last 19 km . Suitable vehicles can also travel much of the way via Ninety Mile Beach and Kauaeparaoa Stream ( Te Paki Stream ) stream bed . The 'Te Rerenga Wairua ' component of the name in M\u0101ori language means the leaping-off place of spirits . The 'Reinga ' part of the name is the M\u0101ori language word meaning the underworld . Both refer to the M\u0101ori belief that the cape is the point where the spirits of the dead enter the underworld . Cape Reinga is on the tentative list of UNESCO waiting to receive World Heritage Site status . The cape is already a favourite tourist attraction , with over 120,000 visitors a year and around 1,300 cars arriving per day during peak season . Visitor numbers are growing by about five percent a year , and the increase is likely to become even more now that the road to the cape is fully sealed .",

  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",
  "/wiki/Passenger_liner": "A passenger ship is a merchant ship whose primary function is to carry passengers on the sea . The category does not include cargo vessels which have accommodations for limited numbers of passengers , such as the ubiquitous twelve-passenger freighters once common on the seas in which the transport of passengers is secondary to the carriage of freight . The type does however include many classes of ships designed to transport substantial numbers of passengers as well as freight . Indeed , until recently virtually all ocean liners were able to transport mail , package freight and express , and other cargo in addition to passenger luggage , and were equipped with cargo holds and derricks , kingposts , or other cargo-handling gear for that purpose . Only in more recent ocean liners and in virtually all cruise ships has this cargo capacity been eliminated . While typically passenger ships are part of the merchant marine , passenger ships have also been used as troopships and often are commissioned as naval ships when used as for that purpose .",
  "/wiki/Marlborough_Sounds": "The Marlborough Sounds are an extensive network of sea-drowned valleys at the northern end of the South Island of New Zealand . The Marlborough Sounds were created by a combination of land subsidence and rising sea levels . According to M\u0101ori mythology , the sounds are the prows of the sunken wakas of Aoraki .",
  "/wiki/RMS_Niagara": "A Melbourne company , United Propriety Salvage Ltd , was promptly contracted to recover the gold . At the time it was one of the deepest salvage operations ever undertaken . The salvage team was led by Captain J. P. Williams and John Edwards Johnstone on the ship Claymore . The Claymore , built in 1902 , 260 tons gross , was an old coastal steamship . When first cited for the salvage job she was a hulk rusting on the banks of Auckland Harbour . Before recovering any gold the Claymore had to be salvaged herself . Once Claymore had been restored to working order , the salvage team based themselves out of Whangarei and began operations on 15 December 1940 . It took Claymore about two months to find the wreck , which it did by dragging its anchor along the seabed , and minefield . Twice during the search she fouled unexploded mines and was nearly sunk . On 2 February 1941 the wreck of the Niagara was found and the salvage team started the arduous and hazardous task of retrieving the gold for HM Treasury . They had only rudimentary equipment , a viewing/diving chamber , radio , and a grab lowered from the surface . Williams and his team blasted a hole in Niagara 's hull and successfully recovered 555 gold bars : more than eight tonnes and 94% of the total .",
  "/wiki/Ocean_liner": "An ocean liner is a passenger ship primarily used as a form of transportation across seas or oceans . Liners may also carry cargo or mail , and may sometimes be used for other purposes ( such as for pleasure cruises or as hospital ships ) . Cargo vessels running to a schedule are sometimes called liners . The category does not include ferries or other vessels engaged in short-sea trading , nor dedicated cruise ships where the voyage itself , and not transportation , is the prime purpose of the trip . Nor does it include tramp steamers , even those equipped to handle limited numbers of passengers . Some shipping companies refer to themselves as lines and their container ships , which often operate over set routes according to established schedules , as liners . Ocean liners are usually strongly built with a high freeboard to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean . Additionally , they are often designed with thicker hull plating than is found on cruise ships , and have large capacities for fuel , food and other consumables on long voyages . The first ocean liners were built in the mid-19th century . Technological innovations such as the steam engine and steel hull allowed larger and faster liners to be built , giving rise to a competition between world powers of the time , especially between the United Kingdom and Germany . Once the dominant form of travel between continents , ocean liners were rendered largely obsolete by the emergence of long-distance aircraft after World War II . Advances in automobile and railway technology also played a role .",

The Hen and Chicken Islands are located off the headland at a distance of 12 kilometres . Bream Head features a prominent bluff 490 metres in height , the remains of a Miocene andesitic volcano . It forms the northern extremity of Bream Bay , and guards the entrance to Whangarei Harbour , a natural inlet extending to the northwest . The Marsden Point Oil Refinery is located on the opposing shore of the harbour five kilometres to the west . Immediately to the north of Bream Head is a long sandy beach called Ocean Beach .",
  "/wiki/Bank_of_England": "The Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based . Established in 1694 to act as the English Government 's banker , and still one of the bankers for the Government of the United Kingdom , it is the world 's eighth-oldest bank . It was privately owned by stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until it was nationalised in 1946 . The Bank became an independent public organisation in 1998 , wholly owned by the Treasury Solicitor on behalf of the government , but with independence in setting monetary policy . The Bank is one of eight banks authorised to issue banknotes in the United Kingdom , has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales and regulates the issue of banknotes by commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland . The Bank 's Monetary Policy Committee has a devolved responsibility for managing monetary policy . The Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances , but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days . The Bank 's Financial Policy Committee held its first meeting in June 2011 as a macroprudential regulator to oversee regulation of the UK 's financial sector . The Bank 's headquarters have been in London 's main financial district , the City of London , on Threadneedle Street , since 1734 . It is sometimes known as The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street , a name taken from a satirical cartoon by James Gillray in 1797 . The road junction outside is known as Bank junction . As a regulator and central bank , the Bank of England has not offered consumer banking services for many years , but it still does manage some public-facing services such as exchanging superseded bank notes .",
  "/wiki/HMS_Orpheus_(1860)": "HMS Orpheus was a Jason-class Royal Navy corvette that served as the flagship of the Australian squadron . Orpheus sank off the west coast of Auckland , New Zealand on 7 February 1863 : 189 crew out of the ship 's complement of 259 died in the disaster , making it the worst maritime tragedy to occur in New Zealand waters .",
  "/wiki/Jason-class_corvette": "The Jason-class corvette was a type of wooden screw corvette made between 1859 and 1863 . There were a total of seven ships of this class made by the authorization of the Royal Navy .",
  "/wiki/Corvette": "A corvette is a small warship . It is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper ( or rated ) warship . The warship class above the corvette is that of the frigate , while the class below was historically that of the sloop-of-war . The modern types of ship below a corvette are coastal patrol craft , missile boat and fast attack craft . In modern terms , a corvette is typically between 500 tons and 2,000 tons , although recent designs may approach 3,000 tons , which might instead be considered a small frigate . The word corvette is first found in Middle French , a diminutive of the Dutch word corf , meaning a small ship , from the Latin corbis , meaning basket . The rank corvette captain , equivalent in many navies to lieutenant commander , derives from the name of this type of ship . The rank is the most junior of three captain ranks in several European ( e.g. , France , Spain , Italy , Croatia ) and South American ( e.g. , Argentina , Chile ) navies , because a corvette , as the smallest class of rated warship , was traditionally the smallest class of vessel entitled to a commander of a captain rank .",
  "/wiki/Manukau_Heads": "The Manukau Heads is the name given to the two promontories that form the entrance to the Manukau Harbour - one of the two harbours of Auckland in New Zealand . The southern head , at the northern tip of Awhitu Peninsula , is simply termed The South Head , whereas the northern head is named Burnett Head ( the term North Head is used to indicate a promontory in the nearby Waitemat\u0101 Harbour ) . Both heads are hilly areas of land that rise steeply from the water to over 240m within less than 400m of the shoreline . [ citation needed ] There is a pronounced sand bar across the harbour mouth which has limited shipping into the harbour since European vessels arrived in the area which had enough draught to be affected by such shallows . This limitation ( which ensured an effective maximum ship size of about 1,000 tons in pre-modern times ) , was no barrier to early success of shipping to local ports in the harbour - but eventually meant that the Waitemat\u0101 Harbour overtook the Manukau Harbour in prominence as a port location . New Zealand 's worst maritime disaster occurred just offshore in 1863 when HMS Orpheus ran aground on the Manukau Bar and sank with the loss of 189 lives . The area remains dangerous for watercraft , with one death each in 2005 and 2010 when pleasure craft capsized or were swamped near the bar . The Manukau Harbour Bar was first crossed in a surf boat by a crew from Piha Surf Life Saving Club who rowed from Onehunga to Piha in over five hours in high swells and stiff winds in 1992 . A crew from Piha had attempted this row in 1971 but was caught out by rising swells closing out the northern channel and after attempting to catch a smaller wave into the beach lost their boat when it was smashed on to the beach by a dumping wave .",

The tiny settlement of Puponga stands close to the western ( landward ) end of the spit . It forms the northern side of Golden Bay and is the longest sandspit in New Zealand , stretching for about 26 km above sea level and another 6 km underwater . The spit runs in from west to east , and is made from fine golden sand - as Cape Farewell to the west of the spit is mostly composed of late Cretaceous quartz sandstones , i.e . silica but with traces of other heavy minerals , garnet , ilmenite , magnetite and pyroxene . The erosion of the cliffs into fine sand carried on the sea currents creates Farewell spit further east . The northern side of the dunes are steeper and unstable being constantly exposed to the prevailing winds which average over 25 km/h . The southern side which faces Golden Bay is more stable and largely covered with vegetation . The tide here can recede as much as seven kilometres exposing some 80 square kilometres of mud flats ; a rich feeding ground for the many seabirds in the area but also a trap for frequently stranded whales .",
