  "/wiki/Book_of_Mormon": "The Book of Mormon is a sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement , which , according to adherents , contains writings of ancient prophets who lived on the American continent from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421 . It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as The Book of Mormon : An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi . According to Smith 's account and the book 's narrative , the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as reformed Egyptian engraved on golden plates . Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book , a man named Moroni , buried it in the Hill Cumorah in present-day Manchester , New York before his death , and then returned to Earth in 1827 as an angel , revealing the location of the plates to Smith , and instructing him to translate the plates into English for use in the restoration of Christ 's true church in the latter days . Critics claim that it was authored by Smith , drawing on material and ideas from contemporary 19th-century works rather than translating an ancient record . The Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve , the nature of the Christian atonement , eschatology , redemption from physical and spiritual death , and the organization of the latter-day church . The pivotal event of the book is an appearance of Jesus Christ in the Americas shortly after his resurrection . The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the unique writings of the Latter-day Saint movement , the denominations of which typically regard the text primarily as scripture , and secondarily as a historical record of God 's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas . The archaeological , historical , and scientific communities do not accept the Book of Mormon as an ancient record of actual historical events . The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books , titled after the individuals named as primary authors and , in most versions , divided into chapters and verses . It is written in English very similar to the Early Modern English linguistic style of the King James Version of the Bible , and has since been fully or partially translated into 111 languages . As of 2011 , more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon had been printed .",
