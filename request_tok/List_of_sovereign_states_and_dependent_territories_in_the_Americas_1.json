The archipelago , with an area of 4,700 square miles ( 12,000 square kilometres ) , comprises East Falkland , West Falkland and 776 smaller islands . As a British overseas territory , the Falklands have internal self-governance , and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs . The Falkland Islands ' capital is Stanley on East Falkland . Controversy exists over the Falklands ' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans . At various times , the islands have had French , British , Spanish , and Argentine settlements . Britain reasserted its rule in 1833 , but Argentina maintains its claim to the islands . In April 1982 , Argentine military forces invaded the islands . British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War .

Also , minor Danish-speaking communities are found in Norway , Sweden , Spain , the United States , Canada , Brazil , and Argentina . Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas , around 15-20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language . Along with the other North Germanic languages , Danish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Danish , together with Swedish , derives from the East Norse dialect group , while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic . A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish as mainland Scandinavian , while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as insular Scandinavian . Until the 16th century , Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions . With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing , a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect . It spread through use in the education system and administration , though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century . Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden , a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity , and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity , with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries . Today , traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared , though regional variants of the standard language exist .

The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue .

  "/wiki/Spanish_language": "Spanish ( /\u02c8sp\u00e6n\u026a\u0283/ ( listen ) ; espa\u00f1ol ( help\u00b7info ) ) , or Castilian ( /k\u00e6\u02c8st\u026ali\u0259n/ ( listen ) , castellano ( help\u00b7info ) ) , is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula and today has over 483 million native speakers , mainly in Spain and the Americas . It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",
