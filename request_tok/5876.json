  "/wiki/GAA_county": "A Gaelic Athletic Association county is a geographic region within the Gaelic Athletic Association ( GAA ) , controlled by a county board and originally based on the 32 counties of Ireland as they were in 1884 . While the administrative geography of Ireland has since changed , with several new counties created and the six that make up Northern Ireland superseded by 11 local government districts , the GAA counties have remained largely unchanged . However , the GAA county does not always and everywhere cover precisely the same territory as the traditional county . Particularly in the first 50 years of the Association but also in more recent times , there are many examples of clubs based in one of the administrative counties being allowed to participate in the leagues or championships of a neighbouring county . There are also instances where the official county boundary does not coincide precisely with the GAA county , for example where a club is based on a parish that crosses the county border . While in most cases the name of the GAA county is the same as that of the current or former administrative county , there have been exceptions : Derry has never used the official county name of Londonderry , and the Board of the county then officially known as Queen 's County changed its name in 1907 to Leix and Ossary , later becoming Laois . Each county board is responsible for organising GAA club fixtures within the county , and for the promotion and development of Gaelic games and the other objectives of the Association . The GAA county can also refer to the inter-county teams fielded by each county board . While in general any GAA county , and only a county , is eligible to compete in the provincial and national championships and leagues , and almost all do so , again there can be anomalies : in the National Hurling League , for example , a team representing Fingal - a sub-region of the GAA county of Dublin , corresponding to the modern administrative county of Fingal - competes against GAA counties . Since the inception of the county system , there have been changes to the respective regions of control of the overseas units . In Ireland the concept of the county is very strong and changing the county boundary is extremely controversial . In 2002 a proposal to divide Dublin in two was quickly and strongly opposed .",
  "/wiki/GAA_provincial_council": "Provincial councils are organisational bodies within the Gaelic Athletic Association , each made up of several GAA counties . The provincial council is responsible for the organisation of club and inter-county competitions such as the provincial championships , and the promotion of Gaelic games within their region . There are five provincial councils in the GAA , four in Ireland ( Connacht , Leinster , Munster , Ulster ) and one in Britain . The ultimate goal of the European county board is to become a provincial council .",

  "/wiki/Munster_Senior_Hurling_Championship": "The Munster GAA Hurling Senior Championship , known simply as the Munster Championship , is an annual inter-county hurling competition organised by the Munster Council of the Gaelic Athletic Association ( GAA ) . It is the highest inter-county hurling competition in the province of Munster , and has been contested every year since the 1888 championship . The final , usually held on the first Sunday in July , serves as the culmination of a series of games played during May and June , and the results determine which team receives the Munster Cup . The championship was previously played on a straight knockout basis whereby once a team lost they were eliminated from the championship , however , as of 2018 the championship will use a round-robin system . The Munster Championship is an integral part of the wider GAA Hurling All-Ireland Senior Championship . The winners of the Munster final , like their counterparts in the Leinster Championship , are rewarded by advancing directly to the semi-final stage of the All-Ireland series of games . The losers of the Munster final enter the All-Ireland series at the quarter-final stage , while the third-placed team advances to the preliminary quarter-finals . Five teams currently participate in the Munster Championship . Two of the most successful teams in hurling , namely Cork and Tipperary , play their provincial hurling in the Munster Championship . Between them , these teams have won the provincial title on 92 occasions while they have also claimed 56 All-Ireland titles .

It is one of the constituent counties of Munster GAA . Cork is one of the few 'dual counties ' in Ireland , competing in a similar level in both Gaelic football and hurling . As of the end of the 2015 National Leagues , Cork compete in the top division of both sports . However , despite both teams competing at the top level of the game for most of the county 's history , the hurling team has experienced more success , winning the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 30 times . By comparison , Cork has only won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship seven times . Traditionally football is strongest in the western half of the county , with the O'Donovan Rossa club of Skibbereen the only Cork team from outside the city to have an All-Ireland Club Football title . Hurling is the dominant sport in the east , with teams such as Sarsfields and Midleton having won Cork 's club championship multiple times . Naturally , there are exceptions to this rule of thumb , with hurling pockets in football areas and vice versa . One example is Fermoy in east Cork , which has seven Cork football titles to its name . The city of Cork traditionally has strong teams in both sports , with Nemo Rangers being the record-holders for All-Ireland Club Football Championships won , and Blackrock having three All-Ireland Club Hurling titles . As well as this , the St Finbarr 's club in the city has eight Cork football titles and 25 in hurling .",
