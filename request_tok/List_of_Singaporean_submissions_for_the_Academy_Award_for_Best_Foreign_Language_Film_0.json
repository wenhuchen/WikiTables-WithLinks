  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",
  "/wiki/Cantonese": "Cantonese is a variety of Chinese originating from the city of Guangzhou ( also known as Canton ) and its surrounding area in Southeastern China . It is the traditional prestige variety of the Yue Chinese dialect group , which has about 68 million native speakers . While the term Cantonese specifically refers to the prestige variety , it is often used to refer to the entire Yue subgroup of Chinese , including related but largely mutually unintelligible languages and dialects such as Taishanese . Cantonese is viewed as a vital and inseparable part of the cultural identity for its native speakers across large swaths of Southeastern China , Hong Kong , and Macau , as well as in overseas communities . In mainland China , it is the lingua franca of the province of Guangdong ( being the majority language of the Pearl River Delta ) and neighbouring areas such as Guangxi . It is the dominant and regional language of Hong Kong and Macau . Cantonese is also widely spoken amongst Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia ( most notably in Vietnam and Malaysia , as well as in Singapore and Cambodia to a lesser extent ) and throughout the Western world . Although Cantonese shares much vocabulary with Mandarin , the two varieties are mutually unintelligible because of differences in pronunciation , grammar , and lexicon . Sentence structure , in particular the placement of verbs , sometimes differs between the two varieties . A notable difference between Cantonese and Mandarin is how the spoken word is written ; both can be recorded verbatim , but very few Cantonese speakers are knowledgeable in the full Cantonese written vocabulary , so a non-verbatim formalized written form is adopted , which is more akin to the Mandarin written form . This results in the situation in which a Cantonese and a Mandarin text may look similar but are pronounced differently .",

Hokkien historically served as the lingua franca amongst overseas Chinese communities of all dialects and subgroups in Southeast Asia , and remains today as the most spoken variety of Chinese in the region , including in Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , Philippines and some parts of Indochina ( particularly Thailand , Laos and Cambodia ) .

It is a member of the Japonic ( or Japanese-Ryukyuan ) language family , and its relation to other languages , such as Korean , is debated . Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu , Austroasiatic , and the now-discredited Altaic , but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance . Little is known of the language 's prehistory , or when it first appeared in Japan . Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words , but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century . During the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) , Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese . Late Middle Japanese ( 1185-1600 ) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language , and the first appearance of European loanwords . The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo ( modern Tokyo ) region in the Early Modern Japanese period ( early 17th century-mid-19th century ) . Following the end of Japan 's self-imposed isolation in 1853 , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly . English loanwords , in particular , have become frequent , and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated . Japanese is an agglutinative , mora-timed language with simple phonotactics , a pure vowel system , phonemic vowel and consonant length , and a lexically significant pitch-accent . Word order is normally subject-object-verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words , and sentence structure is topic-comment .",

Currently , most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups , based on often superficial phonetic developments , of which the most populous by far is Mandarin ( about 800 million speakers , e.g .

A language of the Malays , it is spoken by 290 million people across the Strait of Malacca , including the coasts of the Malay Peninsula of Malaysia and the eastern coast of Sumatra in Indonesia and has been established as a native language of part of western coastal Sarawak and West Kalimantan in Borneo . It is also used as a trading language in the southern Philippines , including the southern parts of the Zamboanga Peninsula , the Sulu Archipelago and the southern predominantly Muslim-inhabited municipalities of Bataraza and Balabac in Palawan . As the Bahasa Kebangsaan or Bahasa Nasional ( national language ) of several states , Standard Malay has various official names . In Malaysia , it is designated as either Bahasa Malaysia ( Malaysian language ) or Bahasa Melayu ( Malay language ) . In Singapore and Brunei , it is called Bahasa Melayu ( Malay language ) and in Indonesia , an autonomous normative variety called Bahasa Indonesia ( Indonesian language ) is designated the Bahasa Persatuan/Pemersatu ( unifying language/lingua franca ) . However , in areas of central to southern Sumatra where vernacular varieties of Malay are indigenous , Indonesians refer to it as Bahasa Melayu and consider it one of their regional languages . Standard Malay , also called Court Malay , was the literary standard of the pre-colonial Malacca and Johor Sultanates , and so the language is sometimes called Malacca , Johor or Riau Malay ( or various combinations of those names ) to distinguish it from the various other Malayan languages . According to Ethnologue 16 , several of the Malayan varieties they currently list as separate languages , including the Orang Asli varieties of Peninsular Malay , are so closely related to standard Malay that they may prove to be dialects . There are also several Malay trade and creole languages which are based on a lingua franca derived from Classical Malay as well as Macassar Malay , which appears to be a mixed language .",

The group includes the Beijing dialect , the basis of Standard Chinese or Standard Mandarin . Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north , the group is sometimes referred to as the Northern dialects ( \u5317\u65b9\u8bdd ; b\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0 ) . Many local Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible . Nevertheless , Mandarin is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers ( with nearly a billion ) . Mandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups , spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area , stretching from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast . This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south , combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas . Most Mandarin varieties have four tones . The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties , but some have merged them as a final glottal stop . Many Mandarin varieties , including the Beijing dialect , retain retroflex initial consonants , which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese . The capital has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium , making these dialects very influential . Some form of Mandarin has served as a national lingua franca since the 14th century .",

It is one of 22 scheduled languages of India spoken by nearly 2.88% of Indians . Malayalam has official language status in the state of Kerala and in the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry ( Mah\u00e9 ) and is spoken by 37 million people worldwide . Malayalam is also spoken by linguistic minorities in the neighbouring states ; with significant number of speakers in the Nilgiris , Kanyakumari , and Coimbatore districts of Tamil Nadu , and Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka . Due to Malayali expatriates in the Persian Gulf , the language is also widely spoken in Gulf countries . The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars . One view holds that Malayalam and modern Tamil are offshoots of Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after the c. 7th century AD . A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of Proto-Dravidian or Proto-Tamil-Malayalam in the prehistoric era . Designated a Classical Language in India in 2013 , it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan in the 16th century . The oldest documents written purely in Malayalam and still surviving are the Vazhappalli Copper plates from 832 AD and Tharisapalli Copper plates from 849 AD . The earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu alphabet , and later the Kolezhuttu , which derived from it .",
