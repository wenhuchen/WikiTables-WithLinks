  "/wiki/Royal_Thai_General_System_of_Transcription": "The Royal Thai General System of Transcription ( RTGS ) is the official system for rendering Thai words in the Latin alphabet . It was published by the Royal Institute of Thailand . It is used in road signs and government publications and is the closest method to a standard of transcription for Thai , but its use , by even the government , is inconsistent . The system is almost identical to the one that is defined by ISO 11940-2 .",
  "/wiki/Thai_script": "The Thai script ( Thai : \u0e2d\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e23\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 ; RTGS : akson thai ) is the abugida used to write Thai , Southern Thai and many other languages spoken in Thailand . The Thai alphabet itself ( as used to write Thai ) has 44 consonant symbols ( Thai : \u0e1e\u0e22\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e30 , phayanchana ) , 16 vowel symbols ( Thai : \u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30 , sara ) that combine into at least 32 vowel forms , and four tone diacritics ( Thai : \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e01\u0e15\u0e4c or \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e15 , wannayuk or wannayut ) to create characters mostly representing syllables . Although commonly referred to as the Thai alphabet , the script is in fact not a true alphabet but an abugida , a writing system in which the full characters represent consonants with diacritical marks for vowels ; the absence of a vowel diacritic gives an implied ' a ' or ' o ' . Consonants are written horizontally from left to right , with vowels arranged above , below , to the left , or to the right of the corresponding consonant , or in a combination of positions . Thai has its own set of Thai numerals that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 , lek thai ) , but the standard western Hindu-Arabic numerals ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e01 , lek hindu arabik ) are mainly used except for government documents and the license plates of military vehicles .",

  "/wiki/Auricularia_auricula-judae": "Auricularia auricula-judae ( Latin for 'Judas 's Ear ' ) , known as the Jew 's ear , ( black ) wood ear , jelly ear or by a number of other common names , is a species of edible Auriculariales fungus found worldwide . The fruiting body is distinguished by its noticeably ear-like shape and brown colouration ; it grows upon wood , especially elder . Its specific epithet is derived from the belief that Judas Iscariot hanged himself from an elder tree ; the Latin Judae ( 'Judas's ' ) was mistranslated into English as 'Jew 's ' , leading to the term Jew 's ear , while today jelly ear and other names are sometimes used . The fungus can be found throughout the year in temperate regions worldwide , where it grows upon both dead and living wood . In the West , A. auricula-judae was used in folk medicine as recently as the 19th century for complaints including sore throats , sore eyes and jaundice , and as an astringent . Although it is not widely consumed in the West , it has long been popular in China , to the extent that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early twentieth century . Today , the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes , such as hot and sour soup , and also used in Chinese medicine . It is also used in Ghana , as a blood tonic . Modern research into possible medical applications has variously concluded that A. auricula-judae has antitumour , hypoglycemic , anticoagulant and cholesterol-lowering properties .",

  "/wiki/Termite": "Termites are eusocial insects that are classified at the taxonomic rank of infraorder Isoptera , or as epifamily Termitoidae within the cockroach order Blattodea . Termites were once classified in a separate order from cockroaches , but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that they evolved from cockroaches during the Jurassic or Triassic . However , the first termites possibly emerged during the Permian or even the Carboniferous . About 3,106 species are currently described , with a few hundred more left to be described . Although these insects are often called white ants , they are not ants . Like ants and some bees and wasps from the separate order Hymenoptera , termites divide as workers and soldiers that are usually sterile . All colonies have fertile males called kings and one or more fertile females called queens . Termites mostly feed on dead plant material and cellulose , generally in the form of wood , leaf litter , soil , or animal dung . Termites are major detritivores , particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions , and their recycling of wood and plant matter is of considerable ecological importance . Termites are among the most successful groups of insects on Earth , colonising most landmasses except Antarctica . Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals . Termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world , with some queens reportedly living up to 30 to 50 years .",

  "/wiki/Astraeus_hygrometricus": "Astraeus hygrometricus , commonly known as the hygroscopic earthstar , the barometer earthstar , or the false earthstar , is a species of fungus in the family Diplocystaceae . Young specimens resemble a puffball when unopened . In maturity , the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that is a result of the outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting open in a star-like manner . The false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees , especially in sandy soils . A. hygrometricus was previously thought to have a cosmopolitan distribution , though it is now thought to be restricted to Southern Europe , and Astraeus are common in temperate and tropical regions . Its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic ( water-absorbing ) , and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity , and close them up again in drier conditions . The rays have an irregularly cracked surface , while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top . The gleba is white initially , but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature . The spores are reddish-brown , roughly spherical with minute warts , measuring 7.5-11 micrometers in diameter . Despite a similar overall appearance , A. hygrometricus is not related to the true earthstars of genus Geastrum , although historically , they have been taxonomically confused . The species was first described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Geastrum hygrometricus . In 1885 , Andrew P. Morgan proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted the creation of a new genus Astraeus distinct from Geastrum ; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities .",

  "/wiki/Dictyophora_indusiata": "Phallus indusiatus , commonly called the bamboo mushrooms , bamboo pith , long net stinkhorn , crinoline stinkhorn or veiled lady , is a fungus in the family Phallaceae , or stinkhorns . It has a cosmopolitan distribution in tropical areas , and is found in southern Asia , Africa , the Americas , and Australia , where it grows in woodlands and gardens in rich soil and well-rotted woody material . The fruit body of the fungus is characterised by a conical to bell-shaped cap on a stalk and a delicate lacy skirt , or indusium , that hangs from beneath the cap and reaches nearly to the ground . First described scientifically in 1798 by French botanist \u00c9tienne Pierre Ventenat , the species has often been referred to a separate genus Dictyophora along with other Phallus species featuring an indusium . P. indusiatus can be distinguished from other similar species by differences in distribution , size , color , and indusium length . Mature fruit bodies are up to 25 cm ( 10 in ) tall with a conical to bell-shaped cap that is 1.5-4 cm ( 0.6-1.6 in ) wide . The cap is covered with a greenish-brown spore-containing slime , which attracts flies and other insects that eat the spores and disperse them . An edible mushroom featured as an ingredient in Chinese haute cuisine , it is used in stir-frys and chicken soups . The mushroom , grown commercially and commonly sold in Asian markets , is rich in protein , carbohydrates , and dietary fiber . The mushroom also contains various bioactive compounds , and has antioxidant and antimicrobial properties . Phallus indusiatus has a recorded history of use in Chinese medicine extending back to the 7th century AD , and features in Nigerian folklore ."
