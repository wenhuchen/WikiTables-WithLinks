The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies . It combines graphic art , characterization , cinematography , and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques .",

  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance : a play , opera , mime , ballet , etc. , performed in a theatre , or on radio or television . Considered as a genre of poetry in general , the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle 's Poetics ( c. 335 BC ) - the earliest work of dramatic theory . The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 , drama ) , which is derived from I do ( Classical Greek : \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9 , drao ) . The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy . In English ( as was the analogous case in many other European languages ) , the word play or game ( translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus ) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare 's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre . The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era . Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example , Zola 's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin ( 1873 ) or Chekhov 's Ivanov ( 1887 ) . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media . The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance . May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio . The enactment of drama in theatre , performed by actors on a stage before an audience , presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception . The structure of dramatic texts , unlike other forms of literature , is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception .",

  "/wiki/Comedy": "In a modern sense , comedy ( from the Greek : \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 , k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda ) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter , especially in theatre , television , film , stand-up comedy , books and novels or any other medium of entertainment . The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",

  "/wiki/Disaster_film": "A disaster film or disaster movie is a film genre that has an impending or ongoing disaster as its subject and primary plot device . Such disasters include natural disasters such as floods , earthquakes , tsunamis or asteroid collisions , accidents such as shipwrecks or airplane crashes , or calamities like worldwide disease pandemics . A subgenre of action films , these films usually feature some degree of build-up , the disaster itself , and sometimes the aftermath , usually from the point of view of specific individual characters or their families or portraying the survival tactics of different people . These films often feature large casts of actors and multiple plot lines , focusing on the characters ' attempts to avert , escape or cope with the disaster and its aftermath . The genre came to particular prominence during the 1970s with the release of high-profile films such as Airport ( 1970 ) , followed in quick succession by The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) , Earthquake ( 1974 ) and The Towering Inferno ( 1974 ) . The casts were generally made up of familiar character actors . Once the disaster begins in the film , the characters are usually confronted with human weaknesses , often falling in love and almost always finding a villain to blame . The films usually feature a persevering hero or heroine ( Charlton Heston , Steve McQueen , etc . ) called upon to lead the struggle against the threat . In many cases , the evil or selfish individuals are the first to succumb to the conflagration . The genre experienced a renewal in the 1990s boosted by computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) and large studio budgets which allowed for greater spectacle , culminating in the cinematic phenomenon that was James Cameron 's Titanic in 1997 .",
