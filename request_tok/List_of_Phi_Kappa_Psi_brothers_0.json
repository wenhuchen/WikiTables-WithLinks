Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the subjective theory of value , marginalism in price theory and the formulation of the economic calculation problem , each of which has become an accepted part of mainstream economics . Since the mid-20th century , mainstream economists have been critical of the modern day Austrian School and consider its rejection of mathematical modelling , econometrics and macroeconomic analysis to be outside mainstream economics , or heterodox .

As governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913 , Wilson broke with party bosses and won the passage of several progressive reforms . His success in New Jersey gave him a national reputation as a progressive reformer , and he won the presidential nomination at the 1912 Democratic National Convention .

  "/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919": "The Paris Peace Conference , also known as the Versailles Peace Conference , was the meeting in 1919 and 1920 of the victorious Allied Powers following the end of World War I to set the peace terms for the defeated Central Powers . The conference involved diplomats from 32 countries and nationalities , and its major decisions were the creation of the League of Nations , as well as the five peace treaties with the defeated states ; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as mandates , chiefly to Britain and France ; the imposition of reparations upon Germany ; and the drawing of new national boundaries ( sometimes with plebiscites ) to better reflect ethnic boundaries . The main result was the Treaty of Versailles with Germany , which in section 231 laid the guilt for the war on the aggression of Germany and her allies . This provision proved humiliating for Germany and set the stage for the expensive reparations Germany was intended to pay ( it paid only a small portion before reparations ended in 1931 ) . The five major powers ( France , Britain , Italy , Japan and the United States ) controlled the Conference . The Big Four were French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau , British Prime Minister David Lloyd George , US President Woodrow Wilson , and Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando . They met informally 145 times and made all the major decisions , which were then ratified . The conference began on 18 January 1919 . With respect to its end date , Professor Michael Neiberg has noted Although the senior statesmen stopped working personally on the conference in June 1919 , the formal peace process did not really end until July 1923 , when the Treaty of Lausanne was signed . Although it is often referred to as the Versailles Conference , only the signing of the first treaty took place at the historic palace , and the negotiations occurred at the Quai d'Orsay in Paris .",

A. Lawrence Lowell , who succeeded Eliot , further reformed the undergraduate curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard 's land holdings and physical campus .

University co-founder Ezra Cornell proposed a Department of Trade and Commerce for the new university , which was a radical departure from the day 's conventional notions about higher education , as this proposal was made sixteen years before Joseph Wharton endowed the nation 's first collegiate business school at the University of Pennsylvania . At a university faculty meeting on October 2 , 1868 , Cornell co-founder and first president Andrew Dickson White , suggested the creation of a professorship in bookkeeping in the context of a larger proposal : the creation of a commercial college . In the meantime , the Agriculture College continued to have a Department of Agricultural Economics and the Arts College continued to have a Department of Economics . Formal movements towards a business school began in 1914 , when faculty in the NYS College of Agriculture ( which today offers an undergraduate business major ) convened the first meeting of the Committee on a Commercial College . Led by economics professor Allyn Young , the committee recommended the creation of a two-year graduate course leading to the Master 's degree in both business and public administration . Young had been trained at Harvard University , and the influence on the committee 's discussion of its business school 's creation only six years prior was apparent , as the committee 's recommendations included instruction for graduate students only , selectivity in admissions , and integration into the larger university community . The idea of a business school took a backseat to World War I and its effects on the Cornell population . Following the Armistice of 1918 , third university president Jacob Gould Schurman called for the establishment of such a school , which he estimated would require $ 1 million of initial funding .
