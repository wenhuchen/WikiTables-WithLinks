The ABA was Australia 's biggest basketball competition for many years .

The association provided a high standard of competition for local basketballers from across the country as well as an intense environment for professionals to use in their off seasons . Between 1965 and 2008 , the ABA played an integral part in the development of Australian basketball with hundreds of former and active NBL and WNBL players honing their skills against world-class opposition . Many NBL and WNBL clubs also benefited from their involvement in ABA competition , including the Melbourne Tigers who competed in the SEBL before joining the NBL . In its heyday , the ABA incorporated five leagues - SEABL ( south and east conferences ) , QABL ( north conference ) , CABL ( central conference ) , Big V ( Victorian conference ) , and Waratah League ( New South Wales conference ) . With the support of Basketball Australia , the competition consistently built upon the successful structure created by the well-respected Continental Basketball Association . The end result was a culmination of over 30 years of evolution , during which time the ABA had mushroomed from eight teams in the south-east of Australia to a competition that involved 135 men 's and women 's teams based in six states and territories . The ABA was representative of the huge number of junior-based associations across the country and was the endorsed national development league of the sport 's peak body , Basketball Australia .",
