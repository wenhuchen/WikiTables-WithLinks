  "/wiki/Bremner_Historic_Mining_District": "The Bremner Historic Mining District is a historic district in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve in Alaska . It is named after John Bremner , who in 1884-1885 was the first non-native person to live in the area and who prospected for gold along the Bremner River . Located just to the north of the Bremner River , it was the scene of an important placer gold discovery in 1902 , and played a key role in the history of the Copper River Basin . Only a few miners struck it rich , but the resulting demand for materials and supplies helped establish regional transportation networks , encouraged supporting industries , and hastened the exploration and settlement of the entire region . While small-scale placer mining continued for over forty years , lode development was largely confined to the period between 1934 and 1941 , the district 's most significant era . The Bremner Historic Mining District embodies its period of twentieth-century mining , illustrating both its mining process and its evolutionary sequence . Unusually complete , it retains virtually all of its historic components , including an important placer site , a camp , four discrete lode mines , a mill , and an associated transportation network . The Golconda Mining Company site , which contains a campsite , an elaborate ditch , and extensive piles of hand-stacked cobble , provides an example of an early placer mining system . The Goldconda complex includes two airstrips dating to the 1930s . The Yellow Band mining camp is one of the region 's most complete , not only containing the typical housing and office facilities , but a sophisticated hydroelectric system . This camp is also significant for its association with Asa C. Baldwin , a distinguished regional explorer , surveyor , and mining engineer . While working for the U.S. Geodetic Survey , Baldwin completed the first American marine survey of Kodiak and the Aleutian Islands in 1909 .",
