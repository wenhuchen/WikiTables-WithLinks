  "/wiki/Owen_Willans_Richardson": "Sir Owen Willans Richardson , FRS ( 26 April 1879 - 15 February 1959 ) was a British physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928 for his work on thermionic emission , which led to Richardson 's law .",
  "/wiki/Thermionic_emission": "Thermionic emission is the liberation of electrons from an electrode by virtue of its temperature ( releasing of energy supplied by heat ) . This occurs because the thermal energy given to the carrier overcomes the work function of the material . The charge carriers can be electrons or ions , and in older literature are sometimes referred to as thermions . After emission , a charge that is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the total charge emitted is initially left behind in the emitting region . But if the emitter is connected to a battery , the charge left behind is neutralized by charge supplied by the battery as the emitted charge carriers move away from the emitter , and finally the emitter will be in the same state as it was before emission . The classical example of thermionic emission is that of electrons from a hot cathode into a vacuum ( also known as thermal electron emission or the Edison effect ) in a vacuum tube . The hot cathode can be a metal filament , a coated metal filament , or a separate structure of metal or carbides or borides of transition metals . Vacuum emission from metals tends to become significant only for temperatures over 1,000 K ( 730 \u00b0C ; 1,340 \u00b0F ) . The term thermionic emission is now also used to refer to any thermally-excited charge emission process , even when the charge is emitted from one solid-state region into another . This process is crucially important in the operation of a variety of electronic devices and can be used for electricity generation ( such as thermionic converters and electrodynamic tethers ) or cooling . The magnitude of the charge flow increases dramatically with increasing temperature .",

  "/wiki/Vitamin": "A vitamin is an organic molecule ( or related set of molecules ) that is an essential micronutrient that an organism needs in small quantities for the proper functioning of its metabolism . Essential nutrients can not be synthesized in the organism , either at all or not in sufficient quantities , and therefore must be obtained through the diet . Vitamin C can be synthesized by some species but not by others ; it is not a vitamin in the first instance but is in the second . The term vitamin does not include the three other groups of essential nutrients : minerals , essential fatty acids , and essential amino acids . Most vitamins are not single molecules , but groups of related molecules called vitamers . For example , vitamin E consists of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols . The thirteen vitamins required by human metabolism are vitamin A ( as all-trans-retinol , all-trans-retinyl-esters , as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids ) , vitamin B1 ( thiamine ) , vitamin B2 ( riboflavin ) , vitamin B3 ( niacin ) , vitamin B5 ( pantothenic acid ) , vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ) , vitamin B7 ( biotin ) , vitamin B9 ( folic acid or folate ) , vitamin B12 ( cobalamins ) , vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) , vitamin D ( calciferols ) , vitamin E ( tocopherols and tocotrienols ) , and vitamin K ( quinones ) . Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions . Vitamin A acts as a regulator of cell and tissue growth and differentiation . Vitamin D provides a hormone-like function , regulating mineral metabolism for bones and other organs . The B complex vitamins function as enzyme cofactors ( coenzymes ) or the precursors for them . Vitamins C and E function as antioxidants .",

He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Edgar Adrian , 1st Baron Adrian , in 1932 for their work on the functions of neurons . Prior to the work of Sherrington and Adrian , it was widely accepted that reflexes occurred as isolated activity within a reflex arc . Sherrington received the prize for showing that reflexes require integrated activation and demonstrated reciprocal innervation of muscles ( Sherrington 's law ) . Through his seminal 1906 publication , The Integrative Action of the Nervous System , he had effectively laid to rest the theory that the nervous system , including the brain , can be understood as a single interlinking network . His alternative explanation of synaptic communication between neurons helped shape our understanding of the central nervous system .",

  "/wiki/Neuron": "A neuron , neurone ( old British spelling ) or nerve cell , is an electrically excitable cell that communicates with other cells via specialized connections called synapses . It is the main component of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and placozoa . Plants and fungi do not have nerve cells . Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function . Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch , sound , or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs , and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain . Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output . Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord . A group of connected neurons is called a neural circuit . A typical neuron consists of a cell body ( soma ) , dendrites , and a single axon . The soma is usually compact . The axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it . Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma .",

  "/wiki/Appleton_layer": "The F region of the ionosphere is home to the F layer of ionization , also called the Appleton-Barnett layer , after the English physicist Edward Appleton and New Zealand physicist and meteorologist Miles Barnett . As with other ionospheric sectors , 'layer ' implies a concentration of plasma ( physics ) , while 'region ' is the volume that contains the said layer . The F region contains ionized gases at a height of around 150-800 km above sea level , placing it in the Earths thermosphere , a hot region in the upper atmosphere , and also in the heterosphere , where chemical composition varies with height . Generally speaking , the F region has the highest concentration of free electrons and ions anywhere in the atmosphere . It may be thought of as comprising two layers , the F1-and F2-layers . The F-region is located directly above the E region ( formerly the Kennelly-Heaviside layer ) and below the protonosphere . It acts as a dependable reflector of HF radio signals as it is not affected by atmospheric conditions , although its ionic composition varies with the sunspot cycle . It reflects normal-incident frequencies at or below the critical frequency ( approximately 10 MHz ) and partially absorbs waves of higher frequency .",

  "/wiki/Yellow_fever": "Yellow fever is a viral disease of typically short duration . In most cases , symptoms include fever , chills , loss of appetite , nausea , muscle pains particularly in the back , and headaches . Symptoms typically improve within five days . In about 15% of people , within a day of improving the fever comes back , abdominal pain occurs , and liver damage begins causing yellow skin . If this occurs , the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is increased . The disease is caused by yellow fever virus and is spread by the bite of an infected female mosquito . It infects only humans , other primates , and several types of mosquitoes . In cities , it is spread primarily by Aedes aegypti , a type of mosquito found throughout the tropics and subtropics . The virus is an RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus . The disease may be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses , especially in the early stages . To confirm a suspected case , blood-sample testing with polymerase chain reaction is required .

He is best known for his work at King 's College London on the structure of DNA . Wilkins ' work on DNA falls into two distinct phases . The first was in 1948-50 , when his initial studies produced the first clear X-ray images of DNA , which he presented at a conference in Naples in 1951 attended by James Watson . During the second phase , 1951-52 , Wilkins produced clear B form X shaped images from squid sperm , images he sent to James Watson and Francis Crick , causing Watson to write Wilkins . has obtained extremely excellent X-ray diffraction photographs [ of DNA ] . In 1953 Wilkins ' colleague Rosalind Franklin instructed Raymond Gosling to hand over to Wilkins a high quality image of B form DNA ( Photo 51 ) , which she had made in 1952 but had put it aside as she was leaving King 's College London . Wilkins showed it to Watson . This image , along with the knowledge that Linus Pauling had proposed an incorrect structure of DNA , mobilised Watson and Crick to restart model building . With additional information from research reports of Wilkins and Franklin , obtained via Max Perutz , Watson and Crick correctly described the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 . Wilkins continued to test , verify , and make significant corrections to the Watson-Crick DNA model and to study the structure of RNA .

The results were based partly on fundamental studies done by Rosalind Franklin , Raymond Gosling and Wilkins . Crick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played a crucial role in research related to revealing the helical structure of DNA . He is widely known for the use of the term central dogma to summarize the idea that once information is transferred from nucleic acids ( DNA or RNA ) to proteins , it can not flow back to nucleic acids . In other words , the final step in the flow of information from nucleic acids to proteins is irreversible . During the remainder of his career , he held the post of J.W . Kieckhefer Distinguished Research Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla , California .

  "/wiki/Nucleic_acid": "Nucleic acids are the biopolymers , or small biomolecules , essential to all known forms of life . The term nucleic acid is the overall name for DNA and RNA . They are composed of nucleotides , which are the monomers made of three components : a 5-carbon sugar , a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base . If the sugar is a compound ribose , the polymer is RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) ; if the sugar is derived from ribose as deoxyribose , the polymer is DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) . Nucleic acids are the most important of all biomolecules . These are found in abundance in all living things , where they function to create and encode and then store information of every living cell of every life-form organism on Earth . In turn , they function to transmit and express that information inside and outside the cell nucleus - to the interior operations of the cell and ultimately to the next generation of each living organism . The encoded information is contained and conveyed via the nucleic acid sequence , which provides the 'ladder-step ' ordering of nucleotides within the molecules of RNA and DNA . Strings of nucleotides are bonded to form helical backbones - typically , one for RNA , two for DNA - and assembled into chains of base-pairs selected from the five primary , or canonical , nucleobases , which are : adenine , cytosine , guanine , thymine , and uracil . Thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil only in RNA . Using amino acids and the process known as protein synthesis , the specific sequencing in DNA of these nucleobase-pairs enables storing and transmitting coded instructions as genes . In RNA , base-pair sequencing provides for manufacturing new proteins that determine the frames and parts and most chemical processes of all life forms .",

  "/wiki/Pharmacology": "Pharmacology is the branch of pharmaceutical sciences which is concerned with the study of drug or medication action , where a drug can be broadly or narrowly defined as any man-made , natural , or endogenous ( from within the body ) molecule which exerts a biochemical or physiological effect on the cell , tissue , organ , or organism ( sometimes the word pharmacon is used as a term to encompass these endogenous and exogenous bioactive species ) . More specifically , it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function . If substances have medicinal properties , they are considered pharmaceuticals . The field encompasses drug composition and properties , synthesis and drug design , molecular and cellular mechanisms , organ/systems mechanisms , signal transduction/cellular communication , molecular diagnostics , interactions , chemical biology , therapy , and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities . The two main areas of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics . Pharmacodynamics studies the effects of a drug on biological systems , and pharmacokinetics studies the effects of biological systems on a drug . In broad terms , pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with biological receptors , and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption , distribution , metabolism , and excretion ( ADME ) of chemicals from the biological systems . Pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are frequently confused . Pharmacology , a biomedical science , deals with the research , discovery , and characterization of chemicals which show biological effects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to these chemicals . In contrast , pharmacy , a health services profession , is concerned with the application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings ; whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role . In either field , the primary contrast between the two is their distinctions between direct-patient care , pharmacy practice , and the science-oriented research field , driven by pharmacology .",

Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America 's most significant novelists and essayists , and one of the leading writers of his generation . Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom . In 2010 he won the Nobel Prize in Literature , for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual 's resistance , revolt , and defeat . Vargas Llosa rose to international fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero ( La ciudad y los perros , literally The City and the Dogs , 1963/1966 ) , The Green House ( La casa verde , 1965/1968 ) , and the monumental Conversation in the Cathedral ( Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral , 1969/1975 ) .

  "/wiki/Peter_Higgs": "Peter Ware Higgs CH FRS FRSE FInstP ( born 29 May 1929 ) is a British theoretical physicist , Emeritus Professor in the University of Edinburgh and Nobel Prize laureate for his work on the mass of subatomic particles . In the 1960s , Higgs proposed that broken symmetry in electroweak theory could explain the origin of mass of elementary particles in general and of the W and Z bosons in particular . This so-called Higgs mechanism , which was proposed by several physicists besides Higgs at about the same time , predicts the existence of a new particle , the Higgs boson , the detection of which became one of the great goals of physics . On 4 July 2012 , CERN announced the discovery of the boson at the Large Hadron Collider . The Higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important ingredient in the Standard Model of particle physics , without which certain particles would have no mass . Higgs has been honoured with a number of awards in recognition of his work , including the 1981 Hughes Medal from the Royal Society ; the 1984 Rutherford Medal from the Institute of Physics ; the 1997 Dirac Medal and Prize for outstanding contributions to theoretical physics from the Institute of Physics ; the 1997 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize by the European Physical Society ; the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics ; the 2009 Oskar Klein Memorial Lecture medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ; the 2010 American Physical Society J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics ; and a unique Higgs Medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2012 . The discovery of the Higgs boson prompted fellow physicist Stephen Hawking to note that he thought that Higgs should receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work , which he finally did , shared with Fran\u00e7ois Englert in 2013 . Higgs was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 2013 New Year Honours and in 2015 the Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal , the world 's oldest scientific prize .",
  "/wiki/Fran\u00e7ois_Englert": "Fran\u00e7ois , Baron Englert ( French : [ \u0251\u0303\u0261l\u025b\u0281 ] ; born 6 November 1932 ) is a Belgian theoretical physicist and 2013 Nobel prize laureate . He is Professor emeritus at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles ( ULB ) where he is member of the Service de Physique Th\u00e9orique . He is also a Sackler Professor by Special Appointment in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel Aviv University and a member of the Institute for Quantum Studies at Chapman University in California . He was awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics ( with Gerry Guralnik , C. R. Hagen , Tom Kibble , Peter Higgs , and Robert Brout ) , the Wolf Prize in Physics in 2004 ( with Brout and Higgs ) and the High Energy and Particle Prize of the European Physical Society ( with Brout and Higgs ) in 1997 for the mechanism which unifies short and long range interactions by generating massive gauge vector bosons . He has made contributions in statistical physics , quantum field theory , cosmology , string theory and supergravity . He is the recipient of the 2013 Prince of Asturias Award in technical and scientific research , together with Peter Higgs and the CERN . Englert was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics , together with Peter Higgs for the discovery of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism .",
  "/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science": "A Bachelor of Science ( Latin Baccalaureus Scientiae , B.S. , BS , B.Sc . or BSc ; or , less commonly , S.B. , SB , or Sc.B. , from the equivalent Latin Scientiae Baccalaureus ) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for programs that generally last three to five years . The first university to admit a student to the degree of Bachelor of Science was the University of London in 1860 . Whether a student of a particular subject is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree or a Bachelor of Arts degree can vary between universities . For example , an economics degree may be given as a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) by one university but as a BS by another , and some universities offer the choice of either . Some liberal arts colleges in the United States offer only the BA , even in the natural sciences , while some universities offer only the BS , even in non-science fields . At universities that offer both BA and BS degrees in the same discipline , the BS degree is usually more extensive in that particular discipline and is targeted toward students who are pursuing graduate school or a profession in that field .",
  "/wiki/Master_of_Science": "A Master of Science ( Latin : Magister Scientiae ; abbreviated MS , M.S. , MSc , M.Sc. , SM , S.M. , ScM or Sc.M . ) is a master 's degree in the field of science awarded by universities in many countries or a person holding such a degree . In contrast to the Master of Arts degree , the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences , engineering and medicine and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects ; however , different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences . While it ultimately depends upon the specific program , earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a thesis .",
  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries . PhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields . As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree . Sometimes this status is also colloquially known as PhD ABD , meaning All But Dissertation .",

  "/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry": "The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry . It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 , awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry , physics , literature , peace , and physiology or medicine . This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation , and awarded by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by Academy . The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10 , the anniversary of Nobel 's death . The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff , of the Netherlands , for his discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions . From 1901 to 2018 , the award has been bestowed on a total of 180 individuals ."
