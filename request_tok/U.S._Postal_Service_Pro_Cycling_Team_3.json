For women 's cycle racing , a similar term , Queen of the Mountains ( QoM ) is used . While the title may be given to the rider who achieves the highest position over several designated climbs in a single-day road race , it is more usually applied to stage races ( for example , the Grand Tours , Tour de France , Giro d'Italia , Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and smaller races like the Tour of California ) where points are accumulated over the duration of the whole race . In the Tour de France , at the top of each significant climb , points are awarded to the riders who are first over the top . The climbs are categorised from 1 ( most difficult ) to 4 ( least difficult ) based on their steepness and length . A fifth category , called Hors categorie ( outside category ) applies to mountains rated even more severe than first category . Similar ratings apply to climbs in the other major Tours . In the Tour de France , the leader in the mountains competition wears a distinctive polka dot jersey ( French : maillot \u00e0 pois rouges ) .

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas .

Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD .
