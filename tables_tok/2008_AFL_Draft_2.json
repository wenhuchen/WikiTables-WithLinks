  "section_title": "2008 national draft",
  "section_text": "The 2008 national draft was held on 29 November . Melbourne finished the 2008 AFL season in last position and had the first selection in the draft . As both Melbourne and West Coast Eagles won less than 5 games during the season , they were eligible for a priority pick . As this was the first year in which they qualified , the priority pick was allocated between the first and second rounds of selections . Ayce Cordy was the first player selected in the draft as the only father\u2013son selection . The Western Bulldogs had to use their 1st round selection , # 14 , to secure him after St Kilda bid their # 1st round selection for him . His father , Brian , played 124 games for the Bulldogs in the 1980s . [ 61 ] The top two selections were widely tipped to be Jack Watts and Nic Naitanui , with Daniel Rich , Ty Vickery , Stephen Hill , Chris Yarran and Hamish Hartlett to fill the next few selections .

  "uid": "2008_AFL_Draft_2",
  "intro": "The 2008 AFL draft consisted of four opportunities for player acquisitions during the 2008/09 Australian Football League off-season. These were trade week (held between 6 October and 10 October), the national draft (held on 29 November), the pre-season draft (16 December) and the rookie draft (16 December). It was considered to be the last uncompromised draft before the draft concessions given to the Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney expansion teams restrict the existing AFL clubs' access to the best young players in the future years drafts."
