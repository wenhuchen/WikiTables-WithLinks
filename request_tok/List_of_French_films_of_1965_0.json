It stars Eddie Constantine , Anna Karina , Howard Vernon and Akim Tamiroff . The film won the Golden Bear award of the 15th Berlin International Film Festival in 1965 . Alphaville combines the genres of dystopian science fiction and film noir . There are no special props or futuristic sets ; instead , the film was shot in real locations in Paris , the night-time streets of the capital becoming the streets of Alphaville , while modernist glass and concrete buildings ( that in 1965 were new and strange architectural designs ) represent the city 's interiors . The film is set in the future but the characters also refer to twentieth-century events ; for example , the hero describes himself as a Guadalcanal veteran . Expatriate American actor Eddie Constantine plays Lemmy Caution , a trenchcoat-wearing secret agent . Constantine had already played this or similar roles in dozens of previous films ; the character was originally created by British pulp novelist Peter Cheyney . However , in Alphaville , director Jean-Luc Godard moves Caution away from his usual twentieth-century setting and places him in a futuristic sci-fi dystopia , the technocratic dictatorship of Alphaville .",

He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the 1960s French New Wave film movement . During his early career as a film critic , Godard criticized mainstream French cinema 's Tradition of Quality , which emphasized established convention over innovation and experimentation . In response , he and like-minded critics began to make their own films . Many of Godard 's films challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema . In 1964 , Godard described his and his colleagues ' impact : We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV . He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s ; his approach in film conventions , politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave . Along with showing knowledge of film history through homages and references , several of his films expressed his political views ; he was an avid reader of existential and Marxist philosophy . Since the New Wave , his politics have been much less radical and his recent films are about representation and human conflict from a humanist , and a Marxist perspective . In a 2002 Sight & Sound poll , Godard ranked third in the critics ' top ten directors of all time ( which was put together by assembling the directors of the individual films for which the critics voted ) . He is said to have created one of the largest bodies of critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century . He and his work have been central to narrative theory and have challenged both commercial narrative cinema norms and film criticism 's vocabulary .",

Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard , Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , \u00c9ric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette , Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma before beginning his career as a film maker . Chabrol 's career began with Le Beau Serge ( 1958 ) , inspired by Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) . Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol , with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity . This is especially apparent in Les Biches ( 1968 ) , La Femme infid\u00e8le ( 1969 ) , and Le Boucher ( 1970 ) - all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran , who was his wife at the time . Sometimes characterized as a mainstream New Wave director , Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career . In 1978 , he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozi\u00e8re . On the strength of that effort , the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary ( 1991 ) and La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie ( 1996 ) . Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper , if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol 's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium.Some of his films become almost private jokes , made to amuse himself . James Monaco has called Chabrol the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave , and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we do n't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard .",
