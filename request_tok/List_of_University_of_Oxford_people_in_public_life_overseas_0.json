  "/wiki/President_of_Botswana": "The President of the Republic of Botswana is the head of state and the head of government of Botswana , as well as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces , according to the Constitution of Botswana . The president is elected to a five-year term that runs concurrently with the term of the National Assembly . Since 1997 , he has been limited to a total of 10 years in office ( equivalent to two full terms ) , whether successive or separated . For example , if current president Mokgweetsi Masisi were to leave office in 2024 , he could run again in 2029 , but would have to leave office for good in 2034 . Presidential elections are indirect ; candidates for the legislature declare whom they endorse for president when they lodge their nomination papers , and the candidate who receives a majority of endorsements from the elected members of the National Assembly is automatically elected . If no candidate receives a majority of endorsements , the National Assembly elects the president by simple majority , before it co-opts the specially elected members . If no president is elected after three ballots , or if the Speaker determines that no candidate has enough support to be elected , the legislature is automatically dissolved . In practice , the president is the leader of the majority party in the Assembly .",

Originally , it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning strength , authority , rulership , derived from the verbal noun \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629 sul\u1e6dah , meaning authority or power ( cognate with the Hebrew word Shilton \u05e9\u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05df which retained that meaning to the present ) . Later , it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms ( i.e. , the lack of dependence on any higher ruler ) , albeit without claiming the overall caliphate , or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate . The adjective form of the word is sultanic , and the dynasty and lands ruled by a sultan are referred to as a sultanate ( \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0646\u0629 sal\u1e6danah ) . The term is distinct from king ( \u0645\u0644\u0643 malik ) , despite both referring to a sovereign ruler . The use of sultan is restricted to Muslim countries , where the title carries religious significance , contrasting the more secular king , which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries . In recent years , sultan has been gradually replaced by king by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the rule of law .

It was expelled from Malta under the French occupation in 1798 and , from 1805 to 1812 , much of its possessions in Protestant Europe were confiscated , resulting in the fragmentation of the order into a number of Protestant branches , since 1961 united under the umbrella of the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem .

  "/wiki/Merton_College,_Oxford": "Merton College ( in full : The House or College of Scholars of Merton in the University of Oxford ) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England . Its foundation can be traced back to the 1260s when Walter de Merton , chancellor to Henry III and later to Edward I , first drew up statutes for an independent academic community and established endowments to support it . An important feature of Walter 's foundation was that this college was to be self-governing and the endowments were directly vested in the Warden and Fellows . By 1274 , when Walter retired from royal service and made his final revisions to the college statutes , the community was consolidated at its present site in the south east corner of the city of Oxford , and a rapid programme of building commenced . The hall and the chapel and the rest of the front quad were complete before the end of the 13th century . Mob Quad , one of Merton 's quadrangles , was constructed between 1288 and 1378 , and is claimed to be the oldest quadrangle in Oxford , while Merton College Library , located in Mob Quad and dating from 1373 , is the oldest continuously functioning library for university academics and students in the world . Like many of Oxford 's colleges , Merton admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979 , after over seven centuries as an institution for men only . Notable alumni and academics past and present include four Nobel laureates and writer J. R. R. Tolkien who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature from 1945 to 1959 . Merton is one of the wealthiest colleges in Oxford and held funds totalling \u00a3272 million as of July 2017 . Merton has a strong reputation for academic success , having regularly ranked first in the Norrington Table in recent years .",
  "/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan": "The Emperor of Japan is the head of the Imperial Family and the head of state of Japan . Under the 1947 constitution , he is defined as the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people . Historically , he is also the highest authority of the Shinto religion . In Japanese , the Emperor is called Tenn\u014d ( \u5929\u7687 , pronounced [ tenno\ua71c\u02d0 ] ) , literally heavenly sovereign . In English , the use of the term Mikado ( \u5e1d\uff0f\u5fa1\u9580 ) for the Emperor was once common , but is now considered obsolete . Currently , the Emperor of Japan is the only head of state in the world with the English title of emperor . The Imperial House of Japan is the oldest continuing monarchical house in the world . The historical origins of the emperors lie in the late Kofun period of the 3rd-6th centuries AD , but according to the traditional account of the Kojiki ( finished 712 ) and Nihon Shoki ( finished 720 ) , Japan was founded in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu , who was said to be a direct descendant of the sun-goddess Amaterasu . Naruhito is the current Emperor of Japan . He acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne upon the abdication of his father , the now-Emperor Emeritus Akihito on 1 May 2019 at midnight JST . The role of the Emperor of Japan has historically alternated between a largely ceremonial symbolic role and that of an actual imperial ruler . Since the establishment of the first shogunate in 1199 , the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander , unlike many Western monarchs ."
