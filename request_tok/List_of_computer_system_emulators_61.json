With the success of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , Tangerine 's backers had suggested a home computer and Tangerine formed Oric Products International Ltd to develop and release the Oric-1 in 1983 . Further computers in the Oric range were released through to 1987 with Eastern European clones being produced into the 1990s .",
  "/wiki/Tangerine_Computer_Systems": "Tangerine Computer Systems was a British microcomputer company founded in 1979 by Dr. Paul Johnson , Mark Rainer and Nigel Penton Tilbury in St. Ives , Cambridgeshire . The very first product was the successful TAN1648 VDU kit which received much acclaim in the technical press . The home computer market was beginning to move , albeit slowly , and it was essential to establish a presence . Development and expansion was imperative . It was decided that the latter two partners would relinquish their involvement in order to focus on their consultancy work . Barry Muncaster became involved operationally and the company moved to new premises in Ely , Cambridgeshire . The company was later renamed , and was known as Oric Products International .",

It has 32 kilobytes of RAM , and its ROM includes BBC BASIC v2 along with its operating system . The Electron was able to save and load programs onto audio cassette via a supplied converter cable that connected it to any standard tape recorder that had the correct sockets . It was capable of basic graphics , and could display onto either a television set , a colour ( RGB ) monitor or a green screen monitor . For a short period , the Electron was reportedly the best selling micro in the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Amstrad_CPC": "The Amstrad CPC ( short for Colour Personal Computer ) is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990 . It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom , France , Spain , and the German-speaking parts of Europe . The series spawned a total of six distinct models : The CPC464 , CPC664 , and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market . The later 464plus and 6128plus , intended to prolong the system 's lifecycle with hardware updates , were considerably less successful , as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000 . The CPC models ' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU , complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM . Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device , either a compact cassette deck or 3 inch floppy disk drive . The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour , green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit 's power supply . Additionally , a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives , printers , and memory extensions , was available . The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software . The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor , its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users , which was reflected by a wide selection of application software . During its lifetime , the CPC series sold approximately three million units .",

  "/wiki/Atari_2600": "The Atari 2600 , originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System or Atari VCS for short until November 1982 , is a home video game console from Atari , Inc . Released on September 11 , 1977 , it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges ( a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976 ) instead of dedicated hardware with games physically built into the unit . The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers , a conjoined pair of paddle controllers , and a game cartridge : initially Combat , and later Pac-Man . The Atari VCS launched with nine simple , low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges . The system found its killer app with its version of Taito 's Space Invaders in 1980 and became widely successful , leading to the creation of Activision and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco . By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983-84 , games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for , such as Pitfall ! and its scrolling sequel Pitfall II : Lost Caverns . Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600 , Pac-Man and E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , that became commercial failures and contributed to the video game crash of 1983 which ended the market relevance of the 2600 . Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel . In 1986 , the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backwards-compatible Atari 7800 , but these were not enough to turn things around , and ultimately it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry . Atari finally ended production of the Atari 2600 on January 1 , 1992 .",

  "/wiki/MSX": "MSX is a standardized home computer architecture , announced by Microsoft and ASCII on June 16 , 1983 . It was conceived and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi , then vice-president at Microsoft and director at ASCII Corporation . Nishi conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various home computing system manufacturers of the period , in the same fashion as the VHS standard for home video tape machines . MSX systems were popular in Japan and several other countries . It is difficult to determine how many MSX computers were sold worldwide , but eventually 5 million MSX-based units were sold in Japan alone . Despite Microsoft 's involvement , few MSX-based machines were released in the United States . Before the great success of Nintendo 's Family Computer , MSX was the platform for which major Japanese game studios such as Konami and Hudson Soft produced video games . The Metal Gear series , for example , was first written for MSX hardware .",
  "/wiki/Sega_Master_System": "The Sega Master System ( SMS ) [ c ] is a third-generation 8-bit home video game console manufactured by Sega . It was originally a remodeled export version of the Sega Mark III , the third iteration of the SG-1000 series of consoles , which was released in Japan in 1985 and featured enhanced graphical capabilities over its predecessors . The Master System launched in North America in 1986 , followed by Europe in 1987 , and Brazil in 1989 . A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987 , which features a few enhancements over the export models ( and by proxy the original Mark III ) : a built-in FM audio chip , a rapid-fire switch , and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses . A cost-reduced model known as the Master System II was released in 1990 in North America and Europe . The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards . Accessories for the consoles include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with a range of specially designed games . The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot , turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system and is incompatible with the 3D glasses . The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES , due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity . Though the Master System had newer , improved hardware , it failed to overturn Nintendo 's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America . However , it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil .",

Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP . The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network . Alternatively , they could interact online using the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service . Its main competitor was Sony 's PlayStation Portable during the seventh generation of video game consoles . Prior to its release , the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental , third pillar in Nintendo 's console lineup , meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube . However , backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to the Game Boy series . On March 2 , 2006 , Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite , a slimmer and lighter redesign of the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens .

Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows .

In 1984 , Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the Classic Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software . The system , rebranded Mac OS in 1996 , was preinstalled on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s . Noted for its ease of use , it was also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors . The current Mac operating system is macOS , originally named Mac OS X until 2012 and then OS X until 2016 . Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple 's purchase of NeXT , Mac OS X brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP , a Unix system , that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced . The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and is updated annually . It is the basis of Apple 's current system software for its other devices - iOS , iPadOS , watchOS , and tvOS . Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X , Apple experimented with several other concepts , releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa , A/UX , MAE , and MkLinux . Apple 's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects , code named Star Trek , Taligent , and Copland . Although they have different architectures , the Macintosh operating systems share a common set of GUI principles , including a menu bar across the top of the screen ; the Finder shell , featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can ; and overlapping windows for multitasking .",

This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software .

  "/wiki/Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
