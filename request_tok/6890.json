Chanbara is a sub-category of jidaigeki , which equates to period drama . Jidaigeki may refer to a story set in a historical period , though not necessarily dealing with a samurai character or depicting swordplay . While earlier samurai period pieces were more dramatic rather than action-based , samurai movies produced post World War II have become more action-based , with darker and more violent characters . Post war samurai epics tended to portray psychologically or physically scarred warriors . Akira Kurosawa stylized and exaggerated death and violence in samurai epics . His samurai , and many others portrayed in film , were solitary figures , more often concerned with concealing their martial abilities , rather than showing them off . Historically , the genre is usually set during the Tokugawa era ( 1600-1868 ) . The samurai film hence often focuses on the end of an entire way of life for the samurai : many of the films deal with masterless r\u014dnin , or samurai dealing with changes to their status resulting from a changing society . Samurai films were constantly made into the early 1970s , but by then , overexposure on television , the aging of the big stars of the genre , and the continued decline of the mainstream Japanese film industry put a halt to most of the production of this genre .",

  "/wiki/Finger_5": "Finger Five ( \u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc5 , Fing\u0101 Faibu ) was a Japanese pop group , composed of the four Okinawan Tamamoto brothers , Kazuo , Mitsuo , Masao , Akira , and sister Taeko . Their greatest hit was Koi No Dial 6700 ( \u604b\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb6700 - Love Call 6700 ) . The Okinawa-based group performed catchy songs , wore matching outfits and had choreographed dance routines . They even performed cover versions of Motown hits , including those of the Jackson 5 . The band was formed in 1967 with only the three brothers Kazuo , Mitsuo and Masao , who performed as All Brothers . Conveniently their father owned a bar in Okinawa at which they performed . After winning a local talent contest it was decided that they could go farther if based in Tokyo , although at the time the eldest brother Kazuo was still only 14 . The group , who were partly inspired by the Partridge Family TV show , struggled in the Tokyo area , often playing at venues that catered to US military , as they had done in Okinawa . In 1970 , they signed with King Records as the Baby Brothers , but their three releases did not sell well . In early 1972 Akira and Taeko were added to the group and they became Finger Five . Later that year they debuted on the Phillips label , with First Album , and scored a huge hit with the single Kojin Jugyo ( Private Lessons ) in 1973 . Kojin Jugyo sold almost a million and a half copies , and follow-up singles Koi no Dial 6700 ( Love Call 6700 ) and Gakuen Tengoku were also major hits ."
