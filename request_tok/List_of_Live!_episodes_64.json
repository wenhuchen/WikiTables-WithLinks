  "/wiki/Santa": "Santa Claus , also known as Father Christmas , Saint Nicholas , Saint Nick , Kris Kringle , or simply Santa , is an imaginary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well-behaved children on the night of Christmas Eve ( 24 December ) or during the early morning hours of Christmas Day ( 25 December ) . The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas ( a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra ) , the British figure of Father Christmas , and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas ( himself also based on Saint Nicholas ) . Some maintain Santa Claus also absorbed elements of the Germanic god Wodan , who was associated with the pagan midwinter event of Yule and led the Wild Hunt , a ghostly procession through the sky . Santa Claus is generally depicted as a portly , jolly , white-bearded man - sometimes with spectacles - wearing a red coat with white fur collar and cuffs , white-fur-cuffed red trousers , red hat with white fur , and black leather belt and boots and carrying a bag full of gifts for children . This image became popular in the United States and Canada in the 19th century due to the significant influence of the 1823 poem A Visit from St. Nicholas and caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast . This image has been maintained and reinforced through song , radio , television , children 's books , films , and advertising . Santa Claus is said to make lists of children throughout the world , categorizing them according to their behavior , and to deliver presents , including toys and candy , to all of the well-behaved children in the world , and coal to all the misbehaving children , on the night of Christmas Eve . He accomplishes this feat with the aid of his elves , who make the toys in his workshop at the North Pole , and his flying reindeer , who pull his sleigh . He is commonly portrayed as living at the North Pole , and laughing in a way that sounds like ho ho ho .",
