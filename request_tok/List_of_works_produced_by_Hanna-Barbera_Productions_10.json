[ citation needed ] The Grimm Brothers ' story is an adaptation of the fairy tale Rapunzel by ( J. Achim Christoph ) Friedrich Schulz published in his collection Kleine Romane ( German : Little Romances ( 1790 ) . The Schulz version is based on Persinette by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force originally published in 1698 which in turn was influenced by an even earlier Italian tale , Petrosinella by Giambattista Basile , published in 1634 . Its plot has been used and parodied in various media and its best known line ( Rapunzel , Rapunzel , let down your hair ) is an idiom of popular culture . In volume I of the 1812 annotations ( Anhang ) , it is listed as coming from Friedrich Schulz 's Kleine Romane , Book 5 , pp . 269-288 , published in Leipzig 1790 . In the Aarne-Thompson classification system for folktales it is type 310 , The Maiden in The Tower . Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book . Other versions of the tale also appear in A Book of Witches by Ruth Manning-Sanders and in Paul O. Zelinsky 's 1997 Caldecott Medal-winning picture book , Rapunzel and the Disney movie Tangled . Rapunzel 's story has striking similarities to the Persian tale of Rud\u0101ba , included in the epic poem Shahnameh by Ferdowsi . Rud\u0101ba offers to let down her hair from her tower so that her lover Z\u0101l can climb up to her . Some elements of the fairy tale might also have originally been based upon the tale of Saint Barbara , who was said to have been locked in a tower by her father .",

For three decades in the 20th century , it was a prominent force and leader in American television animation as it created a variety of popular animated characters and a succession of cartoon series , including The Huckleberry Hound Show , The Flintstones , The Yogi Bear Show , The Jetsons , Wacky Races , Scooby-Doo , Where Are You ! and The Smurfs . Its cartoons won eight Emmys and seven Oscars and in addition , Hanna and Barbera were honored a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . The two men and Sidney sold the studio to Taft Broadcasting on December 29 , 1966 . By the mid-1980s , when the profitability of Saturday-morning cartoons was eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication , Hanna-Barbera 's fortunes had declined . Turner Broadcasting System purchased the studio from Taft ( by then renamed Great American Broadcasting ) in late 1991 and used much of its back catalog as the foundation and programming for Cartoon Network and later Boomerang . After Turner purchased the company , Hanna and Barbera continued to serve as creative consultants and mentors . The studio became a subsidiary of Warner Bros . Animation in 1996 following Turner 's merger with Time Warner and was ultimately absorbed into Warner Bros . Animation in 2001 , existing in name only . As of 2020 , Warner Bros. continues to produce new animation based on Hanna-Barbera 's catalog using the Hanna-Barbera brand name .",
