  "/wiki/Rush_(band)": "Rush was a Canadian rock band consisting of Geddy Lee ( bass , vocals , keyboards ) , Alex Lifeson ( guitars ) , and Neil Peart ( drums , percussion , lyricist ) . Formed in 1968 , the band went through several configurations until arriving at its longest and classic line-up when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974 , two weeks before the group 's first tour of the United States . Rush is known for its musicianship , complex compositions , and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction , fantasy , and philosophy . The band 's musical style has changed several times over the years , from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning , later moving into progressive rock , and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers . In the early 1990s , Rush returned to a guitar-driven hard rock sound , which continued for the rest of their career . Rush announced plans to cease large-scale touring at the end of 2015 , following the conclusion of their R40 Live Tour . After nearly three years of an uncertain future , Lifeson reluctantly announced in January 2018 that the band was not going to continue . Peart died of brain cancer at the age of 67 on January 7 , 2020 . According to the RIAA , Rush ranks 88th with sales of 25 million units in the U.S . Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity , several industry sources estimated Rush 's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units as of 2017 . The group has been awarded 24 gold , 14 platinum , and 3 multi-platinum albums . Rush has been nominated for seven Grammy Awards , has won several Juno Awards , and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards .",
  "/wiki/Rush_(Rush_album)": "Rush is the debut studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush , released on March 1 , 1974 , by the band 's own label Moon Records in Canada and by Mercury Records in the United States and internationally . This first release shows much of the hard rock sound typical of many of the popular rock bands emerging earlier in the decade . Rush were fans of such bands as Led Zeppelin and Cream , and these influences can be heard in most of the songs on the album . Original drummer John Rutsey performed all drum parts on the album , but was unable to go on extended tours because of complications with his diabetes and so he retired from the band after the album was released . Rutsey contributed to the album 's lyrics , but never submitted the work to the other members of the band . The lyrics were instead entirely composed by vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson . Rutsey was soon replaced by Neil Peart , who remained the band 's drummer as well as its primary lyricist .",
