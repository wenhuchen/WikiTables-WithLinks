It is the first novel in which he perfected the ingredients of his later work , skillfully mixing a plot full of adventure and twists that hold the reader 's interest with passages of technical , geographic , and historic description . The book gives readers a glimpse of the exploration of Africa , which was still not completely known to Europeans of the time , with explorers traveling all over the continent in search of its secrets . Public interest in fanciful tales of African exploration was at its height , and the book was an instant hit ; it made Verne financially independent and got him a contract with Jules Hetzel 's publishing house , which put out several dozen more works of his for over forty years afterward .",

Five years later , Verne wrote a sequel called Around the Moon . The story is also notable in that Verne attempted to do some rough calculations as to the requirements for the cannon and in that , considering the comparative lack of empirical data on the subject at the time , some of his figures are remarkably accurate . However , his scenario turned out to be impractical for safe manned space travel since a much longer barrel would have been required to reach escape velocity while limiting acceleration to survivable limits for the passengers .
