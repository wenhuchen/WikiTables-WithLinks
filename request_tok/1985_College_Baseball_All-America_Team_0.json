  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball , the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher 's mound toward the catcher to begin each play , with the goal of retiring a batter , who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the pitcher is assigned the number 1 . The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy . The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position .",

The game was held on July 11 , 1989 , at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim , California , the home of the California Angels of the American League . The game is noted for being the first in All-Star Game history to include the designated hitter . The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 5-3 . The game is remembered for Bo Jackson 's monstrous lead-off home run to center field . Jackson was named the game 's MVP . The game also featured former U.S. President and former baseball announcer Ronald Reagan sharing the NBC broadcast booth with Vin Scully for the first inning . The pregame ceremonies featured Disney characters joining this year 's players in sprinting onto the field for the introduction of the starting lineups . Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies , who had retired on May 29 , was still elected by the fans as the starting third baseman for the NL All-Star team . Schmidt decided not to play , but he did participate in the game 's opening ceremony in uniform . Doc Severinsen later led The Tonight Show Band in the playing of the Canadian and U.S. national anthems . Severinsen and The Tonight Show Band 's performance of the U.S. National Anthem was the last non-vocal performance of the Anthem at the All-Star Game to date .",
  "/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball": "In Major League Baseball , a shutout ( denoted statistically as ShO or SHO ) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run . If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act , no pitcher is awarded a shutout , although the team itself can be said to have shut out the opposing team . The ultimate single achievement among pitchers is a perfect game , which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years , most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15 , 2012 . By definition , a perfect game is counted as a shutout . A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors , base on balls , catcher 's interferences , dropped third strikes , or hit batsmen . The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson , who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907-1927 . He accumulated 110 shutouts , which is 20 more than the second place leader , Pete Alexander . The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16 , which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander ( 1916 ) and George Bradley ( 1876 ) . These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball , because pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching . Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers . The current leader among active players for career shutouts is Clayton Kershaw , who has thrown 15 .",
  "/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places .",
  "/wiki/Strikeouts": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

  "/wiki/Rolaids_Relief_Man_Award": "The Rolaids Relief Man Award was an annual Major League Baseball ( MLB ) award given from 1976 to 2012 to the top relief pitchers of the regular season , one in the American League ( AL ) and one in the National League ( NL ) . Relief pitchers are the pitchers who enter the game after the starting pitcher is removed . The award was sponsored by the antacid brand Rolaids , whose slogan was R-O-L-A-I-D-S spells relief . Because the first closers were nicknamed firemen , a reference to putting out the fire of another team 's rally , the trophy was a gold-plated firefighter 's helmet . Unlike other awards , such as the Cy Young Award or the MLB Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award , the Relief Man was based on statistical performance , rather than votes . Each save was worth three points ; each win was worth two points ; and each loss was worth negative two points . Beginning with the 1987 MLB season , negative two points were given for blown saves . In the 2000 MLB season , the term tough save , which was worth an additional point , was introduced by Rolaids . A tough save happened when a relief pitcher entered the game already having the potential tying run on base , and got the save . The player with the highest point total won the award . The inaugural award winners were Bill Campbell ( AL ) and Rawly Eastwick ( NL ) ; Campbell also won in the following season . Dan Quisenberry and Mariano Rivera each won the AL award five times , while Rollie Fingers and Bruce Sutter won the award four times each .",

  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses .",

A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",

  "/wiki/Silver_Slugger_Award": "The Silver Slugger Award is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position in both the American League and the National League , as determined by the coaches and managers of Major League Baseball . These voters consider several offensive categories in selecting the winners , including batting average , slugging percentage , and on-base percentage , in addition to coaches ' and managers ' general impressions of a player 's overall offensive value . Managers and coaches are not permitted to vote for players on their own team . The Silver Slugger was first awarded in 1980 and is given by Hillerich & Bradsby , the manufacturer of Louisville Slugger bats . The award is a bat-shaped trophy , 3 feet ( 91 cm ) tall , engraved with the names of each of the winners from the league and plated with sterling silver . The prize is presented to outfielders irrespective of their specific position . This means that it is possible for three left fielders , or any other combination of outfielders , to win the award in the same year , rather than one left fielder , one center fielder , and one right fielder . In addition , only National League pitchers receive a Silver Slugger Award ; lineups in the American League include a designated hitter in place of the pitcher in the batting order , so the designated hitter receives the award instead . Home run record-holder Barry Bonds won twelve Silver Slugger Awards in his career as an outfielder , the most of any player . He also won the award in five consecutive seasons twice in his career : from 1990 to 1994 , and again from 2000 to 2004 . Retired former New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza and former Seattle Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez are tied for second , with ten wins each .

Winners receive a glove made from gold lam\u00e9-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base . In the inaugural year , one Gold Glove was awarded to the top fielder at each position in MLB ; since 1958 , separate awards have been given to the top fielders in each league .

In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",
  "/wiki/Billy_Bates_(baseball)": "William Derrick Bates ( born December 7 , 1963 ) is a former Major League Baseball ( MLB ) second baseman and pinch runner who played for the Milwaukee Brewers and the 1990 World Series champion Cincinnati Reds . In 29 career games , Bates had a batting average of .125 with six hits , two runs batted in ( RBI ) , 11 runs , ten strikeouts , and eight stolen bases . Though defensively he played as a second baseman , the Reds primarily used Bates as a pinch runner . After he scored the winning run in Game 2 of the 1990 World Series , Bates never played in MLB again . Born in Houston , Bates attended the University of Texas and , in his freshman season , won the 1983 College World Series as a part of the Texas Longhorns baseball team . For the next two seasons , Bates was named to the College Baseball All-America Team , a team composed of the best collegiate baseball athletes in America . Drafted by Milwaukee in the 4th round of the 1985 MLB draft , he rose through the Brewers ' farm system and teams that he played for won multiple minor league titles . He subsequently made his MLB debut in 1989 , after Milwaukee 's starting second baseman became injured . A trade sent Bates to Cincinnati in 1990 , where the Reds used him as a pinch runner at the end of the regular season and into the postseason . Facing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series , Bates reached base on a pinch hit single against Dennis Eckersley and later scored the winning run in Game 2 , as the Reds ultimately swept the Athletics , four games to none . Following the World Series championship , Bates spent two years in minor league baseball , one for the Reds and one for the Chicago Cubs , and last played exhibition baseball in 1995 . After retirement , he worked as an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry in Houston and coached his daughter 's softball team .",
  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error .",
  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty .

  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",

Clark constructed the Hall of Fame 's building , and it was dedicated on June 12 , 1939 .

  "/wiki/Designated_hitter": "In baseball , the designated hitter rule is the common name for Major League Baseball Rule 5.11 , adopted by the American League in 1973 . The rule allows teams to have one player , known as the designated hitter ( or DH ) , to bat in place of the pitcher . Since 1973 , most collegiate , amateur , and professional leagues have adopted the rule or some variant . MLB 's National League and Nippon Professional Baseball 's Central League are the most prominent professional leagues that do not use a designated hitter .",
  "/wiki/Hit_(baseball)": "In baseball statistics , a hit ( denoted by H ) , also called a base hit , is credited to a batter when the batter safely reaches first base after hitting the ball into fair territory , without the benefit of an error or a fielder 's choice .",
  "/wiki/Home_runs": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",
  "/wiki/Runs_batted_in": "A run batted in ( RBI ) , plural runs batted in ( RBI or RBIs ) , is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored ( except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play ) . For example , if the batter bats a base hit , then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run , and the batter gets credited with batting in that run . Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season , runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic . Nevertheless , the RBI statistic was tabulated - unofficially - from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan , according to the Society for American Baseball Research . Common nicknames for an RBI include ribby ( or ribbie ) , rib , and ribeye . The plural of RBI is generally RBIs , although some commentators use RBI as both singular and plural , as it can also stand for runs batted in .",
  "/wiki/Run_(baseball)": "In baseball , a run is scored when a player advances around first , second and third base and returns safely to home plate , touching the bases in that order , before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured . A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely on base ( that is , on first , second , or third ) as a runner and subsequently brings him home . The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent . The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then , even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made , his run does not count . However , if the third out is not a force out , but a tag out , then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made , his run will count . In baseball statistics , a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run ( R ) , sometimes referred to as a run scored . While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic , it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in ( RBIs ) . Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent ; however , the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player 's contribution toward producing runs for his team . A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics , which differentiate between standard earned runs ( for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility ) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors , which do not count in his personal statistics . Specifically , if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning , the Official Scorer - the official in-game statistician - in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned , will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred . For example , with two outs , suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error , and then the next batter hits a two-run home run , and then the following batter then makes the third out , ending the inning . If the inning is reconstructed without the error , and if that third batter , instead of reaching on an error , registered an out , the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring .",
