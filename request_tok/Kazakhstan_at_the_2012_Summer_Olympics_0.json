As a competitor , his achievements include two bronze medals at the World Championships , four stage wins in the Tour de France , four in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a plus the overall title in 2006 , two Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge monuments , one Amstel Gold Race , and most recently , the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics Men 's Road Race . Vinokourov is a past national champion of Kazakhstan , and a dual-medalist at the Summer Olympics . In 2007 , he received a two-year ban from cycling for blood doping . In 2019 , he was accused of race fixing by prosecutors in Li\u00e8ge . Vinokourov began cycling in 1984 as an 11-year-old , competing within the former Soviet Union . He moved to France in 1997 to finish his amateur career , and then turned professional there in 1998 . After almost a decade as a professional , Vinokourov was caught blood doping during the 2007 Tour de France , which triggered the withdrawal of the entire Astana team from that year 's race . After a 2-year suspension from competition , he returned to cycling in August 2009 , riding first for the national team of Kazakhstan and then for his beloved Astana . A serious crash during the 2011 Tour de France threatened to prematurely end Vinokourov 's career for a second time , but he announced he would continue for one more season in 2012 - with an eye towards competing in the Olympic Games in London . There , Vinokourov played the role of ultimate spoiler when he dramatically won the gold medal in the men 's road race after breaking-away in the closing miles with Colombian Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n . Vinokourov retired after the Olympics and assumed management duties with Astana for 2013 .",
  "/wiki/Cycling_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics": "The cycling competitions at the 2012 Olympic Games in London took place at five venues between 28 July and 12 August . The venues were the London Velopark for track cycling and BMX , and Hadleigh Farm , in Essex , for mountain biking . The road races took place over a course starting and ending in The Mall in central London and heading out into Surrey , while the time trials started and finished at Hampton Court Palace in Richmond upon Thames . Eighteen events were contested and around 500 athletes participated . Cycling events have been contested in every Summer Olympics programme since the first modern Olympiad in 1896 alongside athletics , artistic gymnastics , fencing and swimming . Compared to the cycling at the 2008 Olympics , there were many changes in the Olympic track cycling programme . The men 's and women 's individual pursuit and points race , and the men 's Madison were removed . Team sprint , team pursuit and keirin were added to the women 's programme , while Omnium was a new race for both men and women . Countries were restricted to one entry per track event , a restriction which seemed to be directed at preventing the British team from double-medalling in the same event as they had in four events in 2008 , thus lowering their medal chances . However , similar to the 2008 Beijing Games , the cycling events were dominated by the British team , which , with a haul including eight gold medals , was the only one to win more than a single gold medal .",
