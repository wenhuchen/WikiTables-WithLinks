  "/wiki/Apollo": "Apollo [ a ] is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology . The national divinity of the Greeks , Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery , music and dance , truth and prophecy , healing and diseases , the Sun and light , poetry , and more . He is the son of Zeus and Leto , and the twin brother of Artemis , goddess of the hunt . Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros ( ephebe , or a beardless , athletic youth ) , Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods . Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu . As the patron deity of Delphi ( Apollo Pythios ) , Apollo is an oracular god - the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle . Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil ; various epithets call him the averter of evil . Delphic Apollo is the patron of seafarers , foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees . Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo , whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius . Apollo delivered people from epidemics , yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague with his arrows . The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis . Apollo is usually described as carrying a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows .",

His discussion of perfect proportion in architecture and the human body led to the famous Renaissance drawing by Leonardo da Vinci of Vitruvian Man . He was also the one who , in 40 BCE , invented the idea that all buildings should have three attributes : firmitas , utilitas , and venustas , meaning : strength , utility , and beauty . These principles were later adopted by the Romans . By his own description Vitruvius served as an artilleryman , the third class of arms in the military offices . He probably served as a senior officer of artillery in charge of doctores ballistarum ( artillery experts ) and libratores who actually operated the machines .",

  "/wiki/Rome": "Rome ( Latin and Italian : Roma [ \u02c8ro\u02d0ma ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy ( named Comune di Roma Capitale ) . Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",
  "/wiki/Italia_(Roman_Empire)": "Following the end of the Social War in 88 BC , Rome had allowed its Italian allies full rights in Roman society and granted Roman citizenship to all the Italic peoples . After having been for centuries the heart of the Roman Empire , from the 3rd century the government and the cultural center began to move eastward : first the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD extended Roman citizenship to all free men within the imperial boundaries . Then , Christianity became the dominant religion during Constantine 's reign ( 306-337 ) , raising the power of other Eastern political centres . Although not founded as a capital city in 330 , Constantinople grew in importance . It finally gained the rank of eastern capital when given an urban prefect in 359 and the senators who were clari became senators of the lowest rank as clarissimi . As a result , Italy began to decline in favour of the provinces , which resulted in the division of the Empire into two administrative units in 395 : the Western Roman Empire , with its capital at Mediolanum ( now Milan ) , and the Eastern Roman Empire , with its capital at Constantinople ( now Istanbul ) . In 402 , the capital was moved to Ravenna from Milan , confirming the decline of the city of Rome ( which was sacked in 410 for the first time in seven centuries ) .",

The temple served as an oracle and was dedicated to Jupiter Heliopolitanus . It is not known who commissioned or designed the temple , nor exactly when it was constructed . Work probably began around 16 BC and was nearly complete by about AD 60 . It is situated at the western end of the Great Court of Roman Heliopolis , on a broad platform of stone raised another 7 m ( 23 ft ) above the huge stones of the foundation , three of which are among the heaviest blocks ever used in a construction .

  "/wiki/Column": "A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits , through compression , the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below . In other words , a column is a compression member . The term column applies especially to a large round support ( the shaft of the column ) with a capital and a base or pedestal , which is made of stone , or appearing to be so . A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post , and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers . For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering , columns may be designed to resist lateral forces . Other compression members are often termed columns because of the similar stress conditions . Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest . In architecture , column refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features . A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes ; many columns are engaged , that is to say form part of a wall .",

The term can also apply to all sides , including the vertical members , of a frame with mouldings around a door or window . The word architrave is also used to refer more generally to a style of mouldings ( or other elements ) framing the top of a door , window or other rectangular opening , where the horizontal head casing extends across the tops of the vertical side casings where the elements join ( forming a butt joint , as opposed to a miter joint ) .",
  "/wiki/Frieze": "In architecture , the frieze /fri\u02d0z/ is the wide central section part of an entablature and may be plain in the Ionic or Doric order , or decorated with bas-reliefs . Paterae are also usually used to decorate friezes . Even when neither columns nor pilasters are expressed , on an astylar wall it lies upon the architrave ( main beam ) and is capped by the moldings of the cornice . A frieze can be found on many Greek and Roman buildings , the Parthenon Frieze being the most famous , and perhaps the most elaborate . This style is typical for the Persians . In interiors , the frieze of a room is the section of wall above the picture rail and under the crown moldings or cornice . By extension , a frieze is a long stretch of painted , sculpted or even calligraphic decoration in such a position , normally above eye-level . Frieze decorations may depict scenes in a sequence of discrete panels . The material of which the frieze is made of may be plasterwork , carved wood or other decorative medium . In an example of an architectural frieze on the fa\u00e7ade of a building , the octagonal Tower of the Winds in the Roman agora at Athens bears relief sculptures of the eight winds on its frieze . A pulvinated frieze ( or pulvino ) is convex in section . Such friezes were features of 17th-century Northern Mannerism , especially in subsidiary friezes , and much employed in interior architecture and in furniture .",
  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",
  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume , and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite .",

The province encompassed most of modern-day Egypt except for the Sinai Peninsula ( which would later be conquered by Trajan ) . Aegyptus was bordered by the provinces of Crete and Cyrenaica to the west and Judea ( later Arabia Petraea ) to the East . The province came to serve as a major producer of grain for the empire and had a highly developed urban economy . Aegyptus was by far the wealthiest Eastern Roman province , and by far the wealthiest Roman province outside of Italia .

  "/wiki/Trajan's_Column": "Trajan 's Column ( Italian : Colonna Traiana , Latin : COLVMNA\u00b7TRAIANI ) is a Roman triumphal column in Rome , Italy , that commemorates Roman emperor Trajan 's victory in the Dacian Wars . It was probably constructed under the supervision of the architect Apollodorus of Damascus at the order of the Roman Senate . It is located in Trajan 's Forum , built near the Quirinal Hill , north of the Roman Forum . Completed in AD 113 , the freestanding column is most famous for its spiral bas relief , which artistically represents the wars between the Romans and Dacians ( 101-102 and 105-106 ) . Its design has inspired numerous victory columns , both ancient and modern . The structure is about 30 metres ( 98 feet ) in height , 35 metres ( 115 feet ) including its large pedestal . The shaft is made from a series of 20 colossal Carrara marble [ a ] drums , each weighing about 32 tons , with a diameter of 3.7 metres ( 12.1 feet ) . The 190-metre ( 620-foot ) frieze winds around the shaft 23 times . Inside the shaft , a spiral staircase of 185 steps provides access to a viewing platform at the top . The capital block of Trajan 's Column weighs 53.3 tons , which had to be lifted to a height of c. 34 metres ( 112 feet ) . Ancient coins indicate preliminary plans to top the column with a statue of a bird , probably an eagle , but after construction , a statue of Trajan was put in place ; this statue disappeared in the Middle Ages .

  "/wiki/Capital_(architecture)": "In architecture the capital ( from the Latin caput , or head ) or chapiter forms the topmost member of a column ( or a pilaster ) . It mediates between the column and the load thrusting down upon it , broadening the area of the column 's supporting surface . The capital , projecting on each side as it rises to support the abacus , joins the usually square abacus and the usually circular shaft of the column . The capital may be convex , as in the Doric order ; concave , as in the inverted bell of the Corinthian order ; or scrolling out , as in the Ionic order . These form the three principal types on which all capitals in the classical tradition are based . The Composite order established in the 16th century on a hint from the Arch of Titus , adds Ionic volutes to Corinthian acanthus leaves . From the highly visible position it occupies in all colonnaded monumental buildings , the capital is often selected for ornamentation ; and is often the clearest indicator of the architectural order . The treatment of its detail may be an indication of the building 's date .",

It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives .

The city extends about 40 km ( 25 mi ) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea . Alexandria is a popular tourist destination , and also an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez . Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great , king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth , during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire . An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria . Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years , until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , when a new capital was founded at Fustat ( later absorbed into Cairo ) . Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( Pharos ) , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ; its Great Library ( the largest in the ancient world ) ; and the Necropolis , one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages . Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity . It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome . The city was a major center of early Christianity and was the center of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , which was one of the major centers of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire .
