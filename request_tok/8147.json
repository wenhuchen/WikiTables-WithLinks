  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",
  "/wiki/Eponym": "An eponym is a person , place , or thing after whom or after which something is named , or believed to be named , or the thing so named . The adjectives derived from eponym include eponymous and eponymic . For example , Elizabeth I of England is the eponym of the Elizabethan era , and the eponymous founder of the Ford Motor Company refers to Henry Ford , and Ford and Elizabethan England are both eponyms .",

  "/wiki/Uzo_Egonu": "Uzo Egonu ( 25 December 1931 - 14 August 1996 ) was a Nigerian-born artist who settled in Britain in the 1940s , only once returning to his homeland for two days in the 1970s , although he remained concerned with African political struggles . According to Rasheed Araeen , Egonu was perhaps the first person from Africa , Asia or the Caribbean to come to Britain after the War with the sole intention of becoming an artist . According to critic Molara Wood , Egonus work merged European and Igbo traditions but more significantly , placed Africa as the touchstone of modernism . In combining the visual languages of Western and African art , he helped redefine the boundaries of modernism , thereby challenging the European myth of the na\u00efve , primitive African artist .",

  "/wiki/Duke_Ellington": "Edward Kennedy Duke Ellington ( April 29 , 1899 - May 24 , 1974 ) was an American composer , pianist , and leader of a jazz orchestra , which he led from 1923 until his death over a career spanning more than six decades . Born in Washington , D.C. , Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra 's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem . In the 1930s , his orchestra toured in Europe . Although widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz , Ellington embraced the phrase beyond category as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music rather than to a musical genre such as jazz . Some of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington 's orchestra , such as saxophonist Johnny Hodges , are considered to be among the best players in the idiom . Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz . Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades . A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format , Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions ; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy , with many of his pieces having become standards . Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen , for example Juan Tizol 's Caravan , and Perdido , which brought a Spanish tinge to big band jazz . In the early 1940s , Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn , whom he called his writing and arranging companion . With Strayhorn , he composed many extended compositions , or suites , as well as additional short pieces . Following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival , in July 1956 , Ellington and his orchestra enjoyed a major revival and embarked on world tours .",
  "/wiki/Eminescu_(crater)": "Eminescu is a peak ring crater on Mercury 125 kilometers ( 78 mi ) in diameter . Since there are very few later craters superposed on it , Eminescu appears to be a young crater formed around one billion years ago . It has a transitional morphology between larger more complex impact basins like Raditladi and smaller simpler central peak craters . The impact ejecta and chains of secondary craters extend as far as one radius from the rim . There are no bright or dark crater rays , with the crater rim itself being higher in altitude than the surrounding cratered plains . The crater walls are degraded by slumping , forming distinct blocks of material . The crater floor consists of complex structures , including ejecta deposits , impact melts and possibly units placed by effusive volcanism . The bright bluish central peaks within the crater are arranged in a circular pattern forming a peak ring . The peaks exhibit unusual color characteristics similar to the bright crater floor deposits ( BCFD ) seen in other craters on Mercury . The crater floor both inside and outside the peak ring is covered by dark smooth plains , which appear to surround it . These plains are probably volcanic in origin . Further from the peak ring near the crater walls , there are areas covered by a bright material .",
  "/wiki/Mihai_Eminescu": "Mihai Eminescu ( Romanian pronunciation : [ mi\u02c8haj emi\u02c8nesku ] ( listen ) ; born Mihail Eminovici ; 15 January 1850 - 15 June 1889 ) was a Romantic poet , novelist , and journalist , generally regarded as the most famous and influential Romanian poet , as well as the first modern poet in Romanian literature . Eminescu was an active member of the Junimea literary society and worked as an editor for the newspaper Timpul ( The Time ) , the official newspaper of the Conservative Party ( 1880-1918 ) . His poetry was first published when he was 16 and he went to Vienna to study when he was 19 . The poet 's manuscripts , containing 46 volumes and approximately 14,000 pages , were offered by Titu Maiorescu as a gift to the Romanian Academy during the meeting that was held on 25 January 1902. Notable works include Luceaf\u0103rul ( The Vesper/The Evening Star/The Lucifer/The Daystar ) , Od\u0103 \u00een metru antic ( Ode in Ancient Meter ) , and the five Letters ( Epistles/Satires ) . In his poems he frequently used metaphysical , mythological and historical subjects . His father was Gheorghe Eminovici from C\u0103line\u0219ti , a Moldavian village in Suceava county , Bucovina , which was then part of the Austrian Empire ( while his father came from Banat ) . He crossed the border into Moldavia , settling in Ipote\u0219ti , near the town of Boto\u0219ani . He married Raluca Iura\u0219cu , an heiress of an old aristocratic Moldavian family . In a Junimea register , Eminescu wrote down his birthday date as 22 December 1849 , while in the documents of Cern\u0103u\u021bi Gymnasium , where Eminescu studied , his birth date is 14 December 1849 . Nevertheless , Titu Maiorescu , in his work Eminescu and His Poems ( 1889 ) quoted N. D. Giurescu 's research and adopted his conclusion regarding the date and place of Mihai Eminescu 's birth , as being 15 January 1850 , in Boto\u0219ani . This date resulted from several sources , among which there was a file of notes on christenings from the archives of the Uspenia ( Domneasc\u0103 ) Church of Boto\u0219ani ; inside this file , the date of birth was 15 January 1850 and the date of christening was the 21st of the same month . The date of his birth was confirmed by the poet 's elder sister , Aglae Drogli , who affirmed that the place of birth was the village of Ipote\u0219ti .",
