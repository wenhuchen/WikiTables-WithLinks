  "/wiki/Rio_Grande": "The Rio Grande ( /\u02c8ri\u02d0o\u028a \u02c8\u0261r\u00e6nd/ or /\u02c8ri\u02d0o\u028a \u02c8\u0261r\u0251\u02d0nde\u026a/ ; Spanish : R\u00edo Bravo del Norte , Spanish pronunciation : [ \u02c8ri.o \u02c8\u03b2\u027ea\u03b2o \u00f0el \u02c8no\u027ete ] ( listen ) or simply R\u00edo Bravo ) is one of the principal rivers ( along with the Colorado River ) in the southwest United States and northern Mexico . The Rio Grande begins in south-central Colorado in the United States and flows to the Gulf of Mexico . After passing through the length of New Mexico along the way , it forms part of the Mexico-United States border . According to the International Boundary and Water Commission , its total length was 1,896 miles ( 3,051 km ) in the late 1980s , though course shifts occasionally result in length changes . Depending on how it is measured , the Rio Grande is either the fourth- or fifth-longest river system in North America . The river serves as part of the natural border between the U.S. state of Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas . A very short stretch of the river serves as part of the boundary between the U.S. states of Texas and New Mexico . Since the mid-20th century , heavy water consumption by farms and cities along with many large diversion dams on the river has left only 20% of its natural discharge to flow to the Gulf . Near the river 's mouth , the heavily irrigated lower Rio Grande Valley is an important agricultural region . The Rio Grande 's watershed covers 182,200 square miles ( 472,000 km2 ) . Many endorheic basins are situated within , or adjacent to , the Rio Grande 's basin , and these are sometimes included in the river basin 's total area , increasing its size to about 336,000 square miles ( 870,000 km2 ) .",

  "/wiki/D&RGW_463": "D & RGW 463 is a 3-foot narrow gauge , Mikado type , 2-8-2 steam railway locomotive built for the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1903 . It is one of two remaining locomotives of D & RGW class K-27 , the other one being number 464 at the Huckleberry Railroad in Genesee Township , Michigan . The class eventually became known by the nickname Mudhens . Fifteen locomotives were built , originally class 125 , then reclassified K-27 in 1924 when the D & RG became the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad . The K-27s were built as Vauclain compounds , with two cylinders on each side , expanding the steam once in the smaller cylinder and then a second time in the larger one . The extra maintenance costs of the two cylinders were greater than the fuel saving , so they were converted to simple expansion in 1907-1909 . They were Rio Grande 's last purchase of compound locomotives . They pulled freight , passenger and mixed trains on the D & RGW in and over the Colorado Rocky Mountains , traversing the entire length of the railroad . They were built with their main structural frames outside the driving wheels , with the counterweights and rods attached outside the frames . No . 463 was sold to cowboy actor and singer Gene Autry in May 1955 . Autry never used the engine and donated it to the town of Antonito , Colorado .",

Today the highway 's northern terminus is in Denver , at exit 201 on Interstate 25 . US 285 is a secondary route of US 85 , which it crosses in metro Denver , and historically crossed again in Santa Fe , New Mexico ( today its parent route has been largely replaced by Interstate 25 , and as a result US 85 is no longer signed in New Mexico ) . US 285 also intersects a sibling route , US 385 , in Fort Stockton , Texas . Trucking makes up a large portion of the route 's traffic , but along much of its route the road is also used for local travel from one town to the next . The northern section of US 285 , from Santa Fe to Denver , traverses mountainous and rocky terrain ; with that in mind , anyone using the road should check weather conditions during the winter months .",

  "/wiki/D&RGW_168": "Denver and Rio Grande Western No . 168 is a 4-6-0 Ten Wheeler type narrow gauge steam railway locomotive . It is one of twelve similar locomotives built for the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1883 . It was built as a passenger locomotive , with 46 in ( 1,200 mm ) drivers , the largest drivers used on any three foot gauge D & RGW locomotive . The large drivers made it suitable for relatively fast passenger service . As is the case with many small , early locomotives , we know little of their operating history . In the case of 168 , what we know comes entirely from photographs taken of it . The first shows it in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison River in 1904 . The second pair show it in Montrose , Colorado , west of Gunnison , at the head of a special train taking President William Howard Taft to the opening of the Gunnison Tunnel which , at the time , was the longest irrigation tunnel in the world . There are also photographs , taken by Otto Perry , showing it in Alamosa in 1923 and Salida in 1929 . It was retired in 1938 after a service life of 55 years , later than most of its class . The railroad gave it to the City of Colorado Springs on August 1 , 1938 .",
