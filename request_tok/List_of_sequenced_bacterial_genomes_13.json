  "/wiki/Agrobacterium_tumefaciens": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( updated scientific name Rhizobium radiobacter , synonym Agrobacterium radiobacter ) is the causal agent of crown gall disease ( the formation of tumours ) in over 140 species of eudicots . It is a rod-shaped , Gram-negative soil bacterium . Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA ( known as the T-DNA , for 'transfer DNA ' , not to be confused with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis ) , from a plasmid into the plant cell , which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome . A. tumefaciens is an alphaproteobacterium of the family Rhizobiaceae , which includes the nitrogen-fixing legume symbionts . Unlike the nitrogen-fixing symbionts , tumor-producing Agrobacterium species are pathogenic and do not benefit the plant . The wide variety of plants affected by Agrobacterium makes it of great concern to the agriculture industry . Economically , A. tumefaciens is a serious pathogen of walnuts , grape vines , stone fruits , nut trees , sugar beets , horse radish , and rhubarb , and the persistent nature of the tumors or galls caused by the disease make it particularly harmful for perennial crops . A. tumefaciens grows optimally at 28 \u00b0C . The doubling time can range from 2.5-4h depending on the media , culture format , and level of aeration . At temperatures above 30 \u00b0C , A. tumefaciens begins to experience heat shock which is likely to result in errors in cell division .",
  "/wiki/Alphaproteobacteria": "Alphaproteobacteria is a class of bacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria ( See also bacterial taxonomy ) . Its members are highly diverse and possess few commonalities , but nevertheless share a common ancestor . Like all Proteobacteria , its members are gram-negative and some of its intracellular parasitic members lack peptidoglycan and are consequently gram variable .",
  "/wiki/Anaplasma_phagocytophilum": "Anaplasma phagocytophilum ( formerly Ehrlichia phagocytophilum ) is a Gram-negative bacterium that is unusual in its tropism to neutrophils . It causes anaplasmosis in sheep and cattle , also known as tick-borne fever and pasture fever , and also causes the zoonotic disease human granulocytic anaplasmosis . A. phagocytophilum is a Gram-negative , obligate bacterium of neutrophils . It causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis , which is a tick-borne rickettsial disease . Because this bacterium invades neutrophils , it has a unique adaptation and pathogenetic mechanism .",

  "/wiki/Bradyrhizobium_japonicum": "Bradyrhizobium japonicum is a species of legume-root nodulating , microsymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria . The species is one of many Gram-negative , rod-shaped bacteria commonly referred to as rhizobia . [ citation needed ] Within that broad classification , which has three groups , taxonomy studies using DNA sequencing indicate that B. japonicum belongs within homology group II .",
  "/wiki/Brucella_abortus": "Brucella abortus is a Gram-negative alpha-proteobacterium in the family Brucellaceae and is one of the causative agents of brucellosis . The rod-shaped pathogen is classified under the domain Bacteria . The prokaryotic B. abortus is non-spore-forming , non-motile and aerobic .",
  "/wiki/Brucella_melitensis": "Brucella melitensis is a Gram-negative coccobacillus bacterium from the Brucellaceae family . The bacterium causes ovine brucellosis , along with Brucella ovis . It affects primarily sheep and goats , but cases have also been observed in cattle , yaks , water buffalo , Bactrian and dromedary camels , alpacas , dogs , horses and pigs . Humans can become infected if they have contact with an infected animal or its byproducts . Animals acquire B. melitensis by venereal transmission and contact with the placenta , fetus , fetal fluids , and vaginal discharges from infected animals . The organism is found in blood , urine , milk , and semen . It is zoonotic , unlike B. ovis , causing Malta fever or localized brucellosis in humans .",
  "/wiki/Brucella_suis": "Brucella suis is a bacterium that causes swine brucellosis , a zoonosis that affects pigs . The disease typically causes chronic inflammatory lesions in the reproductive organs of susceptible animals or orchitis , and may even affect joints and other organs . The most common symptom is abortion in pregnant susceptible sows at any stage of gestation . Other manifestations are temporary or permanent sterility , lameness , posterior paralysis , spondylitis , and abscess formation . It is transmitted mainly by ingestion of infected tissues or fluids , semen during breeding , and suckling infected animals . Since brucellosis threatens the food supply and causes undulant fever , Brucella suis and other Brucella species ( B. melitensis , B. abortis , B. ovis , B. canis ) are recognized as potential agricultural , civilian , and military bioterrorism agents .",
  "/wiki/Caulobacter_crescentus": "Caulobacter crescentus is a Gram-negative , oligotrophic bacterium widely distributed in fresh water lakes and streams . Caulobacter is an important model organism for studying the regulation of the cell cycle , asymmetric cell division , and cellular differentiation . Caulobacter daughter cells have two very different forms . One daughter is a mobile swarmer cell that has a single flagellum at one cell pole that provides swimming motility for chemotaxis . The other daughter , called the stalked cell , has a tubular stalk structure protruding from one pole that has an adhesive holdfast material on its end , with which the stalked cell can adhere to surfaces . Swarmer cells differentiate into stalked cells after a short period of motility . Chromosome replication and cell division only occurs in the stalked cell stage . Its name derives from its crescent shape caused by the protein crescentin , discovered by Christine Jacobs-Wagner 's laboratory . Its use as a model originated with developmental biologist Lucy Shapiro .",
  "/wiki/Ehrlichia_canis": "Ehrlichia canis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that acts as the causative agent of ehrlichiosis , a disease most commonly affecting canine species . This pathogen is present throughout the United States ( but is most prominent in the South ) , South America , Asia , and Africa . First defined in 1935 , E. canis emerged in the United States in 1963 and its presence has since been found in all 48 contiguous United States . Reported primarily in dogs , E. canis has also been documented in felines and humans , where it is transferred most commonly via Rhipicephalus sanguineus , the brown dog tick .",
  "/wiki/Ehrlichia_chaffeensis": "Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular , Gram-negative species of Rickettsiales bacteria . It is a zoonotic pathogen transmitted to humans by the lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ) . It is the causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis . Genetic studies support the endosymbiotic theory that a subset of these organisms evolved to live inside mammalian cells as mitochondria to provide cellular energy to the cells in return for protection and sustenance . ATP production in the rickettsiae is biochemically identical to that in mammalian mitochondria ; all multi-cellular eukaryotes have mitochondria in their cells , including birds , fish , reptiles , invertebrates , plants , and fungi in addition to mammals . Human monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by E. chaffeensis is known to spread through tick infection primarily in the Southern , South-central and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States . In recent years , the lone star tick has expanded its range along the East Coast to New England , putting more humans at risk for tick-borne infections . It is named for Fort Chaffee , where the bacterium was first discovered in blood samples of infected patients .",
  "/wiki/Ehrlichia_ruminantium": "Heartwater ( also known as cowdriosis , nintas , and ehrlichiosis ) is a tick-borne rickettsial disease of domestic and wild ruminants . It is caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium ( formerly Cowdria ruminantium ) - an intracellular Gram-negative coccal bacterium ( also referred to as Rickettsia ruminantium ) . The disease is spread by bont ticks , which are members of the genus Amblyomma . Affected mammals include cattle , sheep , goats , antelope , and buffalo , but the disease has the biggest economic impact on cattle production in affected areas . The disease 's name is derived from the fact that fluid can collect around the heart or in the lungs of infected animals . The disease is common in sub-Saharan Africa and some of the West Indian islands . It was first identified in sheep in South Africa in the 1830s , and had reached the Caribbean by 1980 . The ticks that carry the disease occur in Africa and the Caribbean , and feed on a wide variety of vertebrate hosts . In the Caribbean , at least , the cattle egret has been implicated in the spread of heartwater , since it colonized the islands in the 1950s . Animals often acquire the disease when moved onto pastures where infected ticks are found . Cowdriosis is notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health ."
