  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",

Named for George Washington , the first U.S. president , the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory , which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846 , in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute . The state , which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean , Oregon to the south , Idaho to the east , and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north , was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889 . Olympia is the state capital ; the state 's largest city is Seattle . Washington is often referred to as Washington State to distinguish it from the nation 's capital , Washington , D.C.

Approximately 60 percent of Washington 's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area , the center of transportation , business , and industry along Puget Sound , an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands , deep fjords , and bays carved out by glaciers . The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west ; mountain ranges in the west , central , northeast , and far southeast ; and a semi-arid basin region in the east , central , and south , given over to intensive agriculture . Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States , after California . Mount Rainier , an active stratovolcano , is the state 's highest elevation , at almost 14,411 feet ( 4,392 meters ) , and is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous U.S. Washington is a leading lumber producer . Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir , hemlock , ponderosa pine , white pine , spruce , larch , and cedar . The state is the US 's largest producer of apples , hops , pears , red raspberries , spearmint oil , and sweet cherries , and ranks high in the production of apricots , asparagus , dry edible peas , grapes , lentils , peppermint oil , and potatoes . Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue , and the commercial fishing of salmon , halibut , and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state 's economy .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Bureau_of_Reclamation": "The United States Bureau of Reclamation ( USBR ) , and formerly the United States Reclamation Service , is a federal agency under the U.S. Department of the Interior , which oversees water resource management , specifically as it applies to the oversight and operation of the diversion , delivery , and storage projects that it has built throughout the western United States for irrigation , water supply , and attendant hydroelectric power generation . Currently the USBR is the largest wholesaler of water in the country , bringing water to more than 31 million people , and providing one in five Western farmers with irrigation water for 10 million acres of farmland , which produce 60% of the nation 's vegetables and 25% of its fruits and nuts . The USBR is also the second largest producer of hydroelectric power in the western United States . On June 17 , 1902 , in accordance with the Reclamation Act , Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock established the U.S. Reclamation Service within the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) . The new Reclamation Service studied potential water development projects in each western state with federal lands - revenue from sale of federal lands was the initial source of the program 's funding . Because Texas had no federal lands , it did not become a Reclamation state until 1906 , when Congress passed a law including it in the provisions of the Reclamation Act .",

  "/wiki/Horn_Rapids_Dam": "Horn Rapids Dam ( also known as Wanawish Dam ) is a rock filled timber crib barrage dam on the Yakima River in Benton County , Washington near the intersection of SR 240 and SR 225 . The dam is not used for hydroelectric production , rather to fill irrigation canals on either bank of the river . Permits for the dam were filed by the Yakima Irrigation and Improvement Company in 1889 , and the original dam was completed in 1892 . When the company went under in 1896 , the dam was bought by the Northwestern Pacific Company ( a subsidiary of Northern Pacific ) . A more substantial dam was put in place in 1908 , when the northern irrigation canal was built . The dam was damaged in a flood in 1996 , but was replaced by a concrete structure in 1997 . Former Camp Columbia ( occasionally referred to as Columbia Camp ) was located on the north bank of the river just above the dam . This was a prison camp during World War II for low-security prisoners ; political dissidents and the like . The camp was operated from 1944 through 1947 . There were barracks and a large orchard , but no perimeter fences , and inmates were allowed to move about freely . The dam is still used as a historic fishing location by the Yakama Indian Nation , and traditional fishing scaffolds can be seen there year-round ."
