  "/wiki/Hang-On": "Hang-On [ a ] is an arcade game designed by Yu Suzuki and released by Sega in 1985 . It was also ported to the Master System . In the game , the player controls a motorcycle against time and other computer-controlled bikes . It was one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and utilizes the Super Scaler arcade system board , created with design input from Suzuki , as technology to simulate 3D effects . The deluxe cabinet version also introduced a motion controlled arcade cabinet , where the player 's body movement on a large motorbike-shaped cabinet corresponds with the player character 's movements on screen . Suzuki began development of Hang-On after deciding to design a motorcycle racing game as a way to use a torsion bar in an arcade game . With market research suggesting GP 500 racing was popular , Suzuki took inspiration from world champion Freddie Spencer and his style of racing . The game 's soundtrack was written by Hiroshi Kawaguchi , who used rock music that was uncommon in arcade games at the time . Hang-On was very popular at launch and sold well for Sega . Several sequels were later made for arcade , as well as video game consoles . It received positive critical reception , despite some initial concerns in Japan , and has been recognized as a well-remembered and influential arcade game .",

If you touch one monster or run out of time then you lose a life . The game ends if all lives are lost . There are 50 distinct levels , called rounds in the game , even though the counter goes to 99 ( the 100th level does not show ) . The player can play through the levels loops infinitely , with no apparent end .

An animated version of Ishino also appeared on the title screen and during the bonus rounds .",
