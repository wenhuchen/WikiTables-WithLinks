  "/wiki/City_of_License": "In American , Canadian and Philippine broadcasting , a city of license or community of license is the community that a radio station or television station is officially licensed to serve by that country 's broadcast regulator . In North American broadcast law , the concept of community of license dates to the early days of AM radio broadcasting . The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a main studio within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in U.S. law as early as 1939 . Various specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill public policy objectives of broadcast localism , both in radio and later also in television , based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers .",

It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz , the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves . Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples : kilohertz ( 103 Hz , kHz ) , megahertz ( 106 Hz , MHz ) , gigahertz ( 109 Hz , GHz ) , terahertz ( 1012 Hz , THz ) , petahertz ( 1015 Hz , PHz ) , exahertz ( 1018 Hz , EHz ) , and zettahertz ( 1021 Hz , ZHz ) . Some of the unit 's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones , particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications . It is also used to describe the clock speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven . The units are sometimes also used as a representation of energy , via the photon energy equation ( E=h\u03bd ) , with one hertz equivalent to h joules .",
