  "/wiki/United_States_Football_League": "The United States Football League ( USFL ) was an American football league that played for three seasons , 1983 through 1985 . The league played a spring/summer schedule in each of its active seasons . The 1986 season was scheduled to be played in the autumn/winter , directly competing against the long-established National Football League ( NFL ) . However , the USFL ceased operations before that season was scheduled to begin . The ideas behind the USFL were conceived in 1965 by New Orleans businessman David Dixon , who saw a market for a professional football league that would play in the summer , when the National Football League and college football were in their off-season . Dixon had been a key player in the construction of the Louisiana Superdome and the expansion of the NFL into New Orleans in 1967 . He developed The Dixon Plan - a blueprint for the USFL based upon securing NFL-caliber stadiums in top TV markets , securing a national TV broadcast contract , and controlling spending - and found investors willing to buy in . Though the original franchise owners and founders of the USFL had promised to abide by the general guidelines set out by Dixon 's plan , problems arose before the teams took the field , with some franchises facing financial problems and instability from the beginning . Due to pressure from the NFL , some franchises had difficulty securing leases in stadiums that were also used by NFL teams , forcing them to scramble to find alternate venues in their chosen city or hurriedly move to a new market . The USFL had no hard salary cap , and because of this , some teams quickly escalated player payrolls to unsustainable levels despite pledges to keep costs under control . While a handful of USFL franchises abided by the Dixon Plan and were relatively stable , others suffered repeated financial crises , and there were many franchise relocations , mergers , and ownership changes during the league 's short existence ; however , none of its teams actually folded during any given season . These problems were worsened as some owners began engaging in bidding wars for star players against NFL teams and each other , forcing other owners to do the same or face a competitive disadvantage .",

It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster , making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America , after the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) . The AFL played a proprietary code known as arena football , a form of indoor American football played on a 66-by-28 yard field ( about a quarter of the surface area of an NFL field ) , with rules encouraging offensive performance , resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game . The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster , a former executive of the United States Football League ( USFL ) and the NFL . From 2000 to 2009 , the AFL had its own developmental league , the af2 . The AFL played 22 seasons from 1987 to 2008 ; internal issues caused the league to cancel its 2009 season , though the af2 did play . Later that year both the AFL and af2 were dissolved and reorganized as a new corporation comprising teams from both leagues , and the AFL returned in 2010 . The league 's average game attendance after returning in 2010 was approximately 9,500 . The league historically had a nationwide footprint , and was recognized as the most prominent professional indoor football league in North America , offering higher payment , more widespread media exposure , and a longer history than competing leagues . From a high of 19 teams in 2007 , the league contracted to a low of four teams in 2018 , all in the northeastern United States . There were six teams playing in 2019 , the league 's final season .

The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 . The Green Bay Packers hold the most combined NFL championships with 13 , winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards .

At the same time the ABL was being formed , the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) was creating the Women 's National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) . The ABL began league competition in the Fall of 1996 , while the WNBA launched its first game in June 1997 . Both organizations came into existence during a surge in popularity for women 's basketball in the United States that followed the perfect 35-0 national championship season for the Connecticut Huskies in 1995 and the undefeated , gold medal-winning performance of the United States Women 's basketball team at the 1996 Summer Olympics . The ABL lasted two full seasons : 1996-97 and 1997-98 . The Atlanta Glory and Long Beach Stingrays folded prior to the start of the 1998-99 season , and were replaced by two expansion teams , the Chicago Condors and Nashville Noise . On December 22 , 1998 ; with almost no warning , the ABL declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and suspended operations . Each team had played between 12 and 15 games of the 1998-99 season . The ABL got off the ground before the WNBA , and at least early on its quality of play was higher than the rival league . This was partly due to the league 's signing of a majority of players from the 1996 USA women 's national team . Although the WNBA was bankrolled by the NBA , the ABL offered higher salaries . The two leagues did n't compete directly ; the ABL played during the winter while the WNBA played during the summer .",
  "/wiki/Chicago_Cougars": "The Chicago Cougars were a franchise in the World Hockey Association from 1972 to 1975 . The Cougars played their home games in the International Amphitheatre . During the 1974 Avco Cup Finals against Gordie Howe and the Houston Aeros , the team 's two home games were played at the Randhurst Twin Ice Arena in suburban Mount Prospect . This was because a presentation of Peter Pan starring gymnast Cathy Rigby was booked into the Amphitheatre when the National Hockey League 's Chicago Blackhawks and the National Basketball Association 's Chicago Bulls had both entered their own playoffs , making the Chicago Stadium unavailable for either the Cougars and Peter Pan . Just prior to their third season , the team was sold to Cougars players Ralph Backstrom and Dave Dryden , and player-coach Pat Stapleton after the original owners , Walter and Jordon Kaiser , were unable to secure funds to build a new arena . The land for the arena , originally named the O'Hare Sports Arena , was sold to the village of Rosemont and became the Rosemont Horizon ( now the Allstate Arena ) . This building is the now the home of the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League . They were placed in the Western Division for their first season ( 1972-73 ) and transferred to the Eastern Division for their final two seasons ( 1973-74 and 1974-75 ) when the Philadelphia Blazers moved to Vancouver .

It was the first major league to compete with the National Hockey League ( NHL ) since the collapse of the Western Hockey League in 1926 . Although the WHA was not the first league since that time to attempt to challenge the NHL 's supremacy , it was by far the most successful in the modern era . The WHA tried to capitalize on the lack of hockey teams in a number of major American cities and mid-level Canadian cities , and also hoped to attract the best players by paying more than NHL owners would . The WHA successfully challenged the NHL 's reserve clause , which bound players to their NHL teams even without a valid contract , allowing players in both leagues greater freedom of movement . Sixty-seven players jumped from the NHL to the WHA in the first year , led by star forward Bobby Hull , whose ten-year , $ 2.75 million contract was a record at the time . The WHA also took the initiative to sign European players . The WHA had an acrimonious relationship with the NHL , resulting in numerous legal battles , as well as competition for control of players and markets . In spite of this , merger talks began almost immediately , as the WHA was constantly unstable , with franchises occasionally relocating or folding in the middle of the season . NHL owners voted down a 1977 plan to merge six WHA teams ( the Edmonton Oilers , New England Whalers , Quebec Nordiques , Cincinnati Stingers , Houston Aeros , and Winnipeg Jets ) into the NHL before a 1979 merger was approved . As a result , the WHA ceased operations , and four teams joined the NHL for the 1979-80 season : the Edmonton Oilers , New England Whalers , Quebec Nordiques , and Winnipeg Jets . Of these four teams , two of the three Canadian teams - the Nordiques and Jets - eventually moved south to Denver and Phoenix , respectively , although the NHL would return to Winnipeg with the 2011 relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers , who would rename themselves the Winnipeg Jets upon their relocation .",

The XFL was operated as a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation ( now the WWE ) and NBC . The XFL was conceived as an outdoor football league that would begin play immediately after the National Football League season ended to take advantage of lingering public desire to watch football after the NFL and college football seasons had concluded . It was promoted as having fewer rules to encourage rougher play than other major leagues . The league had eight teams in two divisions , including major markets and some not directly served by the NFL , such as Birmingham , Las Vegas , Memphis , and Orlando . The XFL operated as a single entity with all teams owned by the league , in contrast to most major professional leagues , which use a franchise model with individual owners . Co-owner NBC served as the main carrier of XFL games , along with UPN and TNN . The presentation of XFL games featured sports entertainment elements inspired by professional wrestling , including heat and kayfabe , suggestively-dressed cheerleaders , and occasional usage of WWF personalities ( such as Jesse Ventura , Jim Ross , and Jerry Lawler ) as part of on-air commentary crews alongside sportscasters and veteran football players . Despite the wrestling influence , the games and their outcomes were legitimate . The first night of play brought higher television viewership than NBC had projected , but ratings quickly nosedived . The league developed a negative reputation due to its connections to professional wrestling and the WWF , the overall quality of play , and a presentation that differed starkly from network football telecasts of the era ( albeit featuring on-air innovations that would later become commonplace in football telecasts , such as aerial skycams and on-player microphones ) .
