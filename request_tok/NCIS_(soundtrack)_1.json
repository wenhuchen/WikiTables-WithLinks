  "/wiki/Bob_Dylan": "Bob Dylan ( born Robert Allen Zimmerman ; May 24 , 1941 ) is an American singer-songwriter , author , and visual artist who has been a major figure in popular culture for more than fifty years . Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s , when songs such as Blowin ' in the Wind ( 1963 ) and The Times They Are a-Changin ' ( 1964 ) became anthems for the civil rights movement and anti-war movement . His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political , social , philosophical , and literary influences , defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture . Following his self-titled debut album in 1962 , which mainly comprised traditional folk songs , Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan the following year . The album featured Blowin ' in the Wind and the thematically complex A Hard Rain 's a- Gon na Fall . For many of these songs , he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs . He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin ' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964 . In 1965 and 1966 , Dylan encountered controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation , and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s : Bringing It All Back Home ( 1965 ) , Highway 61 Revisited ( 1965 ) and Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) . Commenting on the six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone ( 1965 ) , Rolling Stone wrote : No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time , for all time . In July 1966 , Dylan withdrew from touring after being injured in a motorcycle accident . During this period , he recorded a large body of songs with members of The Band , who had previously backed him on tour . These recordings were released as the collaborative album The Basement Tapes in 1975 .",

He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater . He is best known for the pithy and humorous songs that he recorded in the 1950s and 1960s . His songs often parodied popular musical forms , though he usually created original melodies when doing so . A notable exception is The Elements , in which he set the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the Major-General 's Song from Gilbert and Sullivan 's Pirates of Penzance . Lehrer 's early work typically dealt with non-topical subject matter and was noted for its black humor in songs such as Poisoning Pigeons in the Park . In the 1960s , he produced a number of songs that dealt with social and political issues of the day , particularly when he wrote for the U.S. version of the television show That Was the Week That Was . The popularity of these songs has far outlasted their topical subjects and references . Lehrer quoted a friend 's explanation : Always predict the worst and you 'll be hailed as a prophet . In the early 1970s , Lehrer largely retired from public performances to devote his time to teaching mathematics and musical theater history at the University of California , Santa Cruz .",
