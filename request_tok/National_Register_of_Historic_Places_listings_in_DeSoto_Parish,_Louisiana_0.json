  "/wiki/U.S._Route_171": "U.S. Highway 171 ( US 171 ) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System and the only route within that system currently located entirely within the state of Louisiana . It spans 177.44 miles ( 285.56 km ) [ a ] in a north-south direction from the junction of US 90 and Louisiana Highway 14 ( LA 14 ) in Lake Charles to the junction of US 79/US 80 and LA 3094 in Shreveport . As its designation indicates , US 171 is numbered as a spur of US 71 , the principal north-south U.S. Highway through Shreveport , though they technically do not intersect . US 171 traverses six of the seven parishes along the Texas state line , the only exception being Cameron Parish located on the Gulf of Mexico south of Lake Charles . The route connects all six parish seats as it travels through the thick pine forests of western Louisiana on a wide four-lane right-of-way . The northern half of the route serves as the only major north-south corridor between Interstate 49 ( I-49 ) to the east and the Toledo Bend Reservoir along the state line to the west . Between the metropolitan areas at each terminus , US 171 passes through the smaller cities of DeRidder , Leesville , and Mansfield , as well as the towns of Rosepine , Many , Zwolle , and Stonewall . Along the way , the highway has interchanges with many of the state 's major east-west routes , including Interstate 10 ( I-10 ) , US 190 , LA 28 , US 84 , and I-20 . US 171 was created as one of the original routes of the numbered U.S. Highway system in November 1926 . Its only major alignment change occurred in 1937 , when the highway was shifted from what is now LA 175 between Many and Mansfield . Improvements over the years have included the paving of the entire route during the early 1930s , the elimination of many at-grade railroad crossings during the remainder of the decade , and the widening of the highway to four lanes through its urban areas during the 1960s and 1970s . Four-laning of the entire route was accomplished between 1990 and 2010 via the state 's massive TIMED program with the goal of improving safety and promoting economic development along the corridor .",

It is the 31st most extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States . Louisiana is bordered by the state of Texas to the west , Arkansas to the north , Mississippi to the east , and the Gulf of Mexico to the south . A large part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the Mississippi River . Louisiana is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes , which are equivalent to counties . The state 's capital is Baton Rouge , and its largest city is New Orleans . Much of the state 's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River , leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp . [ self-published source ] These contain a rich southern biota ; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets . There are also many species of tree frogs , and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish . In more elevated areas , fire is a natural process in the landscape and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas . These support an exceptionally large number of plant species , including many species of terrestrial orchids and carnivorous plants . Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state , including four that are federally recognized , ten that are state recognized , and four that have not received recognition .",

Located in the South Central region , Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east , Arkansas to the northeast , Oklahoma to the north , New Mexico to the west , and the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas to the southwest , and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast . Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S. , while San Antonio is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas-Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , respectively . Other major cities include Austin , the second-most populous state capital in the U.S. , and El Paso . Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic , and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from Mexico . The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word taysha , which means friends in the Caddo language . Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10% of Texas 's land area is desert . Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend . The term six flags over Texas [ note 1 ] refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory .",
