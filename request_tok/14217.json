The Olympic sport of athletics is split into four distinct sets of events : track and field events , road running events , and racewalking events . Both men and women had very similar schedules of events . Men competed in 24 events and women in 23 , as their schedule lacked the 50 km race walk . In addition , both the men 's 110 m hurdles and decathlon are reflected in the women 's schedule by the 100 m hurdles and heptathlon , respectively . The Olympic record was broken in 17 returning events . In five events , including the inaugural women 's 3000 m steeplechase , the world record was broken . The athletics was , alongside the Olympic cycling events , one of the few large sports programmes in which the host nation fared comparatively poorly in terms of medals won . Despite a haul of 100 medals at the games as a whole , Chinese athletes took home two bronze medals from the athletics events . The country 's foremost athlete Liu Xiang , the 2004 Olympic champion in the 110 metres hurdles , had to withdraw after a false start due to injury . In the years following the events , results were significantly affected by doping findings ; 19 of the 47 events have had amendments to their medal rankings as a result of testing and retesting of samples taken at or before the Games . Multiple medalists have been sanctioned for doping violations .",
