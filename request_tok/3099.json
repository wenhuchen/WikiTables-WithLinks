  "/wiki/Fort_Ruby": "Fort Ruby , also known as Camp Ruby , was built in 1862 by the United States Army , during the American Civil War , in the wilderness of eastern Nevada . It protected the overland mail coaches and Pony Express , in order to maintain links and communication between residents of California and the Union . It was operated 1862 to 1869 , in territory dominated by bands of the Western Shoshone . The fort was located at the east entrance to the Overland Pass from Ruby Valley , near Hobson on the west side of Ruby Lake . To secure access and safe passage through this area , as well as to provide for construction of railroads and other needs , the US signed the Treaty of Ruby Valley with twelve chiefs of the Western Shoshone , who did not cede any territory . The US also gained permission to conduct gold mining in this territory , as it needed gold in order to wage war against the Confederacy . It promised payments of annuities of $ 5000 annually for 20 years to the Western Shoshone , in the form of goods and livestock , but failed to make any payments after the first year . The site , which at the time contained several surviving log buildings , was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961 . Two of the four landmarked buildings on the site burned in a fire in 1992 . Since the log structures were in poor condition when this site was designated as a Landmark , and they have been altered and deteriorated significantly since designation , continued landmark status is under review by the Department of Interior . The site was transferred from private ownership to federal control in 2002 . Since then a joint archaeological venture to explore Fort Ruby 's frontier legacy has been conducted by the U.S .",

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",
  "/wiki/Overland_Trail": "The Overland Trail ( also known as the Overland Stage Line ) was a stagecoach and wagon trail in the American West during the 19th century . While portions of the route had been used by explorers and trappers since the 1820s , the Overland Trail was most heavily used in the 1860s as an alternative route to the Oregon , California , and Mormon trails through central Wyoming . The Overland Trail was famously used by the Overland Stage Company owned by Ben Holladay to run mail and passengers to Salt Lake City , Utah , via stagecoaches in the early 1860s . Starting from Atchison , Kansas , the trail descended into Colorado before looping back up to southern Wyoming and rejoining the Oregon Trail at Fort Bridger . The stage line operated until 1869 when the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad eliminated the need for mail service via Thais ' stagecoach .",
  "/wiki/Hoover_Dam": "Hoover Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River , on the border between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona . It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30 , 1935 , by President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers , and cost over one hundred lives . Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933 , it was officially renamed Hoover Dam , for President Herbert Hoover , by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947 . Since about 1900 , the Black Canyon and nearby Boulder Canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods , provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power . In 1928 , Congress authorized the project . The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies , Inc. , which began construction of the dam in early 1931 . Such a large concrete structure had never been built before , and some of the techniques were unproven . The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties . Nevertheless , Six Companies turned the dam over to the federal government on March 1 , 1936 , more than two years ahead of schedule . Hoover Dam impounds Lake Mead , the largest reservoir in the United States by volume ( when it is full ) .

  "/wiki/Gravity-arch_dam": "An arch-gravity dam or arched dam is a dam with the characteristics of both an arch dam and a gravity dam . It is a dam that curves upstream in a narrowing curve that directs most of the water pressure against the canyon rock walls , providing the force to compress the dam . It combines the strengths of two common dam forms and is considered a compromise between the two . They are made of conventional concrete , Roller Compacted Concrete ( RCC ) , or masonry . Arch-gravity dams are not reinforced except at the spillway . A typical example of the conventional concrete dam is the Hoover Dam . Changuinola Dam is an example of the RCC arch-gravity dam . A gravity dam requires a large volume of internal fill . An arch-gravity dam can be thinner than the pure gravity dam and requires less internal fill .",
  "/wiki/Colorado_River": "The Colorado River is one of the principal rivers ( along with the Rio Grande ) in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico . The 1,450-mile-long ( 2,330 km ) river drains an expansive , arid watershed that encompasses parts of seven U.S. states and two Mexican states . Starting in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado , the river flows generally southwest across the Colorado Plateau and through the Grand Canyon before reaching Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border , where it turns south toward the international border . After entering Mexico , the Colorado approaches the mostly dry Colorado River Delta at the tip of the Gulf of California between Baja California and Sonora . Known for its dramatic canyons , whitewater rapids , and eleven U.S. National Parks , the Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people . The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts , which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and domestic water supply . Its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power , and its major dams regulate peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West . Intensive water consumption has dried up the lower 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the river , which has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s . Beginning with small bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers , Native Americans have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years . Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago , the watershed was home to large agricultural civilizations - considered some of the most sophisticated indigenous North American cultures - which eventually declined due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices . Most native peoples that inhabit the region today are descended from other groups that settled there beginning about 1,000 years ago . Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16th century , when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area , which became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821 .",
  "/wiki/Concrete": "Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement ( cement paste ) that hardens ( cures ) over time . In the past limebased cement binders were often used , such as lime putty , but sometimes with other hydraulic cements , such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete ( for its visual resemblance to Portland stone ) . Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with different methods of binding aggregate together , including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder , which is frequently used for road surfaces , and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder . When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water , the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape . The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses . Often , additives ( such as pozzolans or superplasticizers ) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material . Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials ( such as rebar ) embedded to provide tensile strength , yielding reinforced concrete . Because concrete cures ( which is not the same as drying such as with paint ) how concrete is handled after it is poured is just as important as before . Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials . Its usage worldwide , ton for ton , is twice that of steel , wood , plastics , and aluminum combined . Globally , the ready-mix concrete industry , the largest segment of the concrete market , is projected to exceed $ 600 billion in revenue by 2025 . Concrete is distinct from mortar .",

  "/wiki/McKeen_Motor_Car_Company": "The McKeen Motor Car Company of Omaha , Nebraska , was a builder of internal combustion-engined railroad motor cars ( railcars ) , constructing 152 between 1905-1917 . Founded by William McKeen , the Union Pacific Railroad 's Superintendent of Motive Power and Machinery , the company was essentially an offshoot of the Union Pacific and the first cars were constructed by the UP before McKeen leased shop space in the UP 's Omaha Shops in Omaha , Nebraska . The UP had asked him to develop a way of running small passenger trains more economically and McKeen produced a design that was ahead of its time . Unfortunately , internal combustion engine technology was not and the McKeen cars never found a truly reliable powerplant . The vast majority of the cars produced were for E. H. Harriman 's empire of lines ( Union Pacific , Southern Pacific and others ) . Harriman 's death in 1909 lost the company its major sponsor and investor and Harriman 's successors were less enthusiastic about the McKeen cars . Many McKeen cars ended up being re-engined with a variety of drive mechanisms - gasoline-mechanical , gasoline-electric , diesel-electric or even steam power . Most , although not all , McKeen cars had the distinctive wind-splitter pointed aerodynamic front end and rounded tail . The porthole windows were also a McKeen trademark , adopted allegedly for strength after the 7th production car . A dropped central door , as pictured , was also present on the majority of the cars . Two lengths , 55 and 70 feet , were offered ; either could be fitted out with a large mail and express area ahead of the center doors , a smaller mail/express area , or the car could be all seats for a maximum capacity of 64 or 105 respectively .",

Self-propelled passenger vehicles also capable of hauling a train are , in technical rail usage , more usually called rail motor coaches or motor cars ( not to be confused with the motor cars , otherwise known as automobiles , that operate on roads ) . The term is sometimes also used as an alternative name for the small types of multiple unit which consist of more than one coach . That is the general usage nowadays in Ireland when referring to any diesel multiple unit ( DMU ) , or in some cases electric multiple unit ( EMU ) . In North America the term railcar has a much broader sense and can be used ( as an abbreviated form of railroad car ) to refer to any item of hauled rolling-stock , whether passenger coaches or goods wagons ( freight cars ) .

  "/wiki/Newlands_Reclamation_Act": "The Reclamation Act ( also known as the Lowlands Reclamation Act or National Reclamation Act ) of 1902 ( Pub.L . 57-161 ) is a United States federal law that funded irrigation projects for the arid lands of 20 states in the American West . The act at first covered only 13 of the western states as Texas had no federal lands . Texas was added later by a special act passed in 1906 . The act set aside money from sales of semi-arid public lands for the construction and maintenance of irrigation projects . The newly irrigated land would be sold and money would be put into a revolving fund that supported more such projects . This led to the eventual damming of nearly every major western river . [ citation needed ] Under the act , the Secretary of the Interior created the United States Reclamation Service within the United States Geological Survey to administer the program . In 1907 , the Service became a separate organization within the Department of the Interior and was renamed the United States Bureau of Reclamation . The Act was drafted by Democratic Congressional Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada . Many of the loans made to farmers , funded by the sales of federal land , were never repaid .

Declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961 , the district is one of only six in the state of Nevada . Virginia City was the prototype for future frontier mining boom towns , with its industrialization and urbanization . It owed its success to the 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode . The town is laid out in a grid pattern 1,500 feet below the top of Mount Davidson . Most of the buildings are two to three story brick buildings , with the first floors used for saloons and shops . Virginia City was the first silver rush town , and the first to intensely apply large-scale industrial mining methods . After a year in existence , the boomtown had 42 saloons , 42 stores , 6 restaurants , 3 hotels , and 868 dwellings to house a town residency of 2,345 . At its height in 1863 , the town had 15,000 residents . From its creation in 1859 to 1875 , there were five widespread fires . The 1875 fire , dubbed the Great Fire of 1875 , caused $ 12,000,000 in damages . Virginia City continues to attract over 2 million visitors per year .",

  "/wiki/Comstock_Lode": "The Comstock Lode is a lode of silver ore located under the eastern slope of Mount Davidson , a peak in the Virginia Range in Virginia City , Nevada ( then western Utah Territory ) , which was the first major discovery of silver ore in the United States and named after American miner Henry Comstock . After the discovery was made public in 1859 , it sparked a silver rush of prospectors to the area , scrambling to stake their claims . The discovery caused considerable excitement in California and throughout the United States , the greatest since the California Gold Rush in 1849 . Mining camps soon thrived in the vicinity , which became bustling commercial centers , including Virginia City and Gold Hill . The Comstock Lode is notable not just for the immense fortunes it generated and the large role those fortunes had in the growth of Nevada and San Francisco , but also for the advances in mining technology that it spurred , such as square set timbering and the Washoe process for extracting silver from ore . The mines declined after 1874 , although underground mining continued sporadically into the 1920s ."
