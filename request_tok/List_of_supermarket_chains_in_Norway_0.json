  "/wiki/Holding_company": "A holding company is a company that owns other companies ' outstanding stock . A holding company usually does not produce goods or services itself ( with no eponymous consumer-facing brand at most times ) ; rather , its purpose is to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group . However , in many jurisdiction of the world , holding companies are usually termed as parent companies who besides holding stock in other companies can conduct trade and other business activities itself . Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies . Holding companies are also created to hold assets such as IP and trade secrets that are protected from the operation company . This creates a smaller risk when it comes to litigation . In the United States , 80% of stock , in voting and value , must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed . That is , if Company A owns 80% or more of the stock of Company B , Company A will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders , as the payment of dividends from B to A is essentially transferring cash from one company to the other . Any other shareholders of Company B will pay the usual taxes on dividends , as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these shareholders . Sometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding Holding or Holdings to its name .",
