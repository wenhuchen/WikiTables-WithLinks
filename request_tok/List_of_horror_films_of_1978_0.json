As a result , the role went to Dunaway , who had just won an Oscar for her performance in Network .

She sang it on the soundtrack and garnered a moderate hit as a result ( the record peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 ) .

The plot tells about a mental patient who was committed to a sanitarium for murdering his teenage sister on Halloween night . Fifteen years later , he escapes and returns to his hometown , where he stalks a female babysitter and her friends , while under pursuit by his psychiatrist . Filming took place in Southern California in May 1978 , before premiering in October , where it grossed $ 70 million , becoming one of the most profitable independent films . Primarily praised for Carpenter 's direction and score , many credit the film as the first in a long line of slasher films inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho ( 1960 ) . Some critics have suggested that Halloween may encourage sadism and misogyny by audiences identifying with its villain . Others have suggested that the film is a social critique of the immorality of youth and teenagers in 1970s America , with many of Myers ' victims being sexually promiscuous substance abusers , and the lone heroine is depicted as innocent and pure , hence her survival . Carpenter dismisses such analyses . Halloween spawned a film franchise comprising eleven films which helped construct an extensive backstory for its antagonist Michael Myers , sometimes narratively diverging entirely from previous installments . A remake was released in 2007 , which was followed by a sequel in 2009 . An eleventh installment , which serves as a direct sequel to the original film that retcons all previous sequels , was released in 2018 .

It also stars Joseph Mascolo , Jeffrey Kramer , Collin Wilcox , Ann Dusenberry , Mark Gruner , Susan French , Barry Coe , Donna Wilkes , and Gary Springer . The plot concerns Chief Brody suspecting another great white shark is terrorizing the fictional sea side resort of Amity Island following a series of incidents and disappearances and his suspicions are eventually proven true . Like the production of the original film , the production of Jaws 2 was troubled . The first director for the film , John D. Hancock , proved to be unsuitable for an action film and was replaced by Szwarc . Scheider , who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal , was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc . Jaws 2 was briefly the highest-grossing sequel in history until Rocky II was released in 1979 . The film 's tagline , Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water . has become one of the most famous in film history and has been parodied and homaged several times .
