  "/wiki/\u010cern\u00e9_jezero": "\u010cern\u00e9 jezero in the Bohemian Forest is the largest and deepest natural lake in the Czech Republic . This triangular lake surrounded with spruce forest is located about 6 km northwest of \u017delezn\u00e1 Ruda under a 300-metre-high cliff on Jezern\u00ed hora ( 1,343 m ) . It is of glacial origin , a product of the W\u00fcrm glaciation . The water in the lake is oligotrophic . There is a natural outflow through \u010cern\u00fd potok , a short stream which is a tributary of the \u00dahlava River . The main European water divide runs across the mountain just above the lake . As a consequence , \u010cern\u00e9 jezero belongs to the water basin of the Elbe , which finds the North Sea , while \u010certovo jezero just 2 km away drains into the Danube and thence the Black Sea . The oldest pumped-storage hydroelectric plant in the Czech Republic ( built 1929-1930 ) is located here ; the lake serves as its upper reservoir .",

  "/wiki/B\u00edlina_River": "The B\u00edlina ( Czech pronunciation : [ \u02c8bi\u02d0l\u026ana ] ; German : Biela ) rises on the slopes of the Ore Mountains in the Czech Republic , north of Chomutov . The river flows between the Czech Central Mountains and the Ore Mountains to the north-east , and empties into the Elbe in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem . The catchment area of the river covers an area of 1,082 km\u00b2 , and its total length is 82.0 km . In the upper part it flows through a man-made riverbed which was created when lignite mining in the area around Most started . At the same time , the former Lake Komo\u0159any was drained . A substantial part of the flow was extracted for use in chemical plants in Z\u00e1lu\u017e\u00ed u Litv\u00ednova . The highly polluted output killed all fish . The situation improved significantly during the 1990s . The flow rate is currently artificially increased by redirection of water from the catchment area of the Oh\u0159e . However , the B\u00edlina is still one of the most polluted rivers in the Czech Republic . For most of the river 's length it flows through open , treeless countryside . The river bed is 5 to 10 metres wide , mostly regulated .",
