It is the seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",

Located on Angola 's northern coast with the Atlantic Ocean , Luanda is both Angola 's chief seaport and its administrative centre . It is also the capital city of Luanda Province . Luanda and its metropolitan area is the most populous Portuguese-speaking capital city in the world , with over 8 million inhabitants in 2019 ( a third of Angola 's population ) . Among the oldest colonial cities of Africa , it was founded in January 1576 as S\u00e3o Paulo da Assun\u00e7\u00e3o de Loanda by Portuguese explorer Paulo Dias de Novais . The city served as the centre of the slave trade to Brazil before its prohibition . At the start of the Angolan Civil War in 1975 , most of the white Portuguese left as refugees , principally for Portugal . Luanda 's population increased greatly from refugees fleeing the war , but its infrastructure was inadequate to handle the increase . This also caused the exacerbation of slums , or musseques , around Luanda . The city is currently undergoing a major reconstruction , with many large developments taking place that will alter its cityscape significantly . The industries present in the city include the processing of agricultural products , beverage production , textile , cement , newly car assembly plants , construction materials , plastics , metallurgy , cigarettes and shoes .",

Cameroon is home to over 250 native languages spoken by nearly 20 million people . The official languages of the country are English and French . Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest . Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camar\u00f5es ( Shrimp River ) , which became Cameroon in English . Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century , and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms .

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French .

The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish .

During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus .

  "/wiki/Spanish_language": "Spanish ( /\u02c8sp\u00e6n\u026a\u0283/ ( listen ) ; espa\u00f1ol ( help\u00b7info ) ) , or Castilian ( /k\u00e6\u02c8st\u026ali\u0259n/ ( listen ) , castellano ( help\u00b7info ) ) , is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula and today has over 483 million native speakers , mainly in Spain and the Americas . It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",

Located on the equator , Gabon is bordered by Equatorial Guinea to the northwest , Cameroon to the north , the Republic of the Congo on the east and south , and the Gulf of Guinea to the west . It has an area of nearly 270,000 square kilometres ( 100,000 sq mi ) and its population is estimated at 2.1 million people . Its capital and largest city is Libreville . Since its independence from France in 1960 , the sovereign state of Gabon has had three presidents . In the early 1990s , Gabon introduced a multi-party system and a new democratic constitution that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and reformed many governmental institutions . Abundant petroleum and foreign private investment have helped make Gabon one of the most prosperous countries in Sub-Saharan Africa , with the 7th highest HDI and the fourth highest GDP per capita ( PPP ) ( after Mauritius , Equatorial Guinea and Seychelles ) in the region . GDP grew by more than 6% per year from 2010 to 2012 . However , because of inequality in income distribution , a significant proportion of the population remains poor .",

It consists of two archipelagos around the two main islands of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe , about 140 km ( 87 mi ) apart and about 250 and 225 km ( 155 and 140 mi ) off the northwestern coast of Gabon , respectively . The islands were uninhabited until their discovery by Portuguese explorers in the 15th century . Gradually colonized and settled by the Portuguese throughout the 16th century , they collectively served as a vital commercial and trade center for the Atlantic slave trade . The rich volcanic soil and close proximity to the Equator made S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe ideal for sugar cultivation , followed later by cash crops such as coffee and cocoa ; the lucrative plantation economy was heavily dependent upon imported African slaves . Cycles of social unrest and economic instability throughout the 19th and 20th centuries culminated in peaceful independence in 1975 . S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has since remained one of Africa 's most stable and democratic countries . With a population of 201,800 ( 2018 official estimate ) , S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is the second-smallest African sovereign state after Seychelles , as well as the smallest Portuguese-speaking country . Its people are predominantly of African and mesti\u00e7o descent , with most practicing Roman Catholicism . The legacy of Portuguese rule is also visible in the country 's culture , customs , and music , which fuse European and African influences .

S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe signed a deal with Portugal in 2009 , linking the dobra with the euro . The exchange rate was fixed at 1 EUR = 24,500 STD on 1 January 2010 , which means that the new dobra is pegged to the euro at \u20ac1 = 24.5 STN / nDb . The name derives from Portuguese d\u00f3bra , meaning doubloon ."
