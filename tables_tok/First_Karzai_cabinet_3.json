  "section_text": "In March 2008 , Karzai replaced the minister of counternarcotics by his deputy , General Khodaidad . [ 18 ] Half a year later , Karzai sacked his interior minister Zarar Ahmed Moqbel . Moqbel was widely accused of corruption and incompetence , and i.a . Britain had lobbied for his sacking . [ 19 ] He was replaced by Education Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar . [ 20 ] Atmar was appointed by president Karzai on 11 October 2008 , and approved by Parliament on 20 October 2008 . The same day the Afghan Parliament approved the appointment of Ghulam Farooq Wardak to the old portfolio of Atmar . Wardak was previously as minister of Parliamentary Affairs the liaison between the Afghan legislature and the executive . Also Muhammad Asif Rahimi was named as new minister of Agriculture . At the same time , Karzai appointed Zarar Ahmad Muqbal as new Minister of Refugees and Repatriation , and named Assadullah Khalid as Wardak 's successor as ministry of Parliamentary Affairs . However , both rejected their positions . Therefore , as few days later Karzai decided to name the incumbent minister of Border and Tribal Affairs , Abdul Karim Barahwy as minister of Refugees made Assadullah Khalid his successor . [ 21 ] In late 2008 Karzai replaced his Commerce minister , naming deputy Finance Minister Wahidullah Shahrani for the post . Karzai also replaced the minister of transport around this time . In a 10 November 2008 cabinet meeting , President Karzai abruptly dismissed Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Hamidullah Qaderi on the charge that Qaderi had mishandled preparations for 2008 Hajj travel . Hajj flights from Afghan cities were to begin 8 November . However , the Saudi- Malaysian joint venture NAS/Global charter airline with which Minister Qaderi contracted for flights said it could not provide planes to transport Afghan pilgrims to Saudi Arabia , perhaps because of a late Afghan contract payment . President Karzai has asked the Attorney General to investigate Qaderi for corruption and appointed his chief economic advisor Omar Zakhilwal as acting Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation and head of the Hajj committee . [ 22 ] After Finance Minister Anwar AlHaq Ahadi resigned his post in 2009 to make a run for the next presidential elections , Karzai named Zakhilwal as the new minister of Finance , and made Hamidullah Faruqi the new minister of Transport . Zakhilwal was named as the new finance minister on 7 February 2009 and was approved by the Parliament on 3 March 2009 .",
