  "intro": "Almost 175 athletes across 15 different sports competed for Wales at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, between 3 October and 14 October 2010. In order to send a team to the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Wales needed to raise \u00a3500,000. For this the Commonwealth Games Council for Wales established a scheme called the Friends of Commonwealth Games in Wales, in which individuals and small businesses could contribute a minimum of \u00a31000 in the four years leading up to the Commonwealth Games. The Queen's Baton toured Wales, beginning in north Wales on 9 November 2009, and going on to mid and west Wales on 10 November and to south Wales on 11 November. The chef de mission for the Welsh team was Chris Jenkins whilst the overall team captain was weightlifter Michaela Breeze. Of the original selections only cyclist Geraint Thomas (health issues) and decathlete David Guest (injury) did not travel to Delhi. Jazmin Carlin and Becky James were the only team members to win more than one medal. Each won a silver and a bronze. In his seventh Commonwealth Games appearance bowls player Rob Weale won his second gold medal, his first having been 24 years earlier in 1986. The medals won in Delhi raised Wales' all-time medal tally at the Commonwealth Games to 235 (52 gold, 76 silver, 107 bronze)."
