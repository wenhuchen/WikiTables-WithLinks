The sites are judged to be important for the collective and preservative interests of humanity . To be selected , a World Heritage Site must be an already-classified landmark , unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance ( such as an ancient ruin or historical structure , building , city , complex , desert , forest , island , lake , monument , mountain , or wilderness area ) . It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity , and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet . The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity , which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing , unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access , or threat from local administrative negligence . Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones . The list is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee , composed of 21 states parties that are elected by their General Assembly . The programme catalogues , names , and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common culture and heritage of humanity . Under certain conditions , listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund . The programme began with the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World 's Cultural and Natural Heritage , which was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972 . Since then , 193 state parties have ratified the convention , making it one of the most widely recognised international agreements and the world 's most popular cultural programme . In 1978 the city of Quito earned the distinction of being the first city in the world to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site .",
  "/wiki/Hectare": "The hectare ( /\u02c8h\u025bkt\u025b\u0259r , -t\u0251\u02d0r/ ; SI symbol : ha ) is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with 100-metre sides ( 1 hm2 ) , or 10,000 m2 , and is primarily used in the measurement of land . There are 100 hectares in one square kilometre . An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres . In 1795 , when the metric system was introduced , the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( hecto- + are ) was thus 100 ares or \u200b1\u2044100 km2 ( 10,000 square metres ) . When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960 , resulting in the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are was not included as a recognised unit . The hectare , however , remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is expected to continue indefinitely . Though the dekare/decare daa ( 1,000 m2 ) and are a ( 100 m2 ) are not officially accepted for use , they are still used in some contexts .",

In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use , but they differ by only two parts per million : see below . The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land . Traditionally , in the Middle Ages , an acre was defined as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen .",

At its height , Ani was one of the world 's largest cities , with a possible population of circa 100,000 . Renowned for its splendor , Ani was sacked by the Mongols in 1236 . Ani never recovered from a devastating 1319 earthquake , and was gradually abandoned until it was largely forgotten by the 17th-century .

With each of the two contemporary powers in the region - the Abbasids and Byzantines - too preoccupied to concentrate their forces in subjugating the people of the region , and with the dissipation of several of the Armenian nakharar noble families , Ashot succeeded in asserting himself as the leading figure of a movement to dislodge the Arabs from Armenia . Ashot 's prestige rose as both Byzantine and Arab leaders - eager to maintain a buffer state near their frontiers - courted him . The Abbasid Caliphate recognized Ashot as prince of princes in 862 and , later on , as king ( in 884 or 885 ) . The establishment of the Bagratuni kingdom later led to the founding of several other Armenian principalities and kingdoms : Taron , Vaspurakan , Kars , Khachen and Syunik . Unity among all these states was sometimes difficult to maintain while the Byzantines and Arabs lost no time in exploiting the kingdom 's situation to their own gains . [ citation needed ] During the reign of Ashot III ( 732 to 748 ) , Ani became the kingdom 's capital and grew into a thriving economic and cultural center . The first half of the 11th century saw the decline and eventual collapse of the kingdom . The Byzantine emperor Basil II ( r. 976-1025 ) won a string of victories and annexed parts of southwestern Armenia ; King Hovhannes-Smbat felt forced to cede his lands and in 1022 promised to will his kingdom to the Byzantines following his death . However , after Hovhannes-Smbat 's death in 1041 , his successor , Gagik II , refused to hand over Ani and continued resistance until 1045 , when his kingdom , plagued with internal and external threats , was finally taken by Byzantine forces .",
  "/wiki/Mongol_Empire": "The Mongol Empire existed during the 13th and 14th centuries , and was the largest contiguous land empire in history . Originating in Mongolia , the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe to the Sea of Japan , extending northward into parts of Siberia ; eastward and southward into the Indian subcontinent , Mainland Southeast Asia and the Iranian Plateau ; and westward as far as the Levant and the Carpathian Mountains . The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of several nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan ( c. 1162-1227 ) , whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206 . The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants , who sent out invading armies in every direction . The vast transcontinental empire connected the East with the West in an enforced Pax Mongolica , allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade , technologies , commodities and ideologies across Eurasia . The empire began to split due to wars over succession , as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir \u00d6gedei or from one of his other sons , such as Tolui , Chagatai , or Jochi . The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid factions , but disputes continued among the descendants of Tolui . A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary , cosmopolitan empire , or would stay true to the Mongol nomadic and steppe-based lifestyle . After M\u00f6ngke Khan died ( 1259 ) , rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors , the brothers Ariq B\u00f6ke and Kublai Khan , who fought each other in the Toluid Civil War ( 1260-1264 ) and also dealt with challenges from the descendants of other sons of Genghis . Kublai successfully took power , but civil war ensued as he sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and \u00d6gedeid families . During the reigns of Genghis and \u00d6gedei , the Mongols suffered the occasional defeat when a less skilled general received a command . The Siberian Tumeds defeated the Mongol forces under Borokhula around 1215-1217 ; Jalal al-Din defeated Shigi-Qutugu at the Battle of Parwan in 1221 ; and the Jin generals Heda and Pu ' a defeated Dolqolqu in 1230 .",
  "/wiki/Troy": "Troy ( Ancient Greek : \u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03af\u03b1 , Tro\u00eda , \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , \u00cdlion or \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 , \u00cdlios ; Latin : Troia and Ilium ; [ note 1 ] Hittite : \ud808\udf37\ud808\udcfe\ud808\uddfb\ud808\udead Wilusa or \ud808\udeeb\ud808\ude92\ud808\udd3f\ud808\udead Truwisa ; Turkish : Truva or Troya ) was a city in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity by its Roman provincial or regional names , Asia Minor ( lesser Asia ) , or Anatolia ( place of the rising sun ) now Anadolu in modern Turkey , just south of the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles strait and northwest of Mount Ida . The location in the present day is the hill of Hisarlik and its immediate vicinity . In modern scholarly nomenclature , the Ridge of Troy ( including Hisarlik ) borders the Plain of Troy , flat agricultural land , which conducts the lower Scamander River to the strait . Troy was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle , in particular in the Iliad , one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer . Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey suggests that the name \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ( Ilion ) formerly began with a digamma : \u03dc\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ( Wilion ) ; [ note 2 ] this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city , Wilusa . After a destruction at the end of the Bronze Age , believed to represent the end of the Trojan War , and a period of abandonment or near-abandonment during the subsequent Dark Age , the site acquired a new population of Greek-speakers , who built a classical city that became along with the rest of Anatolia a part of the Persian Empire . The Troad was liberated by Alexander the Great , an admirer of Achilles , who he believed had the same type of glorious ( but short-lived ) destiny . After the Roman conquest of this now Hellenistic Greek-speaking world , a new capital called Ilium ( from Greek : \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Ilion ) was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus . It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople , became a bishopric , was abandoned , repopulated for a few centuries in the Byzantine era , was abandoned again , and is now a Latin Catholic titular see . Most recently it has risen to prominence as an archaeological site . In the mid-19th century the Calvert family , wealthy Levantine English settlers of the Troad , occupying a working farm a few miles from Hisarlik , purchased much of the hill in the belief that it contained the ruins of Troy . They were antiquarians .",

The Iliad is set during the Trojan War , the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek kingdoms . It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war . The Odyssey focuses on the ten-year journey home of Odysseus , king of Ithaca , after the fall of Troy . Many accounts of Homer 's life circulated in classical antiquity , the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia , a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey . Modern scholars consider these accounts legendary . The Homeric Question - concerning by whom , when , where and under what circumstances the Iliad and Odyssey were composed - continues to be debated . Broadly speaking , modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups . One holds that most of the Iliad and ( according to some ) the Odyssey are the works of a single poet of genius . The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and reworking by many contributors , and that Homer is best seen as a label for an entire tradition . It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC . The poems are in Homeric Greek , also known as Epic Greek , a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries ; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic .",

Set during the Trojan War , the ten-year siege of the city of Troy ( Ilium ) by a coalition of Greek states , it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles . Although the story covers only a few weeks in the final year of the war , the Iliad mentions or alludes to many of the Greek legends about the siege ; the earlier events , such as the gathering of warriors for the siege , the cause of the war , and related concerns tend to appear near the beginning . Then the epic narrative takes up events prophesied for the future , such as Achilles ' imminent death and the fall of Troy , although the narrative ends before these events take place . However , as these events are prefigured and alluded to more and more vividly , when it reaches an end the poem has told a more or less complete tale of the Trojan War . The Iliad is paired with something of a sequel , the Odyssey , also attributed to Homer . Along with the Odyssey , the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature , and its written version is usually dated to around the 8th century BC . In the modern vulgate ( the standard accepted version ) , the Iliad contains 15,693 lines ; it is written in Homeric Greek , a literary amalgam of Ionic Greek and other dialects . According to Michael N. Nagler , the Iliad is a more complicated epic poem than the Odyssey .",

He wrote three of the most famous poems in Latin literature : the Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) , the Georgics , and the epic Aeneid . A number of minor poems , collected in the Appendix Vergiliana , are sometimes attributed to him . Virgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome 's greatest poets . His Aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome since the time of its composition . Modeled after Homer 's Iliad and Odyssey , the Aeneid follows the Trojan refugee Aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and reach Italy , where his descendants Romulus and Remus were to found the city of Rome .

It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter . The first six of the poem 's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas 's wanderings from Troy to Italy , and the poem 's second half tells of the Trojans ' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins , under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed . The hero Aeneas was already known to Greco-Roman legend and myth , having been a character in the Iliad . Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas 's wanderings , his vague association with the foundation of Rome and his description as a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas , and fashioned the Aeneid into a compelling founding myth or national epic that tied Rome to the legends of Troy , explained the Punic Wars , glorified traditional Roman virtues , and legitimized the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders , heroes , and gods of Rome and Troy . The Aeneid is widely regarded as Virgil 's masterpiece and one of the greatest works of Latin literature .",

It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct ( modern-day Bilecik Province ) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I . Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror . During the 16th and 17th centuries , at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a multinational , multilingual empire controlling most of Southeast Europe , parts of Central Europe , Western Asia , parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , North Africa and the Horn of Africa . At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . [ note 7 ] With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent , this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians . The empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy , society and military throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century . However , during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 , the Ottoman military system fell behind that of their European rivals , the Habsburg and Russian empires .",

The donated assets may be held by a charitable trust . The person making such dedication is known as waqif , a donor . In Ottoman Turkish law , and later under the British Mandate of Palestine , the waqf was defined as usufruct State land ( or property ) of which the State revenues are assured to pious foundations .

Hoodoos typically consist of relatively soft rock topped by harder , less easily eroded stone that protects each column from the elements . They generally form within sedimentary rock and volcanic rock formations . Hoodoos are found mainly in the desert in dry , hot areas . In common usage , the difference between hoodoos and pinnacles ( or spires ) is that hoodoos have a variable thickness often described as having a totem pole-shaped body . A spire , on the other hand , has a smoother profile or uniform thickness that tapers from the ground upward . An example of a single spire , as an earth pyramid , is found at Aultderg Burn , near Fochabers , Scotland . [ citation needed ] Hoodoos range in size from the height of an average human to heights exceeding a 10-story building . Hoodoo shapes are affected by the erosional patterns of alternating hard and softer rock layers .

The First Iconoclasm , as it is sometimes called , existed between about 726 and 787 . The Second Iconoclasm was between 814 and 842 . According to the traditional view , Byzantine Iconoclasm was started by a ban on religious images by Emperor Leo III and continued under his successors . It was accompanied by widespread destruction of images and persecution of supporters of the veneration of images . The pope remained firmly in support of the use of images throughout the period , and the whole episode widened the growing divergence between the Byzantine and Carolingian traditions in what was still a unified church , as well as facilitating the reduction or removal of Byzantine political control over parts of Italy . Iconoclasm is the deliberate destruction within a culture of the culture 's own religious icons and other symbols or monuments , usually for religious or political motives .

  "/wiki/Byzantine_art": "Byzantine art comprises the body of Christian Greek artistic products of the Eastern Roman ( Byzantine ) Empire , as well as the nations and states that inherited culturally from the empire . Though the empire itself emerged from the decline of Rome and lasted until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 , the start date of the Byzantine period is rather clearer in art history than in political history , if still imprecise . Many Eastern Orthodox states in Eastern Europe , as well as to some degree the Muslim states of the eastern Mediterranean , preserved many aspects of the empire 's culture and art for centuries afterward . A number of states contemporary with the Byzantine Empire were culturally influenced by it , without actually being part of it ( the Byzantine commonwealth ) . These included the Rus , as well as some non-Orthodox states like the Republic of Venice , which separated from the Byzantine empire in the 10th century , and the Kingdom of Sicily , which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire and had also been a Byzantine possession until the 10th century with a large Greek-speaking population persisting into the 12th century . Other states having a Byzantine artistic tradition had oscillated throughout the Middle Ages between being part of the Byzantine empire and having periods of independence , such as Serbia and Bulgaria . After the fall of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 1453 , art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the Ottoman Empire was often called post-Byzantine . Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire , particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture , are maintained in Greece , Cyprus , Serbia , Bulgaria , Romania , Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day .",

  "/wiki/Hittites": "The Hittites ( /\u02c8h\u026ata\u026ats/ ) were an Anatolian people who played an important role in establishing an empire centered on Hattusa in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC . This empire reached its height during the mid-14th century BC under Suppiluliuma I , when it encompassed an area that included most of Anatolia as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia . Between the 15th and 13th centuries BC , the Empire of Hattusa , conventionally called the Hittite Empire , came into conflict with the Egyptian Empire , Middle Assyrian Empire and the empire of the Mitanni for control of the Near East . The Assyrians eventually emerged as the dominant power and annexed much of the Hittite empire , while the remainder was sacked by Phrygian newcomers to the region . After c. 1180 BC , during the Bronze Age collapse , the Hittites splintered into several independent Neo-Hittite city-states , some of which survived until the 8th century BC before succumbing to the Neo-Assyrian Empire . The Hittite language was a distinct member of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family , and along with the related Luwian language , is the oldest historically attested Indo-European language , referred to by its speakers as ne\u0161ili in the language of Nesa . The Hittites called their country the Kingdom of Hattusa ( Hatti in Akkadian ) , a name received from the Hattians , an earlier people who inhabited the region until the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC and spoke an unrelated language known as Hattic . The conventional name Hittites is due to their initial identification with the Biblical Hittites in 19th century archaeology . The history of the Hittite civilization is known mostly from cuneiform texts found in the area of their kingdom , and from diplomatic and commercial correspondence found in various archives in Assyria , Babylonia , Egypt and the Middle East , the decipherment of which was also a key event in the history of Indo-European linguistics . The Hittite military made successful use of chariots . The development of iron smelting was once attributed to the Hittites of Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age , with their success largely based on the advantages of a monopoly on ironworking at the time . But the view of such a Hittite monopoly has come under scrutiny and is no longer a scholarly consensus .",

The Iron Age name of Samosata , Kummuh , probably gives its name to Commagene . Commagene has been characterized as a buffer state between Armenia , Parthia , Syria , and Rome ; culturally , it was correspondingly mixed . The kings of the Kingdom of Commagene claimed descent from Orontes with Darius I of Persia as their ancestor , by his marriage to Rhodogune , daughter of Artaxerxes II who had a family descent from king Darius I . The territory of Commagene corresponds roughly to the modern Turkish provinces of Ad\u0131yaman and northern Antep . Little is known of the region of Commagene prior to the beginning of the 2nd century BC . However , it seems that , from what little evidence remains , Commagene formed part of a larger state that also included the Kingdom of Sophene . This control lasted until c. 163 BC , when the local satrap , Ptolemaeus of Commagene , established himself as independent ruler following the death of the Seleucid king , Antiochus IV Epiphanes . The Kingdom of Commagene maintained its independence until 17 AD , when it was made a Roman province by Emperor Tiberius . It reemerged as an independent kingdom when Antiochus IV of Commagene was reinstated to the throne by order of Caligula , then deprived of it by that same emperor , then restored to it a couple of years later by his successor , Claudius . The re-emergent state lasted until 72 AD , when the Emperor Vespasian finally and definitively made it part of the Roman Empire .

During the Hellenistic period , it became the capital of the Kingdom of Pergamon under the Attalid dynasty in 281-133 BC , who transformed it into one of the major cultural centres of the Greek world . Many remains of its impressive monuments can still be seen and especially the outstanding masterpiece of the Pergamon Altar . Pergamon was the northernmost of the seven churches of Asia cited in the New Testament Book of Revelation . The city is centered around a 335-metre-high ( 1,099 ft ) mesa of andesite which formed its acropolis . This mesa falls away sharply on the north , west , and east sides , but three natural terraces on the south side provide a route up to the top .

He rose rapidly through the ranks to become first an officer and finally a Janissary commander , with the honorific title of a\u011fa . He refined his architectural and engineering skills while on campaign with the Janissaries , becoming expert at constructing fortifications of all kinds , as well as military infrastructure projects , such as roads , bridges and aqueducts .

  "/wiki/Ottoman_architecture": "Ottoman architecture is the architecture of the Ottoman Empire which emerged in Bursa and Edirne in 14th and 15th centuries . The architecture of the empire developed from the earlier Seljuk architecture and was influenced by the Byzantine architecture , Iranian as well as Islamic Mamluk traditions after the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans . For almost 400 years Byzantine architectural artifacts such as the church of Hagia Sophia served as models for many of the Ottoman mosques . Overall , Ottoman architecture has been described as Byzantine influenced architecture synthesized with architectural traditions of Central Asia and the Middle East . The Ottomans achieved the highest level architecture in their lands hence or since . They mastered the technique of building vast inner spaces confined by seemingly weightless yet massive domes , and achieving perfect harmony between inner and outer spaces , as well as articulated light and shadow . Islamic religious architecture which until then consisted of simple buildings with extensive decorations , was transformed by the Ottomans through a dynamic architectural vocabulary of vaults , domes , semi domes and columns . The mosque was transformed from being a cramped and dark chamber with arabesque-covered walls into a sanctuary of aesthetic and technical balance , refined elegance and a hint of heavenly transcendence . Today , one finds remnants of Ottoman architecture in certain parts of its former territories under decay .",

Known to history since the records of ancient Egypt and the Hittite Empire in the Late Bronze Age , it was populated by speakers of the Luwian language group . Written records began to be inscribed in stone in the Lycian language ( a later form of Luwian ) after Lycia 's involuntary incorporation into the Achaemenid Empire in the Iron Age . At that time ( 546 BC ) the Luwian speakers were decimated , and Lycia received an influx of Persian speakers . Ancient sources seem to indicate that an older name of the region was Alope ( Ancient Greek : \u1f08\u03bb\u03cc\u03c0\u03b7 , romanized : Al\u00f3p\u0113 ) . Lycia fought for the Persians in the Persian Wars , but on the defeat of the Achaemenid Empire by the Greeks , it became intermittently a free agent . After a brief membership in the Athenian Empire , it seceded and became independent ( its treaty with Athens had omitted the usual non-secession clause ) , was under the Persians again , revolted again , was conquered by Mausolus of Caria , returned to the Persians , and finally fell under Macedonian hegemony upon the defeat of the Persians by Alexander the Great . Due to the influx of Greek speakers and the sparsity of the remaining Lycian speakers , Lycia was rapidly Hellenized under the Macedonians , and the Lycian language disappeared from inscriptions and coinage . On defeating Antiochus III the Great in 188 BC , the Roman Republic gave Lycia to Rhodes for 20 years , taking it back in 168 BC . In these latter stages of the Roman Republic , Lycia came to enjoy freedom as a Roman protectorate . The Romans validated home rule officially under the Lycian League in 168 BC . This native government was an early federation with republican principles ; these later came to the attention of the framers of the United States Constitution , influencing their thoughts .",

The tomb is thought to have stood until the Byzantine era before falling into ruin . The ruins were rediscovered by British traveller Charles Fellows in the early 1840s . Fellows had them shipped to the British Museum , where some of them have been reconstructed to show what the east fa\u00e7ade of the monument would have looked like . According to Melanie Michailidis , though bearing a Greek appearance , the Nereid Monument , the Harpy Tomb and the Tomb of Payava were built according main Zoroastrian criteria by being composed of thick stone , raised on plinths off the ground , and having single windowless chambers .

The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius of Priene . Its elevated tomb structure is derived from the tombs of neighbouring Lycia , a territory Mausolus had invaded and annexed circa 360 BC , such as the Nereid Monument . The Mausoleum was approximately 45 m ( 148 ft ) in height , and the four sides were adorned with sculptural reliefs , each created by one of four Greek sculptors : Leochares , Bryaxis , Scopas of Paros , and Timotheus .

The Ionian and Dorian Greeks colonized the west of it and joined the Carian population in forming Greek-dominated states there .
