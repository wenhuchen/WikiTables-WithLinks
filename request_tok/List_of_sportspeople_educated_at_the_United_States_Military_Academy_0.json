  "/wiki/Abner_Doubleday": "Abner Doubleday ( June 26 , 1819 - January 26 , 1893 ) was a career United States Army officer and Union major general in the American Civil War . He fired the first shot in defense of Fort Sumter , the opening battle of the war , and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg . Gettysburg was his finest hour , but his relief by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade caused lasting enmity between the two men . In San Francisco , after the war , he obtained a patent on the cable car railway that still runs there . In his final years in New Jersey , he was a prominent member and later president of the Theosophical Society . In 1908 , fifteen years after his death , Doubleday was declared by the Mills Commission to have invented the game of baseball ( a claim never made by Doubleday during his lifetime ) . This claim has been thoroughly debunked by baseball historians .",
  "/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)": "In the United States Army , United States Marine Corps , and United States Air Force , major general is a two-star general officer rank , with the pay grade of O-8 . Major general ranks above brigadier general and below lieutenant general . [ Note 1 ] A major general typically commands division-sized units of 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers . Major general is equivalent to the two-star rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard , and is the highest permanent peacetime rank in the uniformed services . Higher ranks are technically temporary and linked to specific positions , although virtually all officers promoted to those ranks are approved to retire at their highest earned rank .",
  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",
  "/wiki/Origins_of_baseball": "The question of the origins of baseball has been the subject of debate and controversy for more than a century . Baseball and the other modern bat , ball , and running games , cricket and rounders , were developed from folk games in early Britain and Continental Europe ( such as France and Germany ) . Early forms of baseball had a number of names , including base ball , goal ball , round ball , fetch-catch , stool ball , and , simply , base . In at least one version of the game , teams pitched to themselves , runners went around the bases in the opposite direction of today 's game , and players could be put out by being hit with the ball . Just as now , in some versions a batter was called out after three strikes . Although much is unclear , as one would expect of children 's games of long ago , this much is known : by the mid-18th century a game had appeared in the south of England which involved striking a pitched ball and then running a circuit of bases . Base ball was at least one name for this proto-baseball , although there may have been others . English colonists took this game to America with their other pastimes , and in the early 1800s variants were being played on both sides of the ocean under many appellations . However , the game was very significantly altered by amateur men 's ball clubs in and around New York City in the middle of the 19th century , and it was this heavily revised sport that became modern baseball .",

  "/wiki/Spanish\u2013American_War": "The Spanish-American War ( Spanish : Guerra Hispano-Americana ; Filipino : Digmaang Espanyol-Amerikano ) was an armed conflict between Spain and the United States in 1898 . Hostilities began in the aftermath of the internal explosion of USS Maine in Havana Harbor in Cuba , leading to U.S. intervention in the Cuban War of Independence . The war led to emergence of U.S. predominance in the Caribbean region , and resulted in U.S. acquisition of Spain 's Pacific possessions . That led to U.S. involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately in the Philippine-American War . The main issue was Cuban independence . Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish rule . The U.S. later backed these revolts upon entering the Spanish-American War . There had been war scares before , as in the Virginius Affair in 1873 , but in the late 1890s , American public opinion was agitated by reports of gruesome Spanish atrocities . The business community had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains . It lobbied vigorously against going to war . President William McKinley ignored the exaggerated yellow press and sought a peaceful settlement . The United States Navy armored cruiser USS Maine mysteriously exploded and sank in Havana Harbor ; political pressures from the Democratic Party pushed McKinley into a war that he had wished to avoid .",
  "/wiki/Philippine\u2013American_War": "The Philippine-American War , also referred to as the Filipino-American War , the Philippine War , the Philippine Insurrection or the Tagalog Insurgency ( Filipino : Digmaang Pilipino-Amerikano ; Spanish : Guerra Filipino-Estadounidense ) , was an armed conflict between the First Philippine Republic and the United States that lasted from February 4 , 1899 , to July 2 , 1902 . While Filipino nationalists viewed the conflict as a continuation of the struggle for independence that began in 1896 with the Philippine Revolution , the U.S. government regarded it as an insurrection . The conflict arose when the First Philippine Republic objected to the terms of the Treaty of Paris under which the United States took possession of the Philippines from Spain , ending the Spanish-American War . Fighting erupted between forces of the United States and those of the Philippine Republic on February 4 , 1899 , in what became known as the 1899 Battle of Manila . On June 2 , 1899 , the First Philippine Republic officially declared war against the United States . The war officially ended on July 2 , 1902 , with a victory for the United States . However , some Philippine groups - led by veterans of the Katipunan , a Philippine revolutionary society - continued to battle the American forces for several more years . Among those leaders was General Macario Sakay , a veteran Katipunan member who assumed the presidency of the proclaimed Tagalog Republic , formed in 1902 after the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo . Other groups , including the Moro , Bicol , and Pulahan peoples , continued hostilities in remote areas and islands , until their final defeat at the Battle of Bud Bagsak on June 15 , 1913 . The war resulted in the deaths of at least 200,000 Filipino civilians , mostly due to famine and disease . Some estimates for total civilian dead reach up to a million . The war , and especially the following occupation by the U.S. , changed the culture of the islands , leading to the disestablishment of the Catholic Church in the Philippines as a state religion , and the introduction of English to the islands as the primary language of government , education , business , industry , and , in future decades , among upper-class families and educated individuals .",
  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",

This unit was reorganized at the start of the American Civil War as the 3rd U.S. Cavalry Regiment on 3 August 1861 . In January 1943 , the regiment was re-designated as the 3rd Cavalry Group ( Mechanized ) . Today they are equipped with Stryker vehicles .

  "/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Medal_(U.S._Army)": "The Distinguished Service Medal ( DSM ) is a military award of the United States Army that is presented to any person who , while serving in any capacity with the United States military , has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility . The performance must be such as to merit recognition for service that is clearly exceptional . Exceptional performance of normal duty will not alone justify an award of this decoration . Separate Distinguished Service Medals exist for the different branches of the military as well as a fifth version of the medal which is a senior award of the United States Department of Defense . The army version of the Distinguished Service Medal is typically referred to simply as the Distinguished Service Medal , while the other branches of service use the service name as a prefix . For service not related to actual war , the term duty of a great responsibility applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war , and requires evidence of conspicuously significant achievement . However , justification of the award may accrue by virtue of exceptionally meritorious service in a succession of high positions of great importance . Awards may be made to persons other than members of the United States Armed Forces for wartime services only , and then only under exceptional circumstances , with the express approval of the president in each case .",

It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements .

Despite successfully locating and defeating the main body of Villa 's command , responsible for the raid on Columbus , U.S. forces were unable to achieve Wilson 's stated main objective of preventing Villa 's escape . The active search for Villa ended after a month in the field when troops sent by Venustiano Carranza , the head of the Constitutionalist faction of the revolution and now the head of the Mexican government , resisted the U.S. incursion . The Constitutionalist forces used arms at the town of Parral to resist passage of a U.S. Army column . The U.S. mission was changed to prevent further attacks on it by Mexican troops and to plan for war in the eventuality it broke out .

It was the first and only offensive launched mainly by the United States Army in World War I , and the attack caught the Germans in the process of retreating . This meant that their artillery was out of place and the American attack , coming up against disorganized German forces , proved more successful than expected . The Saint-Mihiel attack established the stature of the U.S. Army in the eyes of the French and British forces , and again demonstrated the critical role of artillery during World War I and the difficulty of supplying such massive armies while they were on the move . The U.S. attack faltered as artillery and food supplies were left behind on the muddy roads .

The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) .

He became an instructor at the Air Corps Tactical School between 1928 and 1931 , the crucial period when the theory of strategic bombardment achieved ascendancy within the Air Corps as the most effective use of airpower . With eight colleagues at the ACTS , he was a member of the Bomber Mafia , whose influence led to adoption of the theory as the doctrine of daylight precision bombing during World War II . Olds was a persuasive , sometimes controversial figure in the unsuccessful campaign during the 1930s to promote air force independence , but the bombardment doctrine the clique championed ultimately became the foundation for separation from the Army . Olds was also an accomplished aviator and flight leader . As commander of the 2d Bombardment Group between 1937 and 1940 , he led the first operational unit of B-17 Flying Fortresses and put theory into practice by overseeing the development of standard operating procedures for the heavy bomber . Olds showcased the capabilities of the new weapon by leading several highly publicized goodwill flights to South America . Despite his advocacy for strategic bombing , during the United States ' participation in World War II Olds did not command bombers in the field . Instead his major contribution to the war effort was creation and organization of the Air Corps Ferrying Command , whose task was delivery of newly produced aircraft to all parts of the globe , and which eventually became the Air Transport Command and successors .

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel . After the first two months of war , South Korean Army ( ROKA ) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat .

These Games , which were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States , marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens - the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games . They were also the first since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics , under a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating , even-numbered years . More than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports , including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball , mountain biking , and softball , as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing and women 's football ( soccer ) . 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debut in Atlanta , including eleven former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations . The hosting United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals , and the most gold ( 44 ) and silver ( 32 ) medals out of all countries . The U.S. topped the medal count for the first time since 1984 , and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics . Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi - who became the first men 's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal , Donovan Bailey - who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men 's 100 meters , and Lilia Podkopayeva - who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics . The festivities were marred by violence on July 27 , when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park - a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games ' festivities , killing 1 and injuring 111 . In 2003 , Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related attacks on abortion centers and a gay bar , and was sentenced to life in prison . He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors .",

More than 800 marathons are held throughout the world each year , with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes , as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants .",
  "/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics": "The 2004 Summer Olympics ( Greek : \u0398\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af \u039f\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u0391\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 2004 , Therino\u00ed Olympiako\u00ed Ag\u00f3nes 2004 ) , officially known as the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad and commonly known as Athens 2004 , was a premier international multi-sport event held in Athens , Greece , from 13 to 29 August 2004 with the motto Welcome Home . The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete , some 600 more than expected , accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries . There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports . Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance . 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began . Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system . There have been arguments ( mostly in popular media ) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis , however , there is little or no evidence for such a correlation . The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success , with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world .",
