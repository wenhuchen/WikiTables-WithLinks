  "/wiki/Anglican": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",

  "/wiki/Rabbi": "A rabbi is a spiritual leader or religious teacher in Judaism . One becomes a rabbi by being ordained by another rabbi , following a course of study of Jewish texts such as the Talmud . The basic form of the rabbi developed in the Pharisaic and Talmudic era , when learned teachers assembled to codify Judaism 's written and oral laws . The title rabbi was first used in the first century CE . In more recent centuries , the duties of a rabbi became increasingly influenced by the duties of the Protestant Christian minister , hence the title pulpit rabbis , and in 19th-century Germany and the United States rabbinic activities including sermons , pastoral counseling , and representing the community to the outside , all increased in importance . Within the various Jewish denominations there are different requirements for rabbinic ordination , and differences in opinion regarding who is recognized as a rabbi . For example , Orthodox Judaism does not ordain women as rabbis . Non-Orthodox movements have chosen to do so for what they view as halakhic reasons ( Conservative Judaism ) as well as ethical reasons ( Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism ) .",

A liberal strand of Judaism , it is characterized by a lessened stress on ritual and personal observance , regarding Jewish Law as non-binding and the individual Jew as autonomous , and great openness to external influences and progressive values . The origins of Reform Judaism lie in 19th-century Germany , where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates . Since the 1970s , the movement has adopted a policy of inclusiveness and acceptance , inviting as many as possible to partake in its communities , rather than strict theoretical clarity . It is strongly identified with progressive political and social agendas , mainly under the traditional Jewish rubric Tikkun Olam , or Repairing of the World . Tikkun Olam is a central motto of Reform Judaism , and action for its sake is one of the main channels for adherents to express their affiliation . The movement 's greatest center today is in North America . The various regional branches sharing these beliefs , including the American Union for Reform Judaism ( URJ ) , the Movement for Reform Judaism ( MRJ ) and Liberal Judaism in Britain , and the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism , are all united within the international World Union for Progressive Judaism .
