  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",
  "/wiki/C_(programming_language)": "C ( /si\u02d0/ , as in the letter c ) is a general-purpose , procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming , lexical variable scope , and recursion , while a static type system prevents unintended operations . By design , C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language . Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers , from supercomputers to embedded systems . C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix . Later , it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system . During the 1980s , C gradually gained popularity . It has become one of the most widely used programming languages , with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems . C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 ( see ANSI C ) and by the International Organization for Standardization . C is an imperative procedural language . It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions , all with minimal runtime support . Despite its low-level capabilities , the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming . A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code .",

The language has expanded significantly over time , and modern C++ has object-oriented , generic , and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation . It is almost always implemented as a compiled language , and many vendors provide C++ compilers , including the Free Software Foundation , LLVM , Microsoft , Intel , Oracle , and IBM , so it is available on many platforms . C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded , resource-constrained software and large systems , with performance , efficiency , and flexibility of use as its design highlights . C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts , with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications , including desktop applications , video games , servers ( e.g . e-commerce , Web search , or SQL servers ) , and performance-critical applications ( e.g . telephone switches or space probes ) . C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 ( informally known as C++17 ) . The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 , which was then amended by the C++03 , C++11 and C++14 standards . The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library . Before the initial standardization in 1998 , C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language ; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization .

Logo is not an acronym : the name was coined by Feurzeig while he was at Bolt , Beranek and Newman , and derives from the Greek logos , meaning word or thought . A general-purpose language , Logo is widely known for its use of turtle graphics , in which commands for movement and drawing produced line or vector graphics , either on screen or with a small robot termed a turtle . The language was conceived to teach concepts of programming related to Lisp and only later to enable what Papert called body-syntonic reasoning , where students could understand , predict , and reason about the turtle 's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle . There are substantial differences among the many dialects of Logo , and the situation is confused by the regular appearance of turtle graphics programs that are named Logo . Logo is a multi-paradigm adaptation and dialect of Lisp , a functional programming language . There is no standard Logo , but UCBLogo has the best facilities for handling lists , files , I/O , and recursion in scripts , and can be used to teach all computer science concepts , as UC Berkeley lecturer Brian Harvey did in his Computer Science Logo Style trilogy .

C++03 replaced the prior revision of the C++ standard , called C++98 , and was later replaced by C++11 . C++03 was primarily a bug fix release for the implementers to ensure greater consistency and portability . This revision addressed 92 core language defect reports , 125 library defect reports , and included only one new language feature : value initialization Among the more noteworthy defect reports addressed by C++03 was the library defect report 69 , whose resolution added the requirement that elements in a vector are stored contiguously . This codifies the common expectation that a C++ std : :vector object uses a memory layout similar to an array . While most implementations satisfied this expectation , it was not required by C++98 .",
  "/wiki/Squirrel_(programming_language)": "Squirrel is a high level imperative , object-oriented programming language , designed to be a lightweight scripting language that fits in the size , memory bandwidth , and real-time requirements of applications like video games and hardware such as Electric Imp . MirthKit , a simple toolkit for making and distributing open source , cross-platform 2D games , uses Squirrel for its platform . It is used extensively by Code : :Blocks for scripting and was also used in Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a King . It is also used in Left 4 Dead 2 , Portal 2 and Thimbleweed Park for scripted events and in NewDark , an unofficial Thief 2 : The Metal Age engine update , to facilitate additional , simplified means of scripting mission events , aside of the regular C scripting .",
  "/wiki/Boo_(programming_language)": "Boo is an object-oriented , statically typed , general-purpose programming language that seeks to make use of the Common Language Infrastructure 's support for Unicode , internationalization , and web applications , while using a Python-inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility . Some features of note include type inference , generators , multimethods , optional duck typing , macros , true closures , currying , and first-class functions . Boo was one of the three scripting languages for the Unity game engine ( Unity Technologies employed De Oliveira ) , until it was dropped in 2014 due to the small userbase . Despite official support for Boo ending , the language could still be used in Unity , until the Boo compiler was removed from the engine in 2017 . Boo is free software released under the BSD 3-Clause license . It is compatible with the Microsoft .NET and Mono frameworks .",
  "/wiki/Subtext_(programming_language)": "Subtext is a moderately visual programming language and environment , for writing application software . It is an experimental , research attempt to develop a new programming model , called Example Centric Programming , by treating copied blocks as first class prototypes , for program structure . It uses live text , similar to what occurs in spreadsheets as users update cells , for frequent feedback . It is intended to eventually be developed enough to become a practical language for daily use . It is planned to be open software ; the license is not yet determined . Subtext was created by Jonathan Edwards who submitted a paper on the language to OOPSLA . It was accepted as part of the 2005 conference ."
