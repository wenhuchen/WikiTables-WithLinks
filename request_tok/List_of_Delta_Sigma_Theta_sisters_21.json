As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

  "/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States": "The vice president of the United States is the second-highest officer in the executive branch of the U.S. federal government , after the president of the United States , and ranks first in the presidential line of succession . The vice president is also an officer in the legislative branch , as president of the Senate . In this capacity , the vice president is empowered to preside over Senate deliberations , but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote . The vice president also presides over joint sessions of Congress . The vice president is indirectly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College . Section 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment , ratified in 1967 , created a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession , establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress . Prior to 1967 , in the event a vice president succeeded to the presidency , died , or resigned from office , the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began . The vice president is also a statutory member of the National Security Council , and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution . The Office of the Vice President assists and organises the vice president 's official functions . The role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 constitutional Convention . Especially over the past 100 years , the vice presidency has evolved into a position of domestic and foreign policy political power , and is now widely seen as an integral part of a president 's administration . As the vice president 's role within the executive branch has expanded , his role within the legislative branch has contracted ; for example , he presides over the Senate only infrequently .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Citizens_Party": "The Citizens Party was a political party in the United States . It was founded in Washington , D.C. by Barry Commoner , who wanted to gather under one banner once-again a nationwide political organization of all the progressive , environmentalist and liberal groups , many of which were unsatisfied with President Carter 's administration , for the first time since the dissolution of the national Progressive Party in the 1960s . The Citizens Party registered with the Federal Elections Commission at the end of 1979 . Commoner , a professor of environmental science at Washington University in St. Louis , was the head of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems in St. Louis and editor of Science Illustrated magazine . The Citizens Party platform was very progressive , pro-science , and environmentalist in nature . Some have claimed that it was possibly socialist as well , but this claim arose from a misunderstanding of the economic democracy platform of the party , which appears to be a form of corporatism . Commoner clearly stated repeatedly that socialism for parts of the economy other than essential infrastructure was a disastrous idea . His economic democracy idea stated that the business of business is to do business , but that the business of government is to regulate business to prevent abuses . In all , the party was founded around four essential platforms , including economic democracy ."
