  "/wiki/N\u00e4tschen": "N\u00e4tschen is a mountain location and ski area above Andermatt , in the Canton of Uri , Switzerland . Higher up on N\u00e4tschen the mountain is known as G\u00fctsch . Its highest point is 2,344 m ( 7,690 ft ) . It is one of the mountains in the Gotthard Oberalp Arena , as is Gemsstock , which is on the other side of Andermatt . It has 11 ski runs , totaling approximately 21 km of ski pistes , and 4 ski lifts , including a Detachable 4-man Chairlift . N\u00e4tschen 's lifts are powered by 3 wind turbines , two of which were installed in late 2010 ( E-44 ) , the other in 2004 ( E-40 ) . These turbines are all made by Enercon . N\u00e4tschen has a railway station , run by the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn , which is between Andermatt and Disentis/Must\u00e9r .",
  "/wiki/Gondola_lift": "A gondola lift ( coming from Italian Language ) is a means of cable transport and type of aerial lift which is supported and propelled by cables from above . It consists of a loop of steel cable that is strung between two stations , sometimes over intermediate supporting towers . The cable is driven by a bullwheel in a terminal , which is typically connected to an engine or electric motor . They are often considered continuous systems since they feature a haul rope which continuously moves and circulates around two terminal stations . Depending on the combination of cables used for support and/or haulage and the type of grip ( detachable grip vs. fixed grip ) , the capacity , cost , and functionality of a gondola lift will differ dramatically . Because of the proliferation of such systems in the Alpine regions of Europe , the Italian language name of Teleferica Telecabina Funicolare ( Neapolitan Language ) or the French language name of T\u00e9l\u00e9cabine are also used in an English language and many others context .",
  "/wiki/Detachable_chairlift": "A detachable chairlift or high-speed chairlift is a type of passenger aerial lift , which , like a fixed-grip chairlift , consists of numerous chairs attached to a constantly moving wire rope ( called a haul rope ) that is strung between two ( or more ) terminals over intermediate towers . They are now commonplace at all but the smallest of ski resorts . Some are installed at tourist attractions as well as for urban transportation . The significance of detachable chairlift technology is primarily the speed and capacity . Detachable chairlifts move far faster than their fixed-grip brethren , averaging 1,000 feet per minute ( 11.3 mph , 18 km/h , 5.08 m/s ) versus a typical fixed-grip speed of 500 ft/min ( 5.6 mph , 9 km/h , 2.54 m/s ) . Because the cable moves faster than most passengers could safely disembark and load , each chair is connected to the cable by a powerful spring-loaded cable grip which detaches at terminals , allowing the chair to slow considerably for convenient loading and unloading at a typical speed of 200 ft/min ( 2 mph , 4 km/h , 1 m/s ) , a speed slower even than fixed-grip bunny chairlifts . Another advantage of detaching chairs is the ability to remove chairs during severe weather in order to reduce stress on the rope and towers . Furthermore , operating the unladen rope during extreme weather is effective at preventing - or greatly reducing - ice and snow accumulation on the sheaves and rope . This saves considerable time , expense and hazard when opening the chair for operation , which would otherwise require workers to climb each tower and chip away ice and shovel snow . Chairlifts are made in a variety of sizes , carrying from 1 to 8 passengers . All chairs on a given chairlift usually have the same capacity . Slang terms for the different sizes include single , double , triple , quad , six pack , and eight .",

  "/wiki/Oberalp": "Oberalp Pass ( Romansh : Alpsu or Cuolm d'Ursera , German : Oberalppass ) ( el . 2044 m. ) is a high mountain pass in the Swiss Alps connecting the cantons of Graub\u00fcnden and Uri between Disentis and Andermatt .",
  "/wiki/Chairlift": "An elevated passenger ropeway , or chairlift , is a type of aerial lift , which consists of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers , carrying a series of chairs . They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas ( in such cases referred to as 'skilifts ' ) , but are also found at amusement parks , various tourist attractions , and increasingly in urban transport . Depending on carrier size and loading efficiency , a passenger ropeway can move up to 4000 people per hour , and the fastest lifts achieve operating speeds of up to 12 m/s ( 39.4 ft/s ) or 43.2 km/h ( 26.8 mph ) . The two-person double chair , which for many years was the workhorse of the ski industry , can move roughly 1200 people per hour at rope speeds of up to 2.5 m/s ( 8.2 ft/s ) . The four person detachable chairlift ( high-speed quad ) can transport 2400 people per hour with an average rope speed of 5 m/s ( 16.4 ft/s ) . Some bi and tri cable elevated ropeways and reversible tramways achieve much greater operating speeds .",
  "/wiki/T-bar": "A surface lift is a means of cable transport for snow sports in which skiers and snowboarders remain on the ground as they are pulled uphill . Once prevalent , they have been overtaken in popularity by higher-capacity and higher-comfort aerial lifts , such as chairlifts and gondola lifts . Today , surface lifts are most often found on beginner slopes , small ski areas , and peripheral slopes . They are also often utilized to access glacier ski slopes because their supports can be anchored in glacier ice due to the lower forces and realigned due to glacier movement . Surface lifts have some disadvantages compared to aerial lifts : they require more passenger skill and may be difficult for some beginners and children ; sometimes they lack a suitable route back to the piste ; the snow surface must be continuous ; they can get in the way of skiable terrain ; they are relatively slow in speed and have lower capacity . Surface lifts have some advantages over aerial lifts : they can be exited before the lift reaches the top , they can often continue operating in wind conditions too strong for a chairlift ; they require less maintenance and are much less expensive to install and operate .",
  "/wiki/Gemsstock": "Gemsstock is a mountain of the Swiss Lepontine Alps , overlooking Andermatt in the canton of Uri . A glacier named Gurschenfirn lies over its northern flanks . The Gemsstock is a subpeak of the higher Chastelhorn , lying approximately one kilometre south-west .",
  "/wiki/Aerial_tramway": "An aerial tramway , sky tram , cable car , ropeway or aerial tram is a type of aerial lift which uses one or two stationary ropes for support while a third moving rope provides propulsion . [ failed verification ] With this form of lift , the grip of an aerial tramway cabin is fixed onto the propulsion rope and can not be decoupled from it during operations . In comparison to gondola lifts , aerial tramways provide lower line capacities and higher wait times and are unable to turn corners .",
