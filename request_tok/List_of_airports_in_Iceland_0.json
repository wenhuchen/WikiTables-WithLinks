The village prospered in the 19th century thanks to sound business enterprise and the booming fishing industry . \u00d3lafur Thorlacius ( 1761-1815 ) set up business in B\u00edldudalur following the end of the Danish trade monopoly . He was one of the most influential businessmen in Iceland at the beginning of the 19th century . He bought and sold fish , traded goods and ran his own small fishing fleet . One of his successors , P\u00e9tur J. Thorsteinnsson ( 1854-1924 ) successfully continued this operation . In the late 20th and early 21st centuries , the decline of the fishing industry and the imposition of strict quotas by the Icelandic government led the town to diversify its economy . The village is now home to a factory , which provides employment to many residents , processing a mineral-rich algae found in abundance in the fjord . The village is also becoming a popular tourist destination , especially for fishing trips and for artists seeking to gain inspiration from the spectacular scenery .
