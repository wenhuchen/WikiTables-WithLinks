It constitutes both a county and a municipality . During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken , the northernmost Danish province . Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the name \u00c1nslo , and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada . The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300 . Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence . After being destroyed by a fire in 1624 , during the reign of King Christian IV , a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king 's honour . It was established as a municipality ( formannskapsdistrikt ) on 1 January 1838 . The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814-1905 union between Sweden and Norway . From 1877 , the city 's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage , a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897 . In 1925 the city , after incorporating the village retaining its former name , was renamed Oslo . In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker , a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger , thus creating the modern , vastly enlarged Oslo municipality .",

The municipality is the fourth most populous in Norway . Located on the Stavanger Peninsula in Southwest Norway , Stavanger counts its official founding year as 1125 , the year the Stavanger Cathedral was completed . Stavanger 's core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city 's cultural heritage . This has caused the town centre and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses , and has contributed significantly to spreading the city 's population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger . The city 's rapid population growth in the late 20th century was primarily a result of Norway 's booming offshore oil industry . Today the oil industry is a key industry in the Stavanger region and the city is widely referred to as the Oil Capital of Norway .
