At various points in his life , Russell considered himself a liberal , a socialist and a pacifist , although he also confessed that his sceptical nature had led him to feel that he had never been any of these things , in any profound sense . Russell was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom . In the early 20th century , Russell led the British revolt against idealism . He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege , colleague G. E. Moore and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ludwig Wittgenstein . He is widely held to be one of the 20th century 's premier logicians . With A. N. Whitehead he wrote Principia Mathematica , an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics , the quintessential work of classical logic . His philosophical essay On Denoting has been considered a paradigm of philosophy . His work has had a considerable influence on mathematics , logic , set theory , linguistics , artificial intelligence , cognitive science , computer science ( see type theory and type system ) and philosophy , especially the philosophy of language , epistemology and metaphysics . Russell was a prominent anti-war activist and he championed anti-imperialism . Occasionally , he advocated preventive nuclear war , before the opportunity provided by the atomic monopoly had passed and he decided he would welcome with enthusiasm world government . He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I .",

The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world .

He was shortlisted , in 1966 and 1967 , for the Nobel Prize for Literature . Through 67 years of writings , which included over 25 novels , he explored the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world , often through a Catholic perspective . Although Greene objected strongly to being described as a Roman Catholic novelist , rather than as a novelist who happened to be Catholic , Catholic religious themes are at the root of much of his writing , especially the four major Catholic novels : Brighton Rock , The Power and the Glory , The Heart of the Matter , and The End of the Affair ; which have been named the gold standard of the Catholic novel . Several works , such as The Confidential Agent , The Quiet American , Our Man in Havana , The Human Factor , and his screenplay for The Third Man , also show Greene 's avid interest in the workings and intrigues of international politics and espionage . Greene was born in Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire into a large , influential family that included the owners of the Greene King Brewery . He boarded at Berkhamsted School in Hertfordshire , where his father taught and became headmaster . Unhappy at the school , he attempted suicide several times .

From 1939 to 1945 , following its forced division and partial incorporation into Nazi Germany , the state did not de facto exist but its government-in-exile continued to operate . From 1948 to 1990 , Czechoslovakia was part of the Eastern Bloc with a command economy . Its economic status was formalized in membership of Comecon from 1949 and its defense status in the Warsaw Pact of May 1955 . A period of political liberalization in 1968 , known as the Prague Spring , was forcibly ended when the Soviet Union , assisted by several other Warsaw Pact countries , invaded Czechoslovakia . In 1989 , as Marxist-Leninist governments and socialism were ending all over Europe , Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their government in the Velvet Revolution ; state price controls were removed after a period of preparation . In 1993 , Czechoslovakia split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia .",

It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho . South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .

Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America 's most significant novelists and essayists , and one of the leading writers of his generation . Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom . In 2010 he won the Nobel Prize in Literature , for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual 's resistance , revolt , and defeat . Vargas Llosa rose to international fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero ( La ciudad y los perros , literally The City and the Dogs , 1963/1966 ) , The Green House ( La casa verde , 1965/1968 ) , and the monumental Conversation in the Cathedral ( Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral , 1969/1975 ) .

Several , such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service ( 1973/1978 ) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter ( 1977/1982 ) , have been adapted as feature films . Many of Vargas Llosa 's works are influenced by the writer 's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian . Increasingly , however , he has expanded his range , and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world . In his essays , Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world . Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism , to a sometimes playful postmodernism .",

Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent .
