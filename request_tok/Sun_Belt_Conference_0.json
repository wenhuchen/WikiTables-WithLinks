Troy University is regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges ( SACS ) to award associate , baccalaureate , master 's , education specialist , and doctoral degrees . In August 2005 , Troy State University , Montgomery ; Troy State University , Phenix City ; Troy State University , Dothan ; and Troy State University ( Main Campus ) all merged under one accreditation to become Troy University to better reflect the institution 's worldwide mission . Prior to the merger , each campus was independently accredited and merging of these campuses helped to create a stronger institution by eliminating overlapping services and barriers to students . The merger combined staff , faculty , and administrators into a single university . Today , the university serves the educational needs of students in four Alabama campuses and 60 teaching sites in 17 U.S. States and 11 countries . Troy University has over 100,000 alumni in 50 states of the US and in other countries .",

  "/wiki/Troy_Trojans": "The Troy Trojans are the sports teams of Troy University . They began playing in the NCAA 's Division I-A in 2001 , became a football only member of the Sun Belt Conference in 2004 , and joined that conference for all other sports in 2005 . Troy University 's athletics nickname was the Red Wave until the early 1970s when the student body voted to change the name to Trojans . Prior to becoming a member of NCAA Division One athletics in 1993 , Troy University was a member of the Gulf South Conference of the NCAA Division II ranks . At the time , Troy 's primary rivals were Jacksonville State University , Livingston University ( now the University of West Alabama ) , and the University of North Alabama . The rivalry between Troy and Jacksonville State was arguably the fiercest of those . However , since Troy University moved to Division I-A participation in football and because Troy and JSU no longer share the same conference affiliation , this once heated rivalry has cooled significantly . Troy has Sun Belt rivalries with all East Division schools ( Appalachian State , Coastal Carolina , Georgia Southern , Georgia State , and South Alabama ) . Currently , the Trojans ' most prominent rival in all sports is their main Sun Belt rival , South Alabama ."
