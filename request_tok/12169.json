The Cardinals were founded as the Morgan Athletic Club in 1898 , and are the oldest continuously run professional football team in the United States . The Cardinals play their home games at State Farm Stadium , which opened in 2006 and is located in the northwestern suburb of Glendale . The team was established in Chicago in 1898 as an amateur football team and joined the NFL as a charter member on September 17 , 1920 . Along with the Chicago Bears , the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in operation since the league 's founding ( the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL a year after its creation in 1921 ) . The club then moved to St. Louis in 1960 and played in that city through 1987 ( sometimes referred to as the Football Cardinals or the Big Red to avoid confusion with the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball ) . Before the 1988 season , the team moved west to Tempe , Arizona , a college suburb east of Phoenix , and played their home games for the next 18 seasons at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University . In 2006 , the club moved to their current home field in Glendale , although the team 's executive offices and training facility remain in Tempe . The franchise has won two NFL championships , both while it was based in Chicago . The first occurred in 1925 , but is the subject of controversy , with supporters of the Pottsville Maroons believing that Pottsville should have won the title . Their second title , and the first to be won in a championship game , came in 1947 , nearly two decades before the first Super Bowl .",
