  "/wiki/St._George's_Methodist_Church": "St. George 's United Methodist Church , located at the corner of 4th and New Streets , in the Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia , is the oldest Methodist church in continuous use in the United States , beginning in 1769 . The congregation was founded in 1767 , meeting initially in a sail loft on Dock Street , and in 1769 it purchased the shell of a building which had been erected in 1763 by a German Reformed congregation . At this time , Methodists had not yet broken away from the Anglican Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church was not founded until 1784 . Richard Allen and Absalom Jones became the first African Americans licensed by the Methodist Church . They were licensed by St. George 's Church in 1784 . Three years later , protesting racial segregation in the worship services , Allen led most of the black members out of St. George 's ; eventually they founded the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church and the African Methodist Episcopal denomination . Absalom Jones became an Episcopal priest . In the 1920s a court case saved the church from being demolished to make way for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge . The case resulted in the bridge being relocated . St. George 's has experienced many changes during its 249-year history . From 100 members in 1769 , the church grew to a peak membership of 3,200 congregants in 1835 . The Civil War and industrialization changed the neighborhood ; the congregation was reduced to 25 by 1900 .",
