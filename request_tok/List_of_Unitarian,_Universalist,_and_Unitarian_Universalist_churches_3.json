The Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems drain their respective valleys and meet to form the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta , a large expanse of interconnected canals , stream beds , sloughs , marshes , and peat islands . The delta empties into the San Francisco Bay , and then ultimately flows into the Pacific . The waters of the Tulare Basin essentially never flow to the ocean ( with the exception of Kings River waters diverted northward for irrigation ) , though they are connected by man-made canals to the San Joaquin and could drain there again naturally if they were ever to rise high enough .",

It is the last period of the Paleozoic era ; the following Triassic period belongs to the Mesozoic era . The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison , who named it after the region of Perm in Russia . The Permian witnessed the diversification of the early amniotes into the ancestral groups of the mammals , turtles , lepidosaurs , and archosaurs . The world at the time was dominated by two continents known as Pangaea and Siberia , surrounded by a global ocean called Panthalassa . The Carboniferous rainforest collapse left behind vast regions of desert within the continental interior . Amniotes , which could better cope with these drier conditions , rose to dominance in place of their amphibian ancestors . The Permian ( along with the Paleozoic ) ended with the Permian-Triassic extinction event , the largest mass extinction in Earth 's history , in which nearly 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species died out .
