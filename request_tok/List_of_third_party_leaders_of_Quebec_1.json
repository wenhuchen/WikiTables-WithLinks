In 1899 , Bourassa was outspoken against the British government 's request for Canada to send a militia to fight for Britain in the Second Boer War . Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier 's compromise was to send a volunteer force , but the seeds were sown for future conscription protests during the World Wars of the next half-century . Bourassa challenged , unsuccessfully , the proposal to build warships to help protect the empire . He led the opposition to mandatory conscription during World War I , arguing that Canada 's interests were not at stake .

The Union Nationale , led by former premier Maurice Duplessis , defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party , led by Ad\u00e9lard Godbout . This was the first Quebec provincial election in which women were allowed to vote , having been granted suffrage at the provincial level in 1940 and at the federal level in 1919 . This election marked Duplessis 's comeback after having defeated Godbout in the 1936 election and having lost to him in the 1939 election . Unlike in the 1939 election , when the alcoholic Duplessis was clearly drunk at numerous campaign rallies , le chef had benefited from the time he had spent in an American sanatorium in 1942-43 , where he had sobered up , and in the 1944 election , Duplessis refrained from drinking . The biggest issue during this election was provincial autonomy . In order to appeal to nationalist voters , Duplessis attacked the incumbent premier , claiming that he was not taking a strong enough stand against Ottawa . He mainly criticized Godbout for agreeing to transfer unemployment insurance from the province to the federal government . He also criticized the Rowell-Sirois Commission for its stance on unemployment insurance and equalization payments . Another reason Duplessis won the election was by appealing to anti-Semitic prejudices in Quebec by making the false claim in a violently anti-Semitic speech that the Dominion government together with the Godbout government had made a secret deal with the International Zionist Brotherhood to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees left homeless by the Holocaust in Quebec after the war in exchange for Jewish campaign contributions to both the federal and provincial Liberal parties . By contrast , Duplessis claimed that he was not taking any money from the Jews , and if he were elected Premier , he would stop this plan to bring Jewish refugees to Quebec . To further push on the message , the Union Nationale handed out campaign pamphlets warning about the alleged plan to bring 100,000 Jewish refugees to Quebec , which featured a cartoon of the standard stereotype of an evil-looking , hook-nosed Jew handing bags of money to Godbout while in the background a vast horde of dirty , disreputable-looking , hook-nosed Jewish refugees were ready to descend on la belle province .",

The territory has seen human occupation since the Pleistocene by First Nations until European colonisation started near the end of the 17th century with the concession of tenures , despite this , the development of the region was slow until it started exploiting its mixed forests , allowing it to grow and settle further inland , on the littoral and to develop a leisure industry . Its geography is marked by the Saint Lawrence River to the northwest , the Notre Dame Mountains section of the Appalachians , as well as the Matap\u00e9dia and T\u00e9miscouata valleys , which forms the natural communication corridors with the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula , Maine , and the Maritimes .",
  "/wiki/1994_Quebec_general_election": "The 1994 Quebec general election was held on September 12 , 1994 , to elect members of the National Assembly of Quebec , Canada . The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois , led by Jacques Parizeau , defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party , led by Premier Daniel Johnson Jr. Johnson had succeeded Robert Bourassa as Liberal leader and Premier . Both his father , Daniel Sr. , and brother , Pierre-Marc , had previously served as premiers of Quebec as leaders of different parties . This election was very significant for Quebec history , because it set the stage for the 1995 Quebec referendum on independence for Quebec from Canada . In this referendum , the PQ 's proposals for sovereignty were very narrowly defeated . Mario Dumont , a former president of the Liberal party 's youth wing , and then leader of the newly formed Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec , won his own seat , but no other members of his party were elected . In Saint-Jean there was a tie between incumbent Liberal candidate Michel Charbonneau and PQ candidate Roger Paquin .

  "/wiki/2007_Quebec_general_election": "The 2007 Quebec general election was held in the Canadian province of Quebec on March 26 , 2007 to elect members of the 38th National Assembly of Quebec . The Quebec Liberal Party led by Premier Jean Charest managed to win a plurality of seats , but were reduced to a minority government , Quebec 's first in 129 years , since the 1878 general election .

The Liberals won their lowest share of the popular vote since Confederation , and the PQ with their 28.35% of the votes cast won their lowest share since 1973 and their second lowest ever ( ahead of only the 23.06% attained in their initial election campaign in 1970 ) . Each of the three major parties won nearly one-third of the popular vote , the closest three-way split in Quebec electoral history until the 2012 election . Voter turnout among those eligible was 71.23% , a marginal difference from the previous general election in 2003 .

  "/wiki/Action_d\u00e9mocratique_du_Qu\u00e9bec": "The Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec ( Democratic Action of Quebec ) , commonly referred to as the ADQ was a right-wing populist and conservative provincial political party in Quebec , Canada . On the sovereignty question , it defined itself as autonomist , and had support from nationalists and federalists . Its members were referred to as ad\u00e9quistes , a name derived from the French pronunciation of the initials 'ADQ ' . The party was founded by dissidents of the Quebec Liberal Party who did not accept the Charlottetown Accord , and first contested the 1994 provincial election , electing Mario Dumont to the National Assembly . Under longtime leader Dumont , the ADQ had a strong showing in the 2007 provincial election , reducing the ruling Quebec Liberal Party ( PLQ ) to a minority government and relegating the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ( PQ ) to third place . The ADQ won 41 seats with 31% of the popular vote to serve as the Official Opposition in the National Assembly . However , the ADQ 's popularity declined significantly soon afterward and in the 2008 provincial elections , the party failed to secure at least twenty percent of the popular vote or twelve Members of the National Assembly ( MNAs ) in the last election , and consequently lost official party status , though in early 2009 it was recognised as an official party by the PLQ and the PQ . On 21 January 2012 , the membership approved a merger with the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec . The merger was recognised by the Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9lections du Qu\u00e9bec on 14 February 2012 .",

On December 8 , 2008 , Khadir became the first , and at that time , only elected representative for Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire in the general election in Quebec . In 2012 , Fran\u00e7oise David was elected in Gouin , making her the second elected representative for Qu\u00e9bec solidaire . Khadir served alongside David as Quebec solidaire 's spokespersons and de facto leaders from the party 's founding until November 2012 , when he stepped down to allow the party to choose a new male co-spokesperson from outside the legislature in accordance with party statutes . It 's the logical next step . First , for a party that considers itself feminist , it would be fairly contradictory to finally have a female deputy of Fran\u00e7oise 's quality in the National Assembly and not have her be the spokesperson , Khadir said .",
