  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers , letters or symbols . [ note 1 ] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position ; alternatively , a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector . A common choice of coordinates is latitude , longitude and elevation . To specify a location on a plane requires a map projection .",
  "/wiki/Heavy_fuel_oil": "Heavy Fuel Oil ( HFO ) is a category of fuel oils of a tar-like consistency identified as a worse case substance . Also known as bunker fuel or residual fuel oil , HFO is the result or remnant from the distillation and cracking process of crude oil . For this reason , HFO is contaminated with several different compounds including aromatics , sulfur and nitrogen , making emission upon combustion more polluting compared to other fuel oils . HFO is predominantly used as a fuel source for marine vessel propulsion due to its relatively low cost compared to cleaner fuel sources such as distillates . The use and carriage of HFO on-board vessels presents several environmental concerns namely : the risk of oil spill and the emission of toxic compounds and particulates including black carbon . Presently , the use of HFOs is banned as a fuel source for ships travelling in the Antarctic as part of the International Maritime Organization 's ( IMO ) International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters ( Polar Code ) . For similar reasons , an HFO ban in Arctic waters is currently underway as IMO committed to the prohibition of the use or carriage of HFO within the next several years .",

This power station is one of about a dozen heavy fuel-fired power stations which offer the country backup capacity as standby plants that come on-line quickly , if and when geothermal and weather-dependent hydro-power fail to provide adequate supply to the national grid .",
  "/wiki/Lamu_Coal_Power_Station": "The proposed Lamu Coal Power Station is a potential 1,050 MW ( 1,410,000 hp ) coal-fired thermal power station in Kenya . The proposed plant would be developed on 865 acres of land and feature a 210 meter tall smoke stack , which would become East Africa 's tallest structure . It would have been the first ever coal power plant in Kenya . Kenya national government and media have been largely positive about the economic benefits from the coal plant activity . However , community advocates and some local government officials expressed concern over whether the benefits would be well distributed , whether the jobs would really materialise , and the lack of discussion over possible negative effects from the project . As of June 2017 , recent coverage has centred on the lack of economic viability and need for the proposed Lamu coal plant , citing a range of experts in news and analysis pieces . International accountability organisations also raised concerns in a series of global blog posts . The project was halted on 26 June , 2019 .",

  "/wiki/Biogas": "Biogas is the mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen ( anaerobically ) , primarily consisting of methane and carbon dioxide . Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste , manure , municipal waste , plant material , sewage , green waste or food waste . Biogas is a renewable energy source . In India , it is also known as Gobar Gas . Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with methanogen or anaerobic organisms , which digest material inside a closed system , or fermentation of biodegradable materials . This closed system is called an anaerobic digester , biodigester or a bioreactor . Biogas is primarily methane ( CH4 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , moisture and siloxanes . The gases methane , hydrogen , and carbon monoxide ( CO ) can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen . This energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel ; it can be used for any heating purpose , such as cooking . It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat . Biogas can be compressed , the same way as natural gas is compressed to CNG , and used to power motor vehicles . In the United Kingdom , for example , biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around 17% of vehicle fuel .",

  "/wiki/Natural_gas": "Natural gas ( also called fossil gas ) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes , and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide , or helium . It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years . The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change ; it itself is a greenhouse gas , and it releases carbon dioxide when burned . However , natural gas use often supplants coal use , which is far more environmentally damaging , leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas . Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic . Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments . Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material ."
