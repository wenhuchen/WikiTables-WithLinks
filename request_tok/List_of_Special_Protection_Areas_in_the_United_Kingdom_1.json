Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language , although in a few areas English speakers form a majority . Most of the islands have a bedrock formed from ancient metamorphic rocks and the climate is mild and oceanic . The 15 inhabited islands have a total population of 26,830 and there are more than 50 substantial uninhabited islands . From Barra Head to the Butt of Lewis is roughly 210 kilometres ( 130 mi ) . There are various important prehistoric structures , many of which pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors . The Western Isles became part of the Norse kingdom of the Su\u00f0reyjar , which lasted for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266 . Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs , principal of whom were the MacLeods , MacDonalds , Mackenzies and MacNeils . The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline .

Arran has been continuously inhabited since the early Neolithic period . Numerous prehistoric remains have been found . From the 6th century onwards , Goidelic-speaking peoples from Ireland colonised it and it became a centre of religious activity . In the troubled Viking Age , Arran became the property of the Norwegian crown , until formally absorbed by the kingdom of Scotland in the 13th century . The 19th-century clearances led to significant depopulation and the end of the Gaelic language and way of life .

Assynt is known for its landscape and its remarkable mountains , which have led to the area , along with neighbouring Coigach , being designated as the Assynt-Coigach National Scenic Area , one of 40 such areas in Scotland . The western part of Assynt has many distinctively shaped mountains , including Quinag , Canisp , Suilven and Ben More Assynt , that rise steeply from the surrounding cnoc and lochan scenery . These can often appear higher than their actual height would indicate due to their steep sides and the contrast with the moorland from which they rise . Many of the most distinctive peaks such as Suilven were formed during the last Ice Age , when they were left exposed above the ice sheet as nunataks , and they now remain as inselbergs of highly eroded Torridonian sandstone sitting on a bedrock of much older Lewisian gneiss . The Moine Thrust runs through the area , and is most visible at Knockan Crag National Nature Reserve , which includes a visitor centre interpreting the geological features of the landscape . In the east of Assynt lies a region of limestone scenery surrounding Ben More Assynt . This part of Assynt hosts the longest cave in Scotland , Uamh an Claonaite , which lies 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) south of Inchnadamph . The geological importance of Assynt is reflected in its inclusion in the North West Highlands Geopark . The name Assynt may derive from an Old Norse word meaning 'ridge end ' . There is also a tradition that the name comes from a fight between the two brothers Unt and Ass-Unt , ( meaning Man of Peace and Man of Discord ) . The latter having won the tussle gave his name to the parish .",
