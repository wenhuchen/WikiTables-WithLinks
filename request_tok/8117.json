  "/wiki/Cuba": "Cuba ( /\u02c8kju\u02d0b\u0259/ ( listen ) ; Spanish pronunciation : [ \u02c8ku\u03b2a ] ) , officially the Republic of Cuba ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica de Cuba ( help\u00b7info ) ) , is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos . Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . Havana is the largest city and capital ; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey . The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

  "/wiki/Havana": "Havana ( /h\u0259\u02c8v\u00e6n\u0259/ ; Spanish : La Habana [ la a\u02c8\u03b2ana ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city , largest city , province , major port , and leading commercial center of Cuba . The city has a population of 2.1 million inhabitants , and it spans a total of 781.58 km2 ( 301.77 sq mi ) - making it the largest city by area , the most populous city , and the fourth largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region . The city of Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century and due to its strategic location it served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas , becoming a stopping point for treasure-laden Spanish galleons returning to Spain . The King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592 . Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city . The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana 's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish-American War . The city is the center of the Cuban government , and home to various ministries , headquarters of businesses and over 90 diplomatic offices . The current governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba ( PCC ) . In 2009 , the city/province had the third highest income in the country . Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one : Old Havana , Vedado and the newer suburban districts . The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay , which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors : Mari melena , Guanabacoa and Antares . The sluggish Almendares River traverses the city from south to north , entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay ."
