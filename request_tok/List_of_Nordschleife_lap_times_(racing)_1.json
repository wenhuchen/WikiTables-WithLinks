  "/wiki/Ferrari_375_F1": "After finding only modest success with the supercharged 125 F1 car in Formula One , Ferrari decided to switch for 1950 to the naturally aspirated 4.5-litre formula for the series . Calling in Aurelio Lampredi to replace Gioacchino Colombo as technical director , Enzo Ferrari directed that the company work in stages to grow and develop an entirely new large-displacement V12 engine for racing . The first outcome of Lampredi 's work was the experimental 275 S. Just two of these racing barchettas were built , based on the 166 MM but using the experimental 3.3-litre V12 . These were raced at the Mille Miglia of 1950 on April 23 . Although one car held the overall lead for a time , both were forced to retire with mechanical failure before the end . The 275 F1 made its debut at the Grand Prix of Belgium on June 18 , sporting the same 3.3-litre ( 3322 cc/202 in\u00b3 ) version of Lampredi 's new engine . With three Weber 42DCF carburetors , a single overhead camshaft for each bank of cylinders , and two valves per cylinder , the engine produced a capable 300 hp ( 224 kW ) at 7200 rpm . Alberto Ascari drove the car to fifth place , marking the end of the 3.3-litre engine . The 275 was replaced at the Grand Prix of Nations at Geneva on July 30 , 1950 by the 340 F1 . As the name suggests , the car sported a larger 4.1-litre ( 4101.66 cc/250 in\u00b3 ) version of Lampredi 's V12 . Other changes included a new de Dion tube rear suspension based on that in the 166 F2 car and four-speed gearbox . It had a longer 2,420 mm ( 95 in ) wheelbase , but other dimensions remained the same .",

He was a multitalented racer who competed in motorcycle racing before switching to cars . Ascari won consecutive world titles in 1952 and 1953 for Scuderia Ferrari . He was the team 's first World Champion and the last Italian to date to win the title . This was sandwiched an appearance in the Indianapolis 500 in 1952 . Ascari also won the Mille Miglia in 1954 . Ascari was noted for the careful precision and finely-judged accuracy that made him one of the safest drivers in a most dangerous era . Ascari remains along with Michael Schumacher Ferrari 's only back-to-back World Champions , and he is also Ferrari 's sole Italian champion . As the first driver to win multiple World Championship titles , he held the record for most World Championship titles in 1952-54 , as a result he is one of 3 drivers to have held the record for most World Championship titles . Juan Manuel Fangio held the record in 1951-52 and 1954-2002 ( jointly with Ascari in 1952 and 1954 ) and Michael Schumacher has held the record since 2002 . When Alberto was a young child , his father , Antonio , who was also a famous racing driver , died in an accident at the 1925 French Grand Prix . Alberto once admitted that he warned his children not to become extremely close to him because of the risk involved in his profession .",
