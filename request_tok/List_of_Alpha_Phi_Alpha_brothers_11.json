Later , on 25 May 1765 , The Gambia was made a part of the British Empire when the government formally assumed control , establishing the Province of Senegambia . In 1965 , The Gambia gained independence under the leadership of Dawda Jawara , who ruled until Yahya Jammeh seized power in a bloodless 1994 coup . Adama Barrow became The Gambia 's third president in January 2017 , after defeating Jammeh in the December 2016 elections .

New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles .
