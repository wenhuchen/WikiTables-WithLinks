  "/wiki/Hydroelectric": "Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower . In 2015 , hydropower generated 16.6% of the world 's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity , and was expected to increase by about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years . Hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the Asia-Pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013 . China is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 920 TWh of production in 2013 , representing 16.9% of domestic electricity use . The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . The hydro station consumes no water , unlike coal or gas plants . The typical cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour . With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity , since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down very rapidly ( as little as a few seconds ) to adapt to changing energy demands . Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and it generally has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than photovoltaic power plants and certainly fossil fuel powered energy plants ( see also Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources ) . However , when constructed in lowland rainforest areas , where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary , they actually emit up to 3 to 4 times more greenhouse gases [ clarification needed ] ( see also Environmental_impact_of_reservoirs # Greenhouse_gases ) .",
  "/wiki/Dawson_City,_Yukon": "Dawson City , officially the Town of the City of Dawson , is a town in the Canadian territory of Yukon . It is inseparably linked to the Klondike Gold Rush ( 1896-99 ) . Its population was 1,375 as of the 2016 census , making it the second largest town of Yukon .",
  "/wiki/Diesel_generator": "A diesel generator ( also known as diesel genset ) is the combination of a diesel engine with an electric generator ( often an alternator ) to generate electrical energy . This is a specific case of engine-generator . A diesel compression-ignition engine is usually designed to run on diesel fuel , but some types are adapted for other liquid fuels or natural gas . Diesel generating sets are used in places without connection to a power grid , or as emergency power-supply if the grid fails , as well as for more complex applications such as peak-lopping , grid support and export to the power grid . Proper sizing of diesel generators is critical to avoid low-load or a shortage of power . Sizing is complicated by the characteristics of modern electronics , specifically non-linear loads . In size ranges around 50 MW and above , an open cycle gas turbine is more efficient at full load than an array of diesel engines , and far more compact , with comparable capital costs ; but for regular part-loading , even at these power levels , diesel arrays are sometimes preferred to open cycle gas turbines , due to their superior efficiencies .",
  "/wiki/Faro,_Yukon": "Faro is a town in the central Yukon , Canada , formerly the home of the Faro Mine , the largest open pit lead-zinc mine in the world as well as a significant producer of silver and other natural resource ventures . The mine was built by the Ralph M. Parsons Construction Company of the USA with General Enterprises Ltd. of Whitehorse being the main subcontractor . As of 2011 , the population is 344 , considerably lower than its peak of over 2,100 in February 1982 . Faro was named after the card game . [ citation needed ] As these industries have declined over the past decade , Faro is attempting to attract eco-tourists to the region to view such animals as Dall 's sheep and Stone 's sheep , a species of mountain sheep almost unique to the surrounding area . Several viewing platforms have been constructed in and around the town . One unusual feature of Faro is that it has a golf course running through the main part of town . Lorne Greene , famous for his work in Bonanza , once narrated a film about Faro called A New World in the Yukon .",
  "/wiki/Whitehorse,_Yukon": "Whitehorse is the capital and only city of Yukon , and the largest city in northern Canada . It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 ( Historic Mile 918 ) on the Alaska Highway in southern Yukon . Whitehorse 's downtown and Riverdale areas occupy both shores of the Yukon River , which originates in British Columbia and meets the Bering Sea in Alaska . The city was named after the White Horse Rapids for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse , near Miles Canyon , before the river was dammed . Because of the city 's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the Pacific Ocean , the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as Yellowknife . At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight . Whitehorse , as reported by Guinness World Records , is the city with the least air pollution in the world . As of the 2016 census , the population was 25,085 . This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory .",
  "/wiki/Wind_Power": "Wind power or wind energy is the use of wind to provide the mechanical power through wind turbines to turn electric generators and traditionally to do other work , like milling or pumping . Wind power is a sustainable and renewable energy , and has a much smaller impact on the environment compared to burning fossil fuels . Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines , which are connected to the electric power transmission network . Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power , competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants . Onshore wind farms also have an impact on the landscape , as typically they need to be spread over more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas , which can lead to industrialization of the countryside and habitat loss . Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land and offshore farms have less visual impact , but construction and maintenance costs are higher . Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations . Wind is an intermittent energy source , which can not make electricity nor be dispatched on demand . It also gives variable power , which is consistent from year to year but varies greatly over shorter time scales . Therefore , it must be used together with other electric power sources or storage to give a reliable supply . As the proportion of wind power in a region increases , more conventional power sources are needed to back it up ( such as fossil fuel power and nuclear power ) , and the grid may need to be upgraded . Power-management techniques such as having dispatchable power sources , enough hydroelectric power , excess capacity , geographically distributed turbines , exporting and importing power to neighboring areas , energy storage , or reducing demand when wind production is low , can in many cases overcome these problems .",
  "/wiki/Mayo,_Yukon": "Mayo is a village in Yukon , Canada , along the Silver Trail and the Stewart River . The population at the 2016 census was 200 , a decrease of 11.5% from the 2011 census . The Yukon Bureau of Statistics speaks of 496 residents as of 31 March 2019 , in Mayo . It is also the home of the First Nation of Na-Cho Ny\u00e4k Dun , whose primary language is Northern Tutchone . Na-Cho Ny\u00e4k Dun translates into big river people . The community , formerly called Mayo Landing , is serviced by Mayo Airport . The village was named after former circus acrobat turned settler and explorer Alfred Mayo . Its only school is J. V. Clark School , which is named after Dr. Clark . The school had about 70 students in 2012 . The current Principal is Rosemary Popadynec .",
  "/wiki/Schwatka_Lake": "Schwatka Lake is a reservoir created by the damming of the Yukon River in Whitehorse , Yukon , completed in 1958 . The dam provides electrical power generation and is operated by the Yukon Energy Corporation . The White Horse Rapids , which gave the city its name , are now under the lake . The lake was named after Frederick Schwatka , a US Army Lieutenant who was first to explore the total length of the Yukon River . A fish ladder has been constructed around the hydroelectric dam to allow the passage of Chinook salmon to their spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse . The Chinook salmon that pass the dam have the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon , over 3,000 kilometres to the mouth of the Yukon River in the Bering Sea . Whitehorse Water Aerodrome , a float plane base , is located on the lake . The lake has been the city 's water supply for some years , but the city is now converting to rely entirely on aquifers , partly due to the threat of pollution from fuel spills and other activities by people in the watershed of the lake . Previously , there had been talk of moving the float plane base or the water supply to Fish Lake , which is impractically located to the west over a winding , steep road ."
