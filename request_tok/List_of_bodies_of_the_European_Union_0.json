  "/wiki/European_Parliament": "The European Parliament ( EP ) is the legislative branch of the European Union and one of its seven institutions . Together with the Council of the European Union , it adopts European legislation , normally on a proposal from the European Commission . The Parliament is composed of 705 members ( MEPs ) . The Parliament represents the second-largest democratic electorate in the world ( after the Parliament of India ) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world ( 375 million eligible voters in 2009 ) . Since 1979 , it has been directly elected every five years by European Union citizens , using universal suffrage . Voter turnout for parliamentary elections has decreased at each election after 1979 until 2019 , when the voter turnout increased by 8 percentage points and went above 50% for the first time since 1994 . Voting age is 18 in all member states except Malta and Austria , where it is 16 , and Greece , where it is 17 . Although the European Parliament has legislative power , as does the Council , it does not formally possess legislative initiative ( which is the prerogative of the European Commission ) , as most national parliaments of European Union member states do . The Parliament is the first institution of the EU ( mentioned first in the treaties , having ceremonial precedence over all authority at the European level ) , and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council ( except in a few areas where the special legislative procedures apply ) . It likewise has equal control over the EU budget . Finally , the European Commission , the executive body of the EU ( it exercises executive powers , but no legislative ones other than legislative initiative ) , is accountable to Parliament . In particular , Parliament can decide whether or not to approve the European Council 's nominee for the President of the Commission , and it is further tasked with approving ( or rejecting ) the appointment of the Commission as a whole .",

It covers 162 km2 ( 63 sq mi ) , a relatively small area compared to the two other regions , and has a population of over 1.2 million . The metropolitan area of Brussels comprises over 2.5 million people , which makes it the largest in Belgium . It is also part of a large conurbation extending towards Ghent , Antwerp , Leuven and Walloon Brabant , home to over 5 million people . Brussels grew from a small rural settlement on the river Senne to become an important city-region in Europe . Since the end of the Second World War , it has been a major centre for international politics and home to numerous international organisations , politicians , diplomats and civil servants . Brussels is the de facto capital of the European Union , as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions , including its administrative-legislative , executive-political , and legislative branches ( though the judicial branch is located in Luxembourg , and the European Parliament meets for a minority of the year in Strasbourg ) [ c ] . Its name is sometimes used metonymically to describe the EU and its institutions . The secretariat of the Benelux and headquarters of NATO are also located in Brussels .

There is one member per member state , but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state . One of the 27 is the Commission President ( currently Ursula von der Leyen ) proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament .
