  "/wiki/Monkey": "Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals , in part , the simians of infraorder Simiiformes . The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates , such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys . Many monkey species are tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) , although there are species that live primarily on the ground , such as baboons . Most species are also active during the day ( diurnal ) . Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent , especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini . Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago . New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago . Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago . Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [ 35-32 million years ago ] , eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists . Lemurs , lorises , and galagos are not monkeys ; instead they are strepsirrhine primates . Like monkeys , tarsiers are haplorhine primates ; however , they are also not monkeys . Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini , so cladistically they are monkeys as well .",

  "/wiki/Bigfoot": "In North American folklore , Bigfoot or Sasquatch are said to be hairy , upright-walking , ape-like creatures that dwell in the wilderness and leave footprints . Depictions often portray them as a missing link between humans and human ancestors or other great apes . They are strongly associated with the Pacific Northwest ( particularly Oregon , Washington and British Columbia ) , Northern California , and individuals claim to see the creatures across North America . Over the years , these creatures have inspired numerous commercial ventures and hoaxes . The plural nouns 'Bigfoots ' and 'Bigfeet ' are both in use . Folklorists trace the figure of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources , including folklore surrounding the European wild man figure , folk belief among Native Americans and loggers , and a cultural increase in environmental concerns . A majority of scientists have historically discounted the existence of Bigfoot , considering it to be a combination of folklore , misidentification , and hoax , rather than living animals .",

  "/wiki/Jefferson_(proposed_Pacific_state)": "The State of Jefferson is a proposed U.S. state that would span the contiguous , mostly rural area of southern Oregon and northern California , where several attempts to separate from Oregon and California , respectively , have taken place . This region on the Pacific Coast is the most famous of several that have sought to adopt the name of Thomas Jefferson , the third President of the United States . Jefferson , who sent the Lewis and Clark expedition into the Pacific Northwest in 1803 , envisioned the establishment of an independent nation in the western portion of North America that he dubbed the Republic of the Pacific ; hence , the association of his name with regional autonomy . The independence movement , rather than statehood , is known as Cascadia . This region encompasses most of Northern California 's land but does not include San Francisco or other Bay Area counties that account for the majority of Northern California 's population . The name Jefferson has also been used for other proposed states : the name was proposed in the 19th century for Jefferson Territory ( roughly modern Colorado ) , as well as in 1915 in a bill in the Texas Legislature for a proposed state that would be created from the Texas Panhandle region . If the proposal were ever approved , the new state 's capital city would have to be determined by a constitutional convention . Yreka , California , was named the provisional capital in the original 1941 proposal , although Port Orford , Oregon , had also been up for consideration . Some supporters of the more recent revival have also identified Redding , California , as a potential capital , even though Redding is not included in all versions of the proposal and its City Council voted in 2013 to reject participation in the movement .",

It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies . The chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo ( sometimes called the pygmy chimpanzee ) are classified in the genus Pan . Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is humans ' closest living relative . The chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair , but has a bare face , fingers , toes , palms of the hands , and soles of the feet . It is larger and more robust than the bonobo , weighing 40-60 kg ( 88-132 lb ) for males and 27-50 kg ( 60-110 lb ) for females and standing 100 to 140 cm ( 3.3 to 4.6 ft ) . Its gestation period is eight months . The infant is weaned at about three years old , but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more . The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members , although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day . The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy , where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence . Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools , modifying sticks , rocks , grass and leaves and using them for hunting and acquiring honey , termites , ants , nuts and water . The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals .",

Hanuman is one of the central characters of the Indian epic Ramayana . He is a Brahmachari ( Life long celibate ) and one of the chiranjeevi . He is also mentioned in several other texts , such as the Mahabharata and the various Puranas . Hanuman is the son of Anjani and Kesari and is also son of the wind-god Pawan , who according to several stories , played a role in his Avatar . While Hanuman is one of the central characters in the ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana , the evidence of devotional worship to him is missing in the texts and archeological sites of ancient and most of the medieval period . According to Philip Lutgendorf , an American Indologist known for his studies on Hanuman , the theological significance and devotional dedication to Hanuman emerged about 1,000 years after the composition of the Ramayana , in the 2nd millennium CE , after the arrival of Islamic rule in the Indian subcontinent . Bhakti movement saints such as Samarth Ramdas expressed Hanuman as a symbol of nationalism and resistance to persecution . In the modern era , his iconography and temples have been increasingly common . He is viewed as the ideal combination of strength , heroic initiative and assertive excellence and loving , emotional devotion to his personal god Rama , as Shakti and Bhakti . In later literature , he has been the patron god of martial arts such as wrestling , acrobatics , as well as meditation and diligent scholarship .

Although bonobos are not a subspecies of chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) , but rather a distinct species in their own right , both species are sometimes referred to collectively using the generalized term chimpanzees , or chimps . Taxonomically , the members of the chimpanzee/bonobo subtribe Panina ( comprised entirely by the genus Pan ) are collectively termed panins . The bonobo is distinguished by relatively long legs , pink lips , dark face , tail-tuft through adulthood , and parted long hair on its head . The bonobo is found in a 500,000 km2 ( 190,000 sq mi ) area of the Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Central Africa . The species is omnivorous and inhabits primary and secondary forests , including seasonally inundated swamp forests . Because of political instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos , there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat . Along with the common chimpanzee , the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans . As the two species are not proficient swimmers , the formation of the Congo River 1.5-2 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the bonobo . Bonobos live south of the river , and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee , which live north of the river . There are no concrete data on population numbers , but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals . The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by habitat destruction and human population growth and movement , though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat .",

It is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature . Arthur Waley 's popular abridged translation , Monkey , is well known in English-speaking countries . The novel is an extended account of the legendary pilgrimage of the Tang dynasty Buddhist monk Xuanzang who traveled to the Western Regions , that is , Central Asia and India , to obtain Buddhist sacred texts ( s\u016btras ) and returned after many trials and much suffering . It retains the broad outline of Xuanzang 's own account , Great Tang Records on the Western Regions , but the Ming dynasty novel adds elements from folk tales and the author 's invention , that is , that Gautama Buddha gave this task to the monk ( referred to as Tang Sanzang in the novel ) and provided him with three protectors who agree to help him as an atonement for their sins . These disciples are Sun Wukong , Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing , together with a dragon prince who acts as Tang Sanzang 's steed , a white horse . Journey to the West has strong roots in Chinese folk religion , Chinese mythology , Confucianist , Taoist and Buddhist philosophy , and the pantheon of Taoist immortals and Buddhist bodhisattvas are still reflective of some Chinese religious attitudes today . Enduringly popular , the tale is at once a comic adventure story , a humorous satire of Chinese bureaucracy , a spring of spiritual insight , and an extended allegory in which the group of pilgrims journeys towards enlightenment by the power and virtue of cooperation .",
