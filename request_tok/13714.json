Due to the lead he had built in the first 120 meters , it was Bolt who crossed the line first in a time of 19.32 , already easing off before the line . In doing so , he became the first man in history to do the double double - winning both the 100 and 200 metres twice , back to back ( he would later break this record by winning the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay and completing the Double Triple , at the same Olympics ) .
