  "/wiki/1924_Cuba_hurricane": "The 1924 Cuba hurricane is the earliest officially classified Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale ( SSHS ) , and one of two hurricanes to make landfall on Cuba at Category 5 intensity , the other being Hurricane Irma in 2017 - both are also tied for the strongest Cuban landfall in terms of maximum sustained winds . The hurricane formed on October 14 in the western Caribbean , slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward . By October 16 , the storm attained hurricane status to the east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula , and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop . On October 18 , the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening and , on the next day , reached an estimated peak intensity of 165 mph ( 270 km/h ) . Shortly thereafter , it struck extreme western Cuba at peak intensity , becoming the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country . Later the hurricane weakened greatly , striking southwestern Florida with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km/h ) in a sparsely populated region . While crossing the state it weakened to tropical storm status , and after accelerating east-northeastward , it was absorbed by a cold front on October 23 , to the south of Bermuda . Across the western Caribbean Sea , the developing storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds . Strong winds in western Cuba caused severe damage , with two small towns nearly destroyed . About 90 people were killed in the country , all in Pinar del R\u00edo Province . Later , the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern Florida , which caused flooding and crop damage . Damage was light in the state , and there were no casualties .",

Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . Havana is the largest city and capital ; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey . The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

It was the fourth tropical cyclone , third hurricane , and only major hurricane of the year 's hurricane season . It developed off the west coast of Africa on September 6 as a tropical depression , but it strengthened into a tropical storm later that day , shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde islands . Further intensification was slow and halted late on September 7 . About 48 hours later , the storm strengthened and became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale . Still moving westward , the system reached Category 4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September 12 , where it brought great destruction and resulted in 1,200 deaths . The islands of Martinique , Montserrat , and Nevis also reported damage and fatalities , but not nearly as severe as in Guadeloupe . Around midday on September 13 , the storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane and peaked with sustained winds of 160 mph ( 260 km/h ) . About six hours later , the system made landfall in Puerto Rico ; it remains the only tropical cyclone on record to strike the island at Category 5 intensity , as of 2019 . Very strong winds resulted in severe damage in Puerto Rico ; 24,728 homes were destroyed and 192,444 were damaged throughout the island , leaving over 500,000 people homeless .

Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements . On September 23 , 1868 , Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule , declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Ricans as a distinct people , with right to sovereignty .",

The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on .

Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale . It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico . After moving across the Gulf of Mexico a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith , after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast , made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105 mph ( 170 km/h ) on September 16 . Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September 18 . The hurricane killed two people when it passed near Aruba . Striking northeastern Central America as a Category 5 hurricane , Edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35 people . In Texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage . Edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of Louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm . One tornado , rated F3 on the Fujita Scale , damaged several homes and injured multiple people in Baton Rouge .",

Managua is the country 's capital and largest city and is also the third-largest city in Central America , behind Tegucigalpa and Guatemala City . The multi-ethnic population of six million includes people of indigenous , European , African , and Asian heritage . The main language is Spanish . Indigenous tribes on the Mosquito Coast speak their own languages and English . Originally inhabited by various indigenous cultures since ancient times , the region was conquered by the Spanish Empire in the 16th century . Nicaragua gained independence from Spain in 1821 . The Mosquito Coast followed a different historical path , being colonized by the English in the 17th century and later coming under British rule . It became an autonomous territory of Nicaragua in 1860 and its northernmost part was transferred to Honduras in 1960 . Since its independence , Nicaragua has undergone periods of political unrest , dictatorship , occupation and fiscal crisis , including the Nicaraguan Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s and the Contra War of the 1980s . The mixture of cultural traditions has generated substantial diversity in folklore , cuisine , music , and literature , particularly the latter , given the literary contributions of Nicaraguan poets and writers such as Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo . Known as the land of lakes and volcanoes , Nicaragua is also home to the second-largest rainforest of the Americas .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Anita": "Hurricane Anita was a powerful Atlantic hurricane during an otherwise quiet 1977 Atlantic hurricane season . The first tropical cyclone of the season , Anita developed from a tropical wave on August 29 in the north-central Gulf of Mexico . It tracked westward into an area with conditions favorable for further development , and quickly intensified into a hurricane by late on August 30 . Initially , Anita was forecast to strike Texas , though a building ridge turned it to the west-southwest . The hurricane rapidly strengthened to attain peak winds of 175 mph ( 280 km/h ) , and on September 2 Anita made landfall in eastern Tamaulipas as a Category 5 hurricane . It quickly weakened as it crossed Mexico , and after briefly redeveloping into a tropical depression in the eastern Pacific Ocean , Anita dissipated on September 4 to the south of the Baja California Peninsula . The hurricane produced light rainfall and high tides along the Gulf Coast of the United States . Some low-level flooding was reported , but damage was slight . In Mexico , the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall . The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico , with about 25,000 people left homeless . The rainfall , reaching over 17.52 inches ( 445 mm ) , caused flooding and mudslides which killed eleven people in Tamaulipas . Overall damage is unknown .",

It is bordered to the north by the United States ; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean ; to the southeast by Guatemala , Belize , and the Caribbean Sea ; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico . Covering almost 2,000,000 square kilometers ( 770,000 sq mi ) , the nation is the fifth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent state in the world . With an estimated population of over 129 million people , Mexico is the tenth most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world , while being the second most populous nation in Latin America after Brazil . Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states plus Mexico City ( CDMX ) , which is the capital city and its most populous city . Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara , Monterrey , Puebla , Toluca , Tijuana , and Le\u00f3n . Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec , Toltec , Teotihuacan , Zapotec , Maya , and Aztec before first contact with Europeans . In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",

It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island , which it shares with the Republic of Haiti , making Hispaniola one of only two Caribbean islands , along with Saint Martin , that are shared by two sovereign states . The Dominican Republic is the second-largest nation in the Antilles by area ( after Cuba ) at 48,671 square kilometers ( 18,792 sq mi ) , and third by population with approximately 10.5 million people ( 2020 est . ) , of whom approximately 3.3 million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo , the capital city . The native Ta\u00edno people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of the Europeans , dividing it into five chiefdoms . The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years , and lived around the Caribbean islands . The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization . Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island , landing here on his first voyage in 1492 . The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas , the oldest continuously inhabited city , and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World . Meanwhile , France occupied the western third of Hispaniola , naming their colony Saint-Domingue , which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804 . After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821 . The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres , intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia , but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822 .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Allen": "Hurricane Allen was a rare and extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that struck the Caribbean , eastern and northern Mexico , and southern Texas in August 1980 . The first named storm and first tropical cyclone of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season , it was the fifth most intense Atlantic Hurricane on record in terms of barometric pressure , behind Hurricane Rita , the 1935 Labor Day hurricane , Hurricane Gilbert , and Hurricane Wilma . It was one of the few hurricanes to reach Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on three separate occasions , and spent more time as a Category 5 than all but two other Atlantic hurricanes . Allen is the only hurricane in the recorded history of the Atlantic basin to achieve sustained winds of 190 mph ( 305 km/h ) , [ nb 1 ] thus making it the strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed . Until Hurricane Patricia in 2015 , these were also the highest sustained winds in the Western Hemisphere . Throughout its life , Allen moved through the deep tropics on a westerly to north-westerly course through the tropical Atlantic Ocean , Caribbean Sea , and Gulf of Mexico before making its final landfall near the United States-Mexico border . At peak strength , it passed near Haiti , causing hundreds of deaths and heavy damage . After crossing the Gulf of Mexico , Allen weakened as it struck the lower Texas coast , causing high winds , a significant storm surge , and heavy rainfall , which caused damage to southern Texas . Overall , Allen killed at least 269 people and left $ 2.57 billion in damages ( 1980 US dollars ) , mostly within the United States and Haiti . Because of its impact , the name Allen was retired from the six-year revolving list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names in 1981 and the name was replaced by Andrew . The name Andrew was subsequently retired after the 1992 season 's Hurricane Andrew . The remnants of the storm precipitated the end of the heat wave of 1980 in places like Dallas/Fort Worth , Texas , which had recorded 69 days of 100 \u00b0F ( 38 \u00b0C ) heat .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Gilbert": "Hurricane Gilbert was an extremely powerful tropical cyclone that formed during the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season , peaked as a Category 5 strength hurricane that brought widespread destruction to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico , and is tied with 1969 's Hurricane Camille as the second-most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Atlantic Ocean . Gilbert was also one of the largest tropical cyclones ever observed in the Atlantic basin . At one point , its tropical storm-force winds measured 575 mi ( 925 km ) in diameter . In addition , Gilbert was the most intense tropical cyclone in recorded history to strike Mexico . Gilbert is also the second most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin in terms of barometric pressure , only behind Hurricane Wilma in 2005 . The seventh named storm and third hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season , Gilbert developed from a tropical wave on September 8 while located 400 mi ( 640 km ) east of Barbados . Following intensification into a tropical storm the next day , Gilbert steadily strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward into the Caribbean Sea . On September 10 , Gilbert attained hurricane intensity , and rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane on September 11 . After striking Jamaica the following day , rapid intensification occurred once again , and the storm became a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale late on September 13 . Gilbert then weakened slightly , and made landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula later that day while maintaining Category 5 intensity . After landfall , Gilbert weakened rapidly over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula , and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 storm on September 15 . Gradual intensification occurred as Gilbert tracked across the Gulf of Mexico , and the storm made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane in mainland Mexico on September 16 .",

It is divided into 11 municipalities and its capital city is Chetumal . Quintana Roo is located on the eastern part of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and is bordered by the states of Campeche to the west and Yucat\u00e1n to the northwest , and by the Orange Walk and Corozal districts of Belize , along with an offshore borderline with Belize District to the south . As Mexico 's easternmost state , Quintana Roo has a coastline to the east with the Caribbean Sea and to the north with the Gulf of Mexico . The state previously covered 44,705 square kilometers ( 17,261 sq mi ) and shared a small border with Guatemala in the southwest of the state . However , in 2013 , Mexico 's Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation resolved the boundary dispute between Quintana Roo , Campeche , and Yucat\u00e1n stemming from the creation of the Calakmul municipality by Campeche in 1997 , siding with Campeche and thereby benefiting Yucat\u00e1n . Quintana Roo is the home of the city of Canc\u00fan , the islands of Cozumel and Isla Mujeres , and the towns of Bacalar , Playa del Carmen and Akumal , as well as the ancient Maya ruins of Chacchoben , Cob\u00e1 , Kohunlich , Muyil , Tulum , Xel-H\u00e1 , and Xcaret . The Sian Ka'an biosphere reserve is also located in the state . The statewide population is expanding at a rapid rate due to the construction of hotels and the demand for workers . Many migrants come from Yucat\u00e1n , Campeche , Tabasco , and Veracruz . The state is frequently hit by severe hurricanes due to its exposed location , the most recent and severe being Hurricane Dean in 2007 , which made landfall with sustained winds of 280 km/h ( 170 mph ) , with gusts up to 320 km/h ( 200 mph ) .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Hugo": "Hurricane Hugo was a powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread damage and loss of life in Guadeloupe , Saint Croix , St. Thomas , Puerto Rico , and the Southeast United States . It formed over the eastern Atlantic near the Cape Verde Islands on September 9 , 1989 . Hugo moved thousands of miles across the Atlantic , rapidly strengthening to briefly attain Category 5 hurricane strength on its journey . It later crossed over Guadeloupe , St. Croix and St. Thomas on September 17 and 18 as a Category 4 hurricane . Weakening slightly more , it passed over Puerto Rico as a strong Category 3 hurricane . Further weakening occurred several hours after re-emerging into the Atlantic , becoming downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane . However , it re-strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall just slightly north of Charleston , on Isle of Palms on September 22 , with 140 mph sustained winds ( gusts to more than 160 mph ) . Hugo had weakened into a remnant low near Lake Erie by the next day . Hugo is the most intense tropical cyclone to strike the East Coast north of Florida since 1898 . Hurricane Hugo caused 34 fatalities ( most by electrocution or drowning ) in the Caribbean and 27 in South Carolina , left nearly 100,000 homeless , and resulted in $ 9.47 billion ( 1989 USD ) in damage overall , making it the most damaging hurricane ever recorded at the time . Of this total , $ 7 billion was from the United States and Puerto Rico , ranking it as the costliest storm to impact the country at the time . Additionally , Hugo was the easternmost Category 5 Atlantic hurricane ever recorded until it was surpassed by Hurricane Lorenzo in 2019 ."
