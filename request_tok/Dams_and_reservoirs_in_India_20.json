  "/wiki/Godavari_River": "The Godavari is India 's second longest river after the Ganga . Its source is in Triambakeshwar , Maharashtra . It flows east for 1,465 kilometres ( 910 mi ) , draining the states of Maharashtra ( 48.6% ) , Telangana ( 18.8% ) , Andhra Pradesh ( 4.5% ) , Chhattisgarh ( 10.9% ) , Odisha ( 5.7% ) , ultimately emptying into the Bay of Bengal through its extensive network of tributaries . Measuring up to 312,812 km2 ( 120,777 sq mi ) , it forms one of the largest river basins in the Indian subcontinent , with only the Ganga and Indus rivers having a larger drainage basin . In terms of length , catchment area and discharge , the Godavari is the largest in peninsular India , and had been dubbed as the Vridha Ganga . The river has been revered in Hindu scriptures for many millennia and continues to harbour and nourish a rich cultural heritage . In the past few decades , the river has been barricaded by a number of barrages and dams , keeping a head of water ( depth ) which lowers evaporation . Its broad river delta houses 729 persons/km2 - nearly twice the Indian average population density and has substantial risk of flooding , which in lower parts will be exacerbated as the global sea level rises .",
