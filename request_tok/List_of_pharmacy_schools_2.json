  "/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia": "The University of Western Australia ( UWA ) is a public research university in the Australian state of Western Australia . The university 's main campus is in Perth , the state capital , with a secondary campus in Albany and various other facilities elsewhere . UWA was established in 1911 by an act of the Parliament of Western Australia and began teaching students two years later . It is the sixth-oldest university in Australia and was Western Australia 's only university until the establishment of Murdoch University in 1973 . Because of its age and reputation , UWA is classed one of the sandstone universities , an informal designation given to the oldest university in each state . The university also belongs to several more formal groupings , including the Group of Eight and the Matariki Network of Universities . In recent years , UWA has generally been ranked either in the bottom half or just outside the world 's top 100 universities , depending on the system used . Alumni of UWA include one Prime Minister of Australia ( Bob Hawke ) , five Justices of the High Court of Australia ( including one Chief Justice , Robert French , now Chancellor ) , one Governor of the Reserve Bank ( H. C. Coombs ) , various federal cabinet ministers , and seven of Western Australia 's eight most recent premiers . In 2018 alumnus mathematician Akshay Venkatesh was a recipient of the Fields Medal . In 2014 , the university produced its 100th Rhodes Scholar . Two members of the UWA faculty , Barry Marshall and Robin Warren won Nobel Prizes as a result of research at the university .",
  "/wiki/Perth": "Perth ( /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0r\u03b8/ ( listen ) PURTH ) is the capital and largest city of the Australian state of Western Australia ( WA ) . It is named after the city of Perth , Scotland and is Australia 's fourth-most populous city , with a population of 2.06 million living in Greater Perth . Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations . As part of Perth 's role as the capital of Western Australia , the state 's Parliament and Supreme Court are in the city , as is Government House , the residence of the Governor of Western Australia ."
