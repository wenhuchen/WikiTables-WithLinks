  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",
  "/wiki/GE_C32-8": "The GE C32-8 was a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive model built by GE Transportation Systems in 1984 . It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives . Only 10 of these 3,200 hp ( 2,390 kW ) locomotives were built . They were some of the first locomotives built in the DASH-8 line with all 10 going to Conrail as road numbers 6610 to 6619 . When delivered they wore the standard Conrail Can Opener ( Wheel on Rail ) paint scheme . In 1997 Conrail assigned all 10 units to Ballast Express service . They were repainted into a Gray version of the Quality scheme .",

  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",

  "/wiki/GE_C39-8": "The GE C39-8 is a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive model built by GE Transportation Systems between 1984 and 1987 . It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives . A total of 161 examples of this locomotive were built for two North American railroads : Conrail and Norfolk Southern Railway . The C39-8 was a fairly unpopular locomotive with crews , cited factors such as a rough ride , tendency to overheat , frequent turbocharger issues , issues with the fuel injection system , and various other reliability issues .

  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-40C": "The GE C40-8 is a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems between 1987 and 1992 . It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives , and its wheel arrangement is of a C-C type . This locomotive model is often referred to as a Dash 8-40C or simply Dash 8 . Dash 8 in general refers to the electrical control series , Dash being a carryover from the older syntax of C40-8 . The 40 refers to the baseline horsepower rating ( 4,000 hp or 3,000 kW ) of the unit , although some units may be re-rated to 4,100 hp ( 3,100 kW ) . Later units were supplied with a wide-nose cab and are designated Dash 8-40CW , the W indicating a wide-nose cab .",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-40CM": "The GE C40-8M is a 6-axle diesel locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems from 1990 to 1994 . It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives , and is often referred to as a Dash 8-40CM . Mechanically identical to the Dash 8-40CW , the Dash 8-40CM was constructed only for Canadian railways , with a production total of 84 units . It is distinguished from the Dash 8-40CW by the addition of a full-width cowl body and the use of a Canada-specific nose and windshield configuration . The trucks also differ ; all units built ride on Dofasco trucks identical to locomotives built by Montreal Locomotive Works , Bombardier , and Morrison-Knudsen .",

Often referred to as a Dash 8-40CW , it is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives . This locomotive model is distinguished from the predecessor Dash 8-40C by the addition of a newer wide or safety cab . A cowl-bodied version of this locomotive , built only for the Canadian market , was the GE Dash 8-40CM .",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8.5-40CW": "The GE Dash 8.5-40CW is 6-axle a 4,000 hp ( 2,800 kW ) diesel-electric locomotive originally built by GE Transportation Systems , rebuilt by Norfolk Southern at its shops in Roanoke , VA . The first locomotive started rebuild 2012 . The locomotive is designed to meet Tier 2 emissions standards . All of the Dash 8.5-40CW 's excluding 8500 and 8505 have been rebuilt with the Norfolk Southern-designed wide-nose RLS cab which meets current FRA crashworthiness standards . 8500 was rebuilt with an SD60E style Norfolk Southern-designed Crescent cab while 8505 was rebuilt with an ES44AC style GE cab . They have been equipped with the Traction and Engine Control Unit ( TECU ) from TMV Control Systems , upgraded from Manual Fuel Injection ( MFI ) , to Electronic Fuel Injection ( EFI ) , and equipped with NS-designed split cooling system . The rebuild also includes the installation of locomotive speed limiter ( LSL ) , and cab signals . The traction motors were upgraded from GE752-AG to GE752-AH . They were also equipped with CCB 26 electronic air braking system , and an electric parking brake . PTC has also been installed . As of April 2016 , the program has been canceled . Norfolk Southern experienced many problems with the first of the locomotives .",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-44CW": "The GE C44-8W is a 4,400 hp ( 3,280 kW ) diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems of Erie , Pennsylvania . It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives . They are considered to be pre-production Dash 9s with the innards of it but trapped in an extended Dash 8 carbody as well as having the trucks . They are numbered 9000-9052 . The first three were originally supposed to be the last order of Dash 8s for CSX thus having the smaller Dash 8 carbody . They have been derated to 4000 horsepower and are now designated C40-9W . In keeping in GE tradition of giving nicknames to its locomotive series beginning with the Dash 7 of the 1970s , the C44-8W was dubbed the Dash 8 upon its debut . The design has since proven popular with North America railroads ."
