  "/wiki/Fiholm_Castle": "Fiholm Manor is a Landed Estate located approximately 20 km West of Eskilstuna in Eskilstuna Municipality , S\u00f6dermanland County , Sweden . It is privately owned . The Landed Estate of Fiholm was commissioned by the Swedish statesman Axel Oxenstierna in 1640 to the plans of the French architect Simon de Vall\u00e9e . The two standing buildings ( wings ) were drawn up in a French-Dutch Renaissance style and completed in 1642 , representing some of the finest kept examples of fine Swedish architecture of that period . Construction works at Fiholm were overseen by the elder Nikodemus Tessin , then only 25 years old , and the intention was that the two standing buildings should become wings to a magnificent stately Manor House . Sadly the Manor House was never realised . The nearby located J\u00e4der Church was built by Oxenstierna at the same time , and can through its grandeur indicate what might have been . J\u00e4ders kyrka remains to this day the burial church for the Oxenstierna family .",
