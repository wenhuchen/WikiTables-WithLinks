  "/wiki/Geographic_Names_Information_System": "The Geographic Names Information System ( GNIS ) is a database that contains name and locative information about more than two million physical and cultural features located throughout the United States of America and its territories . It is a type of gazetteer . GNIS was developed by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the United States Board on Geographic Names ( BGN ) to promote the standardization of feature names . The database is part of a system that includes topographic map names and bibliographic references . The names of books and historic maps that confirm the feature or place name are cited . Variant names , alternatives to official federal names for a feature , are also recorded . Each feature receives a permanent , unique feature record identifier , sometimes called the GNIS identifier . The database never removes an entry , except in cases of obvious duplication .",
