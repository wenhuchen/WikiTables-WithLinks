  "/wiki/Emergency_medicine": "Emergency medicine , also known as accident and emergency medicine , is the medical specialty concerned with the care of illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention . Emergency physicians care for unscheduled and undifferentiated patients of all ages . As first-line providers , their primary responsibility is to initiate resuscitation and stabilization and to start investigations and interventions to diagnose and treat illnesses in the acute phase . Emergency physicians generally practise in hospital emergency departments , pre-hospital settings via emergency medical services , and intensive care units , but may also work in primary care settings such as urgent care clinics . Sub-specializations of emergency medicine include disaster medicine , medical toxicology , ultrasonography , critical care medicine , hyperbaric medicine , sports medicine , palliative care , or aerospace medicine . Different models for emergency medicine exist internationally . In countries following the Anglo-American model , emergency medicine was originally the domain of surgeons , general practitioners , and other generalist physicians , but in recent decades it has become recognised as a speciality in its own right with its own training programmes and academic posts , and the specialty is now a popular choice among medical students and newly qualified medical practitioners . By contrast , in countries following the Franco-German model , the speciality does not exist and emergency medical care is instead provided directly by anesthesiologists ( for critical resuscitation ) , surgeons , specialists in internal medicine , pediatricians , cardiologists or neurologists as appropriate . In developing countries , emergency medicine is still evolving and international emergency medicine programs offer hope of improving basic emergency care where resources are limited .",
