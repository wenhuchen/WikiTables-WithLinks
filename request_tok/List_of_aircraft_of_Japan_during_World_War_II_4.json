The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ( JMSDF ) was formed circa 1952-1954 after the dissolution of the IJN . The Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest navy in the world by 1920 , behind the Royal Navy and the United States Navy ( USN ) . It was supported by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet . It was the primary opponent of the Western Allies in the Pacific War . The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy go back to early interactions with nations on the Asian continent , beginning in the early medieval period and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of cultural exchange with European powers during the Age of Discovery . After two centuries of stagnation during the country 's ensuing seclusion policy under the sh\u014dgun of the Edo period , Japan 's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by American intervention in 1854 . This eventually led to the Meiji Restoration . Accompanying the re-ascendance of the Emperor came a period of frantic modernization and industrialization . The navy had several successes , sometimes against much more powerful enemies such as in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War , before being largely destroyed in World War II .",

The Kawanishi N1K-J Shiden ( \u7d2b\u96fb Violet Lightning ) was an Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service land-based version of the N1K . Assigned the reporting name George , the N1K-J was considered by both its pilots and opponents to be one of the finest land-based fighters flown by the Japanese during World War II . The Shiden Kai possessed heavy armament as well as surprisingly good maneuverability , due to a mercury switch that automatically extended the flaps during turns . These combat flaps created more lift , thereby allowing tighter turns . Unlike the Mitsubishi A6M Zero , the Shiden Kai could compete against the best late-war Allied fighters , such as the F6F Hellcat , F4U Corsair , and P-51 Mustang .",

  "/wiki/Mitsubishi_A6M_Zero": "The Mitsubishi A6M Zero is a long-range fighter aircraft formerly manufactured by Mitsubishi Aircraft Company , a part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , and operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1940 to 1945 . The A6M was designated as the Mitsubishi Navy Type 0 carrier fighter ( \u96f6\u5f0f\u8266\u4e0a\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f , rei-shiki-kanj\u014d-sent\u014dki ) , or the Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen . The A6M was usually referred to by its pilots as the Reisen ( \u96f6\u6226 , zero fighter ) , 0 being the last digit of the imperial year 2600 ( 1940 ) when it entered service with the Imperial Navy . The official Allied reporting name was Zeke , although the use of the name Zero ( from Type 0 ) was used colloquially by the Allies as well . The Zero is considered to have been the most capable carrier-based fighter in the world when it was introduced early in World War II , combining excellent maneuverability and very long range . The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service ( IJNAS ) also frequently used it as a land-based fighter . In early combat operations , the Zero gained a reputation as a dogfighter , achieving an outstanding kill ratio of 12 to 1 , but by mid-1942 a combination of new tactics and the introduction of better equipment enabled Allied pilots to engage the Zero on generally equal terms . By 1943 , due to inherent design weaknesses , such as a lack of hydraulic ailerons and rudder rendering it extremely unmaneuverable at high speeds , and an inability to equip it with a more powerful aircraft engine , the Zero gradually became less effective against newer Allied fighters . By 1944 , with opposing Allied fighters approaching its levels of maneuverability and consistently exceeding its firepower , armor , and speed , the A6M had largely become outdated as a fighter aircraft . However , as design delays and production difficulties hampered the introduction of newer Japanese aircraft models , the Zero continued to serve in a front-line role until the end of the war in the Pacific . During the final phases , it was also adapted for use in kamikaze operations . Japan produced more Zeros than any other model of combat aircraft during the war .",

The Allies gave the G4M the reporting name Betty . Japanese Navy pilots called it Hamaki ( \u8449\u5dfb , cigar , lit . leaf roll ) due to its cylindrical shape . The G4M had very good performance , especially in operational range ; this was achieved by its structural lightness and an almost total lack of protection for the crew , with no armor plating or self-sealing fuel tanks .
