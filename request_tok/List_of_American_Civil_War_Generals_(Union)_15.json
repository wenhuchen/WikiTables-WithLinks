It has the fifth largest gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sixth largest population , and the 25th largest land area of all U.S. states . Illinois has been noted as a microcosm of the entire United States . With Chicago in northeastern Illinois , small industrial cities and immense agricultural productivity in the north and center of the state , and natural resources such as coal , timber , and petroleum in the south , Illinois has a diverse economic base , and is a major transportation hub . Chicagoland , Chicago 's metropolitan area , encompasses over 65% of the state 's population . The Port of Chicago connects the state to international ports via two main routes : from the Great Lakes , via the Saint Lawrence Seaway , to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River , via the Illinois Waterway to the Illinois River . The Mississippi River , the Ohio River , and the Wabash River form parts of the boundaries of Illinois . For decades , Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world 's busiest airports . Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and , through the 1980s , in politics . The capital of Illinois is Springfield , which is located in the central part of the state . Although today Illinois 's largest population center is in its northeast , the state 's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River , when the region was known as Illinois Country and was part of New France . Following the American Revolutionary War , American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1780s via the Ohio River , and the population grew from south to north .",

  "/wiki/Superintendent_of_the_United_States_Military_Academy": "The Superintendent of the United States Military Academy is its commanding officer . This position is roughly equivalent to the chancellor or president of an American civilian university . The officer appointed is , by tradition , a graduate of the United States Military Academy , commonly known as West Point . However , this is not an official requirement for the position . The Superintendency had often been a stepping stone to higher prominence in the Army . Four Superintendents became Chief of Staff of the Army : Hugh Lenox Scott , Douglas MacArthur , Maxwell Davenport Taylor , and William Westmoreland . The list of Superintendents includes five Medal of Honor recipients : Oliver Otis Howard , Douglas MacArthur , Albert Leopold Mills , John McAllister Schofield , John Moulder Wilson . Many Superintendents later became Commanding Generals , such as Joseph Gardner Swift . The post is now a terminal assignment in the Army ; as a condition for detail to the position , officers are required by law to acknowledge that they will retire at the end of their appointment . This formulation was meant to secure the independence of Superintendents from unlawful command influence ; however , in practice the resulting lame duck status restricts their power and influence in the Army . There has been discussion about reverting to the previous system or recalling a retired officer to fill the post . The billet carries the rank of lieutenant general , and is not counted against the Army 's statutory limit on the number of active-duty officers above the rank of major general .",

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south . On the second day of battle , most of both armies had assembled . The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook .",

Earlier in the year , his subordinate Union Gen. George Crook had met Rebecca Wright , a Quaker schoolteacher and Union sympathizer in Winchester , a commercial center and transportation hub at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley with many Confederate sympathizers and which changed hands 75 times during the war . Slave Thomas Laws of Millwood ( between Berryville and Winchester ) had a Confederate permit to sell produce in Winchester three days per week , and agreed to act as a Union spy . On September 16 , Laws took Sheridan 's letter ( hidden in his mouth ) to Wright , who consulted her mother and then replied ( in a note which Laws also hid in his mouth ) that a Confederate officer recovering from his wounds had recently bragged about Confederate artillery and infantry battalions under General Joseph B. Kershaw and Lt. Col. Wilfred E. Cutshaw having left Winchester to raid the B & O Railroad at Martinsburg , in the new state of West Virginia . Accordingly , Sheridan advanced toward Winchester along the Berryville Pike with the VI Corps and XIX Corps , crossing Opequon Creek . The Union advance was delayed long enough for Early to concentrate his forces to meet the main assault , which continued for several hours . Casualties were very heavy . The Confederate line was gradually driven back toward the town . Mid-afternoon , the Army of West Virginia and the cavalry turned the Confederate left flank . Early ordered a general retreat .",
