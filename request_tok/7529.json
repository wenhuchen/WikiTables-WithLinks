  "/wiki/Kim_Gwang-suk": "Kim Gwang-suk ( alternative transliteration Kim Kwang-suk , Korean : \uae40\uad11\uc219 ; born 15 February , year unknown ; 1976 or 1978 theorized ) is a North Korean female gymnast who competed in the 1992 Summer Olympics . She is known for both her exemplary uneven bars work and for her involvement in one of the most prominent age falsification scandals in gymnastics in recent years . Kim competed in several major international senior meets between 1989 and 1993 , including the 1989 and 1991 World Championships , the 1990 Asian Games and the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona . She was the 1991 World Champion on the uneven bars , winning the event with a perfect 10.0 score and a routine that included an original release move , the Counter-Kim . Her ten would be the very last to ever be awarded in World Championship competition . Due to her small stature and the fact that the North Korean Gymnastics Federation listed her given age as 15 for three consecutive years , questions arose about Kim 's age and eligibility for senior competition . By at least one estimate , she was as young as 11 when she competed at the 1989 World Championships . While her real age was never ascertained , it was discovered that the Federation had submitted inconsistent birth year information for her at least three times at three separate international competitions . As a result of the falsification , the North Korean women 's gymnastics team was banned from the 1993 World Championships .",
