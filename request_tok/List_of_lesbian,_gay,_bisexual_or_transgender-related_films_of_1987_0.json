A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era , Altman was considered a maverick in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic , unlike most Hollywood films . He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema . His style of filmmaking covered many genres , but usually with a subversive twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views . Altman developed a reputation for being anti-Hollywood and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style . However , actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise , thereby inspiring their own creativity . He preferred large ensemble casts for his films , and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors . This produced a more natural , more dynamic , and more complex experience for the viewer . He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen . Critic Pauline Kael , writing about his directing style , said that Altman could make film fireworks out of next to nothing . In 2006 , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman 's body of work with an Academy Honorary Award . He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations .",

The film , produced on a shoestring budget of 100,000 DM , explored the day-to-day life of a Berlin schoolteacher who also led a very active gay sex life . Extremely explicit for its day , and for some time afterward ( to the point where the film was not passed uncut by the British Board of Film Classification until 2011 ) , Taxi zum Klo was considered groundbreaking for the subject matter it portrayed , and achieved something of a cult status among gay audiences of the time . In 1987 , Ripploh directed a sequel entitled Taxi nach Kairo , but the film was not considered as successful as its predecessor , and it was not released outside Germany . Ripploh also participated in the creation of a small number of other art house films during the 1980s , and had a role in the 1982 movie Querelle directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder .

  "/wiki/New_Queer_Cinema": "New Queer Cinema is a term first coined by the academic B. Ruby Rich in Sight & Sound magazine in 1992 to define and describe a movement in queer-themed independent filmmaking in the early 1990s . The term developed from use of the word queer in academic writing in the 1980s and 1990s as an inclusive way of describing gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender identity and experience , and also defining a form of sexuality that was fluid and subversive of traditional understandings of sexuality . Also , the major film studio to discuss these issues was aptly named New Line Cinema with its Fine Line Features division . Since 1992 , the phenomenon has also been described by various other academics and has been used to describe several other films released since the 1990s . Films of the New Queer Cinema movement typically share certain themes , such as the rejection of heteronormativity and the lives of LGBT protagonists living on the fringe of society .",
