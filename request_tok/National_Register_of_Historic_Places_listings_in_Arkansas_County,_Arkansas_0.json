  "/wiki/Arkansas_Post_National_Memorial": "The Arkansas Post ( French : Poste de Arkansea ) was the first European settlement in the lower Mississippi River Valley and present-day Arkansas when Henri de Tonti established it in 1686 as a French trading post on the banks of the lower Arkansas River . The French and Spanish traded with the Quapaw for years , and the post was of strategic value to the French , Spanish , and Americans . It was designated as the first capital of the Arkansas Territory in 1819 , but lost that status to Little Rock in 1821 . During the years of fur trading , Arkansas Post was protected by a series of forts . The forts and associated settlements were located at three known sites and possibly a fourth , as the waterfront area was prone to erosion and flooding . The land encompassing the second ( and fourth ) Arkansas Post site ( Red Bluff ) was designated as a state park in 1929 . In 1960 about 758 acres ( 307 ha ) of land at the site were protected as a National Memorial and National Historic Landmark ; it commemorates the history of several cultures and time periods : the Quapaw , the French settlers who inhabited the small entrep\u00f4t as the first Arkansans , Spanish rule , an American Revolutionary War skirmish in 1783 , the first territorial capital of Arkansas , and an American Civil War battle in 1863 . Three archeological excavations have been conducted at the site , beginning in the 1950s . Experts say the most extensive cultural resources at the site are archeological , both for the 18th and 19th-century settlements , and the earlier Quapaw villages . Due to changes in the river and navigation measures , the water level has risen closer to the height of the bluffs , which used to be well above the river . The site is now considered low lying . Erosion and construction on the river have resulted in the remains of three of the historic forts being under water in the river channel .",
