  "/wiki/Topographic_prominence": "In topography , prominence [ a ] measures the height of a mountain or hill 's summit relative to the lowest contour line encircling it but containing no higher summit within it . It is a measure of the independence of a summit . A peak 's key col ( highest gap between two mountains ) is a unique point on this contour line and the parent peak is some higher mountain , selected according to various criteria .",
  "/wiki/Diablerets": "The Diablerets ( French : Les Diablerets ; lit . the abode of devils ) are a huge ice-covered mountain massif of the Alps , culminating at the Sommet des Diablerets ( VD , VS ) at 3,210 metres ( 10,530 ft ) above sea level and straddling the border between the Swiss cantons of Vaud ( VD ) and Valais ( VS ) . The northeastern part of the massif stretches also into the canton of Bern ( BE ) . The Diablerets massif , which consists of several peaks , extends for about 10 kilometres near the western extremity of the Bernese Alps , between the two deep passes , the Cheville Pass ( 2,038 m ( 6,686 ft ) ) right below the main summit to the south , and the Sanetsch/S\u00e9nin Pass ( 2,252 m ( 7,388 ft ) ) to the east . The mountain is covered by two distinct glaciers , the largest being the Tsanfleuron Glacier and the highest being the Diablerets Glacier . The main summit ( officially referred to as Sommet des Diablerets ) is the highest point in the canton of Vaud . In the latter canton , the mountain has given its name to the nearby village and resort of Les Diablerets , which lies on the north side of the massif . On the south side ( Valais ) the mountain overlooks the hamlet and valley of Derborence .",
  "/wiki/Alps": "The Alps ( /\u00e6lps/ ; French : Alpes [ alp ] ; German : Alpen [ \u02c8alpn\u0329 ] ( listen ) ; Italian : Alpi [ \u02c8alpi ] ; Romansh : Alps ; Slovene : Alpe [ \u02c8\u00e1\u02d0lp\u025b ] ) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe , [ note 1 ] and stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) across eight Alpine countries ( from west to east ) : France , Switzerland , Monaco , Italy , Liechtenstein , Austria , Germany , and Slovenia . The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided . Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn . Mont Blanc spans the French-Italian border , and at 4,810 m ( 15,781 ft ) is the highest mountain in the Alps . The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 metres ( 13,000 ft ) . The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe ; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones . Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of 3,400 m ( 11,155 ft ) , and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations . Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Palaeolithic era . A mummified man , determined to be 5,000 years old , was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian-Italian border in 1991 . By the 6th century BC , the Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture was well established . Hannibal famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants , and the Romans had settlements in the region . In 1800 , Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000 .",

The summit is the tripoint between the cantons of Vaud , Berne and Valais . The Oldenhorn is the second highest peak of the massif of the Diablerets and canton of Vaud . It overlooks the Tsanfleuron Glacier on the south and the Col du Pillon on the north . The summit can be easily reached by the east ridge in less than three hours . The nearby Scex Rouge ( 2,950 m ) is connected from the Col du Pillon by a cable car . The Tsanfleuron Glacier must be crossed .",
  "/wiki/Grand_Muveran": "The Grand Muveran is a mountain of the Bernese Alps , located on the border between the cantons of Vaud and Valais . At 3,051 metres , it is the highest summit of the group lying between the Rhone knee and the Pas de Cheville and the westernmost three-thousander of the Bernese Alps . The closest localities are Les Plans-sur-Bex ( municipality of Bex , Vaud ) and Ovronnaz ( Valais ) . It is accompanied by the smaller peak of Petit Muveran . Overlooking the Rhone valley from a height of about 2,600 metres , the Grand Muveran is the high point of a group ( referred to as the Muverans ) composed of several summits approaching 3,000 metres , including to the southwest the Dent de Morcles and the Dent Favre , and to the northeast the T\u00eate \u00e0 Pierre Grept and the Haut de Cry . The Muverans are the second highest massif of the canton of Vaud , after the Diablerets , and one of the four distinct and glaciated massifs of the Bernese Alps that lie between the Rhone elbow and the Gemmi Pass . The normal route to the summit starts from the Rambert Hut ( 2,582 m ) , above Ovronnaz .",

With an elevation of 3,037 metres above sea level , the T\u00eate Ronde is the highest summit entirely within the canton of Vaud . Within the Diablerets massif , two summits that form part of the canton 's border , the Diableret summit directly to the east and Oldenhorn peak , a short distance to the northeast , are both higher than the T\u00eate Ronde .",
  "/wiki/Scex_Rouge": "The Scex Rouge ( also spelled Sex Rouge ; lit . red rock ; 2,971 m ) is a mountain of the Alps , overlooking Les Diablerets in the canton of Vaud . Along with the Oldenhorn to the east , it is one of the main peaks of the Diablerets , a huge ice-covered mountain near the western end of the Bernese Alps , straddling the border between the cantons of Vaud , Valais and Bern , and exceeding 3,000 metres above sea level . On its west side , the Scex Rouge is part of a nearly 2,000 metre-high amphitheatre of cliffs surrounding the Creux de Champ valley , south of Les Diablerets . On its southeast side , the Scex Rouge overlooks the Tsanfleuron Glacier , the largest in the massif . Administratively , the mountain is part of the municipality of Ormont-Dessus , which also includes Les Diablerets . The Scex Rouge is connected from the Col du Pillon ( Vaud ) by two aerial tramways and from Reusch ( Bern ) by three , all operated by Glacier 3000 . The first leads to the summit of the T\u00eate aux Chamois ( 2,525 m ) , which can also be reached from Reusch and Oldenegg on the Bernese side . From the T\u00eate aux Chamois , the highest aerial tramway leads to near the summit of the Scex Rouge , or more precisely , a 2,965 metre-high subsidiary summit . The mountain station lies at an elevation of 2,940 metres and consists of a large building , designed by Mario Botta , including a panoramic restaurant . The true summit of the Scex Rouge can only be reached by a bridge connecting it with the subsidiary peak , which is in turn connected to the station by stairs . The 107 metre-long so-called suspension bridge ( without towers ) , called Peak Walk , is the world 's first suspension bridge which connects two mountain peaks .",

Its position at the end of this chain of mountains and the abrupt drop to the wide valley of the Rhone river below make the Dent de Morcles prominently visible from many points in Lausanne and other populated areas on the north and northeastern shores of Lake Geneva .
