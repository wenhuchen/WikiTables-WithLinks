It is on the eastern end of Lake Ontario , at the beginning of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River ( south end of the Rideau Canal ) . The city is midway between Toronto , Ontario and Montreal , Quebec . The Thousand Islands tourist region is nearby to the east . Kingston is nicknamed the Limestone City because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone . Growing European exploration in the 17th century , and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade , led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as Cataraqui ( generally pronounced kah-tah-ROCK-way ) in 1673 . This outpost , called Fort Cataraqui , and later Fort Frontenac , became a focus for settlement . Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort , and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s . Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10 , 1841 . While its time as a capital city was short ( ending in 1844 ) , the community has remained an important military installation . Kingston was the county seat of Frontenac County until 1998 . Kingston is now a separate municipality from the County of Frontenac .",

The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province .

Well known for its members ' face paint and stage outfits , the group rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1970s with their elaborate live performances , which featured fire breathing , blood-spitting , smoking guitars , shooting rockets , levitating drum kits , and pyrotechnics . The band has gone through several lineup changes , with Stanley and Simmons being the only members to feature in every lineup . The original and best-known lineup consisted of Stanley ( vocals and rhythm guitar ) , Simmons ( vocals and bass ) , Frehley ( lead guitar and vocals ) , and Criss ( drums and vocals ) . With their make-up and costumes , they took on the personae of comic book-style characters : the Starchild ( Stanley ) , the Demon ( Simmons ) , the Spaceman or Space Ace ( Frehley ) , and the Catman ( Criss ) . Due to creative differences , both Criss and Frehley had departed the group by 1982 . In 1983 , Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes , thus marking the beginning of the band 's unmasked era that would last for over a decade . They accordingly experienced a commercial resurgence , with the platinum certified album Lick It Up successfully introducing them to a new generation of fans , and their music videos received regular airplay on MTV . Eric Carr , who had replaced Criss in 1980 , died in 1991 of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer . In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s , the original lineup re-united in 1996 , which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes . The resulting Alive/Worldwide Tour was highly successful , grossing $ 143.7 million , making it their most successful tour to date .

In contrast , a fully automatic rifle both cycles the cartridges and cycles ( resets and releases ) the hammer/striker automatically ( the trigger merely keeps the sear disengaged ) .

  "/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre": "The Columbine High School massacre was a school shooting and attempted bombing that occurred on April 20 , 1999 , at Columbine High School in Columbine , Colorado , United States . [ n 2 ] The perpetrators , twelfth grade ( senior ) students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold , murdered 12 students and one teacher . Ten students were killed in the school library , where the pair subsequently committed suicide . 21 additional people were injured with gunshots and gunfire was also exchanged with the police . Another three people were injured trying to escape the school . At the time , it was the deadliest school shooting in United States history . [ n 3 ] The crime has inspired several copycats ( see Columbine effect ) and Columbine has become a byword for mass shootings . In addition to the shootings , the attack involved several homemade bombs . Two of these were placed in the cafeteria , powerful enough to kill or seriously injure all people within the area , although they failed to detonate . Their cars in the parking lots were made into bombs which also failed to detonate , and at another location away from the school , two bombs were set up as diversions , only one of which partially detonated . The motive remains unclear ; but the pair planned the massacre for around a year , and hoped the massacre would cause the most deaths in United States history , which then meant exceeding the death toll of the Oklahoma City bombing , which occurred four years earlier in 1995 . USA Today referred to the attack as planned as a grand , if badly implemented , terrorist bombing .",
