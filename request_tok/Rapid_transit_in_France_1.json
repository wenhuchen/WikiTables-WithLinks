Not including the metropolitan area , Angers is the third most populous commune in northwestern France after Nantes and Rennes and the 17th in France . For centuries , Angers was an important stronghold in northwestern France . It was the cradle of the Plantagenet dynasty and became one of the intellectual centers of Europe during the reign of Ren\u00e9 of Anjou . Angers developed at the confluence of three rivers , the Mayenne , the Sarthe , and the Loir , all coming from the north and flowing south to the Loire . Their confluence , just north of Angers , creates the Maine , a short but wide river that flows into the Loire several kilometres south . The Angers metropolitan area is a major economic centre in western France , particularly active in industry , horticulture , and tourism . Angers proper covers 42.70 square kilometers ( 16.5 sq mi ) and has a population of 147,305 inhabitants , while around 394,700 live in its metropolitan area . The Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole is made up of 30 communes covering 540 square kilometers ( 208 square miles ) with 287,000 inhabitants .

  "/wiki/Tram": "A tram ( in North America streetcar or trolley ) is a rail vehicle that runs on tramway tracks along public urban streets ; some include segments of segregated right-of-way . The lines or networks operated by tramcars are called tramways . Historically the term electric street railways was also used in the United States . In the United States , the term tram has sometimes been used for rubber-tired trackless trains , which are unrelated to other kinds of trams . Tram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than main line and rapid transit trains . Today , most trams use electrical power , usually fed by a pantograph sliding on an overhead line ; older systems may use a trolley pole or a bow collector . In some cases by a contact shoe on a third rail is used . If necessary , they may have dual power systems - electricity in city streets , and diesel in more rural environments . Occasionally , trams also carry freight . Trams are now commonly included in the wider term light rail , which also includes grade-separated systems . Some trams , known as tram-trains , may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks , similar to interurban systems . The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct , and a given system may combine multiple features .",

The entire passenger line was guided , and in normal service the vehicles are powered by electricity drawn from an overhead wire through a pantograph . The vehicles had auxiliary diesel engines and steering wheels and were able to operate away from the guide rail , but only in diesel mode , and under normal operating conditions they ran only in electric mode when carrying passengers along the route , using their diesel engines only when travelling to and from the depot ( garage ) . The use of pantographs for current collection meant the Caen vehicles could not move laterally away from the overhead wire when operating in electric mode , and for this reason they were not considered to be trolleybuses , under the English language meaning of that word , and the system is sometimes referred to as a rubber-tyred tramway .",

As of 2018 , only the Nancy system is in operation ; the Caen system has been abandoned and now rebuilt as a conventional tramway by 2019 . Both of the systems in these cities are referred to as tramways on tyres , and in common with tram systems they use a surface guidance system and in normal operation are powered by electricity drawn from an overhead wire . However , while the vehicles are guided by a central guidance rail , they ride on rubber tyres , not on rails . There has been disagreement about whether they should be called trams , for that reason and also because they are capable of being steered and operating independently of the guidance rail , using auxiliary diesel engines . GLT is effectively a model of guided dual-mode bus , but when GLT vehicles use a pantograph to collect current , as do those in Caen , they are not commonly considered to be trolleybuses . English transport publications generally refer to the GLT and the competing Translohr system as rubber-tyred tramways , but rarely simply as tramways , as they are not tramways in the conventional sense , but neither are they buses when pantograph-equipped and operating in service as designed ( i.e . in electric mode ) . GLT is one of the few models ( together with the Innovia APM ) of rubber-tyred vehicles produced by Bombardier 's transport division , which is otherwise focused on rail transport .",

The project included building 8.5 kilometres ( 5.3 mi ) of new tracks , while the remainder of the route runs along the existing T3 tram line , on which passing tracks were built in some stations to allow express service . The service is independently run and is not a part of the TCL system , although it appears on TCL maps .

  "/wiki/Interurban": "The interurban ( or radial railway ) is a type of electric railway , with streetcar-like light electric self-propelled railcars which run within and between cities or towns . They were prevalent in North America between 1900 and 1925 and were used primarily for passenger travel between cities and their surrounding suburban and rural communities . Large networks have also been built in countries such as Japan , the Netherlands , Belgium and Poland , many of which survive to the present day . Interurban as a term encompassed the companies , their infrastructure , and the cars that ran on the rails . The interurban , especially in the United States , was a valuable cultural institution . Most roads and town streets were unpaved , and transportation was by horse-drawn carriages and carts . The interurban provided vital transportation links between the city and countryside . In 1915 , 15,500 miles ( 24,900 km ) of interurban railways were operating in the United States . For a time , interurban railways were the fifth-largest industry in the United States . By 1930 , most interurbans in North America were gone , with few surviving into the 1950s . Oliver Jensen , author of American Heritage History of Railroads in America , commented that .the automobile doomed the interurban whose private tax paying tracks could never compete with the highways that a generous government provided for the motorist .

Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany , Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France . During the 17th century , after the establishment of the French colonial empire , Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the 18th-century French Atlantic slave trade .

There is also a train-tram , which is a train modified to also run on tramlines .
