  "/wiki/Point_guard": "The point guard ( PG ) , also called the one or point , is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game . A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position . Point guards are expected to run the team 's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time . Above all , the point guard must understand and accept their coach 's game plan ; in this way , the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football , a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer ( association football ) . They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game . A point guard , like other player positions in basketball , specializes in certain skills . Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team , or sometimes for themselves . Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor , who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates . This involves setting up plays on the court , getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score , and controlling the tempo of the game . A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets . Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders . A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock , the score , the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams , etc .",
