  "/wiki/Real-time_strategy": "Real-time strategy ( RTS ) is a sub-genre of strategy video games in which the game does not progress incrementally in turns . This is distinguished from turn-based strategy ( TBS ) , in which all players take turns when playing . In an RTS , the participants position and maneuver units and structures under their control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents ' assets . In a typical RTS , it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game . This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources . These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose . More specifically , the typical game of the RTS genre features resource gathering , base building , in-game technological development and indirect control of units . The term real-time strategy was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s . The tasks a player must perform to succeed at an RTS can be very demanding , and complex user interfaces have evolved to cope with the challenge . Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments ; for example , the technique of clicking and dragging to select all units under a given area . Though some game genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template , recognized genres are generally not subsumed as RTS games . For instance , city-building games , construction and management simulations , and games of the real-time tactics variety are generally not considered to be real-time strategy .",

  "/wiki/Super_Mario_(series)": "Super Mario [ a ] is a Japanese platform video game series and media franchise created by Nintendo and featuring their mascot , Mario . Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. [ b ] series or simply the Mario [ c ] series , it is the central series of the greater Mario franchise . At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console . However there have also been a number of Super Mario video games released on non-Nintendo gaming platforms . The Super Mario games follow Mario 's adventures , typically in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom with Mario as the player character . He is often joined by his brother , Luigi , and occasionally by other members of the Mario cast . As in platform video games , the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels . The games have simple plots , typically with Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist , Bowser . The first title in the series , Super Mario Bros. , released for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) in 1985 , established gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every Super Mario game released since . These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give Mario special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing into both giant and miniature sizes .

Clones are typically made to take financial advantage of the popularity of the cloned game or system , but clones may also result from earnest attempts to create homages or expand on gameplay ideas presented in the original game . Legally , video game clones are not generally considered to be copyright infringement as gameplay elements are broadly uncopyrightable , an essential factor for creative development of new games based on past ideas . More recent case law has identified that game developers can protect their games ' look and feel from clones , while methods like patents , trademarks , and industry regulation also help to fend off clones .",
  "/wiki/Portal_(video_game)": "Portal is a 2007 puzzle-platform game developed and published by Valve . It was released in a bundle , The Orange Box , for Windows , Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , and has been since ported to other systems , including Mac OS X , Linux , and Android . Portal consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player 's character and simple objects using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device , a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes . The player-character , Chell , is challenged and taunted by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS ( Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System ) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed . The game 's unique physics allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals , requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers . This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game Narbacular Drop ; many of the team members from the DigiPen Institute of Technology who worked on Narbacular Drop were hired by Valve for the creation of Portal , making it a spiritual successor to the game . Portal was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007 , despite criticisms of its short duration and limited story . The game received praise for its originality , unique gameplay and dark story with a humorous series of dialogue . GLaDOS , voiced by Ellen McLain in the English-language version , received acclaim for her unique characterization , and the end credits song Still Alive , written by Jonathan Coulton for the game , was praised for its original composition and humorous twist . Portal is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time . Excluding Steam download sales , over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release , spawning official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes , as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun . A standalone version , titled Portal : Still Alive , was released on the Xbox Live Arcade service in October 2008 , which added 14 puzzles to the gameplay , and a sequel , Portal 2 , which was released in 2011 , adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode .",

  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries .",

There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up .

The genre 's roots can be traced back to Spacewar ! , one of the earliest computer games , developed in 1962 . The shoot 'em up genre was later established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders , which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978 , and the genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in 1979 . Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s . In the mid-1990s , shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s , and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts , particularly in Japan .
