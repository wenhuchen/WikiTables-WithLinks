Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital . During the Early Medieval period , three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro : Duklja , roughly corresponding to the southern half ; Travunia , the west ; and Rascia proper , the north . In 1042 , archon Stefan Vojislav led a revolt that resulted in the independence of Duklja from the Byzantine Empire and the establishment of the Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty . After being ruled by the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty for two centuries , the independent Principality of Zeta emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries , ruled by the House of Bal\u0161i\u0107 between 1356 and 1421 , and by the House of Crnojevi\u0107 between 1431 and 1498 , when the name Montenegro started being used for the country . After falling under Ottoman rule , Montenegro regained de facto independence in 1697 under the rule of the House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 , first under the theocratic rule of prince-bishops , before being transformed into a secular principality in 1852 . Montenegro 's de jure independence was recognised by the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 , following the Montenegrin-Ottoman War . In 1905 , the country became a kingdom . After World War I , it became part of Yugoslavia .",
