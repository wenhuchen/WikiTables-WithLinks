  "/wiki/Albuquerque_Basin": "The Albuquerque Basin ( or Middle Rio Grande Basin ) is one of the largest and deepest of the structural basins in the Rio Grande rift . It contains the city of Albuquerque , New Mexico . Geologically , the Albuquerque Basin is a half-graben that slopes down towards the east to terminate on the Sandia and Manzano mountains . It has a semi-arid climate , with large areas that count as desert . From Paleo-Indian traces dating back 12,000 years , the climate used to be wetter and more fertile than it is today . The Rio Grande flows through the basin from north to south . Its valley has been irrigated for at least 1,000 years . Intense irrigation began in the late nineteenth century with new dams , levees and ditches and has caused environmental problems . In times of low water levels in the Rio Grande , Albuquerque relies on groundwater for its potable water supply . The aquifer is composed of deposits from the ancestral Rio Grande and the size of its annual resource follows fluctuations in weather and climate phenomena . There may be natural gas in the basin , but opponents to production fear the impact on the groundwater and on the quality of life .",

The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell ; its name comes from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ( mei\u014dn , less ) and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ( kainos , new ) and means less recent because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene . The Miocene is preceded by the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene . As the earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene , the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages . The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regionally defined boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch . The apes first evolved , arose , and diversified during the early Miocene ( Aquitanian and Burdigalian stages ) , becoming widespread in the Old World . By the end of this epoch and the start of the following one , the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path during the final Messinian stage ( 7.5-5.3 Ma ) of the Miocene . As in the Oligocene before it , grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent . In the seas of the Miocene , kelp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of Earth 's most productive ecosystems . The plants and animals of the Miocene were recognizably modern . Mammals and birds were well-established . Whales , pinnipeds , and kelp spread .",

It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era . The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch . Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale , which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene , the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage , which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago , and is now included in the Pleistocene . As with other older geologic periods , the geological strata that define the start and end are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain . The boundaries defining the Pliocene are not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer Miocene and the relatively cooler Pliocene . The upper boundary was set at the start of the Pleistocene glaciations .",

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

  "/wiki/Cheshire_Basin": "The Cheshire Basin is a late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary basin extending under most of the county of Cheshire in northwest England . It extends northwards into the Manchester area and south into Shropshire . The basin possesses something of the character of a half-graben as its deepest extent is along its eastern and southeastern margins , where it is well defined by a series of sub-parallel faults , most important of which is the Red Rock Fault . These faults divide the basin from the older Carboniferous rocks of the Peak District and the North Staffordshire Coalfield . In terms of its architecture , the basin is sometimes considered to be divided into two sub-basins : the more southerly Wem-Audlem Sub-basin and the Sandbach-Knutsford Sub-basin to its northeast . The basin fill is mainly Permian and Triassic sandstones and mudstones , but it also incorporates economically important halite beds . The sequences referred to the Sherwood Sandstone Group and the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group are the thickest in England . An isolated outlier of Jurassic rocks occurs within the basin at Prees in north Shropshire . The basin is just one part of a wider complex of basins that includes the Worcester Basin , the Stafford Basin and the East Irish Sea Basin . These basins developed while the crust of this region was experiencing east-west tension during the Permian period . It is traversed by a series of largely north-south aligned normal faults , some of which help to define the Mid Cheshire Ridge and Alderley Edge , two upstanding areas within the Cheshire Plain .",

The Paleozoic comes after the Neoproterozoic Era of the Proterozoic Eon and is followed by the Mesozoic Era . The Paleozoic was a time of dramatic geological , climatic , and evolutionary change . The Cambrian witnessed the most rapid and widespread diversification of life in Earth 's history , known as the Cambrian explosion , in which most modern phyla first appeared . Arthropods , molluscs , fish , amphibians , synapsids and diapsids all evolved during the Paleozoic . Life began in the ocean but eventually transitioned onto land , and by the late Paleozoic , it was dominated by various forms of organisms . Great forests of primitive plants covered the continents , many of which formed the coal beds of Europe and eastern North America . Towards the end of the era , large , sophisticated diapsids and synapsids were dominant and the first modern plants ( conifers ) appeared . The Paleozoic Era ended with the largest extinction event in the history of Earth , the Permian-Triassic extinction event . The effects of this catastrophe were so devastating that it took life on land 30 million years into the Mesozoic Era to recover . Recovery of life in the sea may have been much faster .",

The era is subdivided into three major periods : the Triassic , Jurassic , and Cretaceous , which are further subdivided into a number of epochs and stages . The era began in the wake of the Permian-Triassic extinction event , the largest well-documented mass extinction in Earth 's history , and ended with the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event , another mass extinction whose victims included the non-avian dinosaurs . The Mesozoic was a time of significant tectonic , climate , and evolutionary activity . The era witnessed the gradual rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate landmasses that would move into their current positions during the next era . The climate of the Mesozoic was varied , alternating between warming and cooling periods . Overall , however , the Earth was hotter than it is today . Dinosaurs first appeared in the Mid-Triassic , and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates in the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic , occupying this position for about 150 or 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous . Birds first appeared in the Jurassic ( however , true toothless birds appeared first in the Cretaceous ) , having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs . The first mammals also appeared during the Mesozoic , but would remain small - less than 15 kg ( 33 lb ) - until the Cenozoic .",

The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation .

It is the last period of the Paleozoic era ; the following Triassic period belongs to the Mesozoic era . The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison , who named it after the region of Perm in Russia . The Permian witnessed the diversification of the early amniotes into the ancestral groups of the mammals , turtles , lepidosaurs , and archosaurs . The world at the time was dominated by two continents known as Pangaea and Siberia , surrounded by a global ocean called Panthalassa . The Carboniferous rainforest collapse left behind vast regions of desert within the continental interior . Amniotes , which could better cope with these drier conditions , rose to dominance in place of their amphibian ancestors . The Permian ( along with the Paleozoic ) ended with the Permian-Triassic extinction event , the largest mass extinction in Earth 's history , in which nearly 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species died out . It would take well into the Triassic for life to recover from this catastrophe .

South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century .

The Triassic is the first and shortest period of the Mesozoic Era . Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events . The Triassic period is subdivided into three epochs : Early Triassic , Middle Triassic and Late Triassic . Triassic began in the wake of the Permian-Triassic extinction event , which left the Earth 's biosphere impoverished ; it was well into the middle of the Triassic before life recovered its former diversity . Therapsids and archosaurs were the chief terrestrial vertebrates during this time . A specialized subgroup of archosaurs , called dinosaurs , first appeared in the Late Triassic but did not become dominant until the succeeding Jurassic Period . The first true mammals , themselves a specialized subgroup of therapsids , also evolved during this period , as well as the first flying vertebrates , the pterosaurs , who , like the dinosaurs , were a specialized subgroup of archosaurs . The vast supercontinent of Pangaea existed until the mid-Triassic , after which it began to gradually rift into two separate landmasses , Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south . The global climate during the Triassic was mostly hot and dry , with deserts spanning much of Pangaea 's interior . However , the climate shifted and became more humid as Pangaea began to drift apart . The end of the period was marked by yet another major mass extinction , the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event , that wiped out many groups and allowed dinosaurs to assume dominance in the Jurassic .",

[ note 1 ] The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era , also known as the Age of Reptiles . The start of the period was marked by the major Triassic-Jurassic extinction event . Two other extinction events occurred during the period : the Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction in the Early Jurassic , and the Tithonian event at the end ; neither event ranks among the Big Five mass extinctions , however . The Jurassic period is divided into three epochs : Early , Middle , and Late . Similarly , in stratigraphy , the Jurassic is divided into the Lower Jurassic , Middle Jurassic , and Upper Jurassic series of rock formations . The Jurassic is named after the Jura Mountains within the European Alps , where limestone strata from the period were first identified . By the beginning of the Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea had begun rifting into two landmasses : Laurasia to the north , and Gondwana to the south . This created more coastlines and shifted the continental climate from dry to humid , and many of the arid deserts of the Triassic were replaced by lush rainforests . On land , the fauna transitioned from the Triassic fauna , dominated by both dinosauromorph and crocodylomorph archosaurs , to one dominated by dinosaurs alone . The first birds also appeared during the Jurassic , having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs . Other major events include the appearance of the earliest lizards , and the evolution of therian mammals , including primitive placentals .",

Early in the Cenozoic , following the K-Pg extinction event , most of the fauna was relatively small , and included small mammals , birds , reptiles , and amphibians . From a geological perspective , it did not take long for mammals and birds to greatly diversify in the absence of the large reptiles that had dominated during the Mesozoic . A group of avians known as the terror birds grew larger than the average human and were formidable predators . Mammals came to occupy almost every available niche ( both marine and terrestrial ) , and some also grew very large , attaining sizes not seen in most of today 's mammals .

Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory , 58% of its population , and 32% of ethnic Hungarians .",
  "/wiki/Saint_Lawrence_rift_system": "The Saint Lawrence rift system is a seismically active zone paralleling the Saint Lawrence River . The rift system trends northeast and southwest and forms a half-graben that links the Ottawa-Bonnechere and the Saguenay grabens . The rift system extends more than 1,000 km ( 620 mi ) along the Saint Lawrence valley from the Ottawa - Montreal area . Within the system , fault reactivation is believed to occur along late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic normal faults related to the opening of the Iapetus Ocean . Two significant historically active seismic zones occur along this system associated with northwest trending intersecting graben structures . The Charlevoix region has been the location of at least five magnitude six or larger earthquakes over the last 350 years , including the 1925 Charlevoix-Kamouraska earthquake . At the Lower St Lawrence zone the largest recorded earthquakes are about magnitude five . Seismic studies indicate a crustal convergence across the Saint Lawrence valley of about 0.5 mm ( 0.020 in ) per year . The earthquakes of the Charlevoix Seismic Zone are thought to be related to the re-activation of ancient fault structures by the Charlevoix impact event .",
  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

It is the second largest basin in Taiwan . The basin is bounded by Yangmingshan to the north , Linkou mesa to the west , and the Ridge of Xueshan Range to the southeast . The shape of the basin is close to a triangle . The three vertices are Nangang , Huilong of Xinzhuang , and Guandu of Beitou . The main rivers in the Taipei Basin include the Tamsui , Keelung , Dahan and Xindian . In the prehistoric era , the Taipei Basin was home to Ketagalan tribes . Han Chinese did not settle in the region until the 18th century . Today , Taipei Basin is within the boundaries of Taipei City and New Taipei City and is the largest metropolitan area in Taiwan .",
  "/wiki/Taiwan": "Taiwan ( Chinese : \u81fa\u7063 ; pinyin : T\u00e1iw\u0101n ) , [ II ] officially the Republic of China ( ROC ) , [ I ] is a state in East Asia . Neighbouring states include the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) to the north-west , Japan to the north-east , and the Philippines to the south . The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres ( 13,826 sq mi ) , with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third , where its highly urbanised population is concentrated . Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",

It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779 km2 ( 8,023 sq mi ) . Wales has over 1,680 miles ( 2,700 km ) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .",
  "/wiki/Widmerpool_Gulf": "The Widmerpool Gulf is a name given to a sedimentary basin that existed as an area of open water during the Early Carboniferous ( Tournaisian Age ) . It is named after Widmerpool , near Nottingham and was an extension eastwards as far as Lincolnshire , of the North Staffordshire Gulf . It was formed during a rifting event , which began in the Late Devonian , that affected the area between the London-Brabant Massif to the south and the Highland Boundary Fault to the north . It has a large normal fault on its southern margin and has the form of a half-graben . In time , the equatorial swamp forests on its shores were converted into the coalfields of Leicestershire , to the south and Nottinghamshire , to the north .",
  "/wiki/Carboniferous": "The Carboniferous ( /\u02cck\u0251\u02d0r.b\u0259\u02c8n\u026af.\u0259r.\u0259s/ KAHR-b\u0259-NIF-\u0259r-\u0259s ) is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period 358.9 million years ago ( Mya ) , to the beginning of the Permian Period , 298.9 Mya . The name Carboniferous means coal-bearing and derives from the Latin words carb\u014d ( coal ) and fer\u014d ( I bear , I carry ) , and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822 . Based on a study of the British rock succession , it was the first of the modern 'system ' names to be employed , and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time . The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods , the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian . Terrestrial animal life was well established by the Carboniferous period . Amphibians were the dominant land vertebrates , of which one branch would eventually evolve into amniotes , the first solely terrestrial vertebrates . Arthropods were also very common , and many ( such as Meganeura ) were much larger than those of today . Vast swaths of forest covered the land , which would eventually be laid down and become the coal beds characteristic of the Carboniferous stratigraphy evident today . The atmospheric content of oxygen also reached its highest levels in geological history during the period , 35% compared with 21% today , allowing terrestrial invertebrates to evolve to great size . The later half of the period experienced glaciations , low sea level , and mountain building as the continents collided to form Pangaea . A minor marine and terrestrial extinction event , the Carboniferous rainforest collapse , occurred at the end of the period , caused by climate change ."
