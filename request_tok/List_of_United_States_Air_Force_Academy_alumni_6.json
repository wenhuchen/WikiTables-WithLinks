Flights began in April 2000 , but were suspended indefinitely in December 2000 due to mounting losses , with the airline filing for bankruptcy . Efforts to secure additional financing and restart flights came to naught ; the airline surrendered its operating certificate and was liquidated in mid-2001 .

  "/wiki/Ronald_Reagan": "Ronald Wilson Reagan ( /\u02c8re\u026a\u0261\u0259n/ ; February 6 , 1911 - June 5 , 2004 ) was an American politician who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989 and became a highly influential voice of modern conservatism . Prior to his presidency , he was a Hollywood actor and union leader before serving as the 33rd governor of California from 1967 to 1975 . Reagan was raised in a low-income family in small towns of northern Illinois . He graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a sports commentator on several regional radio stations . After moving to California in 1937 , he found work as an actor and starred in a few major productions . Reagan was twice elected president of the Screen Actors Guild - the labor union for actors - where he worked to root out Communist influence . In the 1950s , he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories , during which time he became a conservative . Reagan was a Democrat until 1962 when he switched to the Republican Party . In 1964 , Reagan 's speech A Time for Choosing supported Barry Goldwater 's foundering presidential campaign and earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman . Building a network of supporters , Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966 . As governor , Reagan raised taxes , turned a state budget deficit to a surplus , challenged the protesters at the University of California , ordered in National Guard troops during a period of protest movements in 1969 , and was re-elected in 1970 .

  "/wiki/Iran-Contra_affair": "The Iran-Contra affair ( Persian : \u0645\u0627\u062c\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646-\u06a9\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0627 , Spanish : Caso Ir\u00e1n-Contra ) , popularized in Iran as the McFarlane affair , the Iran-Contra scandal , or simply Iran-Contra , was a political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term of the Reagan Administration . Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to the Khomeini government of the Islamic Republic of Iran , which was the subject of an arms embargo . The administration hoped to use the proceeds of the arms sale to fund the Contras in Nicaragua . Under the Boland Amendment , further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress . The official justification for the arms shipments was that they were part of an operation to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah , a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps . The plan was for Israel to ship weapons to Iran , for the United States to resupply Israel , and for Israel to pay the United States . The Iranian recipients promised to do everything in their power to achieve the release of the hostages . The first arms sales authorized to Iran were in 1981 , prior to the American hostages having been taken in Lebanon . The plan was later complicated in late 1985 , when Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council diverted a portion of the proceeds from the Iranian weapon sales to fund the Contras , a group of anti-Sandinista rebels , in their insurgency against the socialist government of Nicaragua . While President Ronald Reagan was a vocal supporter of the Contra cause , the evidence is disputed as to whether he personally authorized the diversion of funds to the Contras . Handwritten notes taken by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on 7 December 1985 indicate that Reagan was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran , as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to moderate elements within that country . Weinberger wrote that Reagan said he could answer to charges of illegality but could n't answer to the charge that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free the hostages . '",
  "/wiki/General_Counsel": "A general counsel , chief counsel , or chief legal officer ( CLO ) is the chief lawyer of a legal department , usually in a company or a governmental department . In a company , the person holding the position typically reports directly to the CEO , and their duties involve overseeing and identifying the legal issues in all departments and their interrelation , including engineering , design , marketing , sales , distribution , credit , finance , human resources and production , as well as corporate governance and business policy . This would naturally require in most cases reporting directly to the owner or CEO overseeing the very business on which the CLO is expected to be familiar with and advise on the most confidential level . This requires the CLO/general counsel to work closely with each of the other officers , and their departments , to appropriately be aware and advise . Historically , general counsel often handled administrative tasks while outside lawyers in private practice handled more complex legal work . Since the 1980s , however , the general counsel position has become increasingly prominent in multinational companies , often directly advising the board of directors in place of outside lawyers . General counsel are now often among the most highly paid executives of major American corporations , and prominent American government lawyers and law firm partners are often hired for general counsel roles at prominent companies . Similar trends are also being seen in the United Kingdom and other countries . General counsel often have broad roles encompassing crisis management , compliance reporting management and public policy advocacy . Many companies also hire in-house counsel to handle specialized tasks such as tax work , mergers and acquisitions , labor law and intellectual property , sometimes building in-house practice groups that rival the practices of major law firms .",

It entered service in 1976 and is the only production-built aircraft that has served in the USAF that was designed solely for CAS . Its secondary mission is to provide forward air controller - airborne support , by directing other aircraft in attacks on ground targets . Aircraft used primarily in this role are designated OA-10 . The A-10 was intended to improve on the performance of the A-1 Skyraider and its lesser firepower . The A-10 was designed around the 30 mm GAU-8 Avenger rotary cannon . Its airframe was designed for durability , with measures such as 1,200 pounds ( 540 kg ) of titanium armor to protect the cockpit and aircraft systems , enabling it to absorb a significant amount of damage and continue flying . Its short takeoff and landing capability permits operation from airstrips close to the front lines , and its simple design enables maintenance with minimal facilities . The A-10 served in the Gulf War ( Operation Desert Storm ) , the American led intervention against Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , where the A-10 distinguished itself . The A-10 also participated in other conflicts such as in Grenada , the Balkans , Afghanistan , Iraq , and against Islamic State in the Middle East ."
