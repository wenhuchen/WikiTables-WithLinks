In 1957 , the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding performance at each position . The award was created from a glove made from gold lam\u00e9-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base . Initially , only one Gold Glove per position was awarded to the top fielder at each position in the entire major league ; however , separate awards were given for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958 . The phrase at each position was not strictly accurate until 2011 , when the awards were changed to specify individual awards for left fielder , center fielder , and right fielder . Previously , the prize was presented to three outfielders irrespective of their specific position . Any combination of outfielders , often three center fielders , could win the award in the same year . Critics called for awarding a single Gold Glove for each individual outfield position , arguing that the three outfield positions are not equivalent defensively . In the 1985 American League voting , a tie for third-place resulted in the presentation of Gold Glove Awards to four outfielders ( Dwayne Murphy , Gary Pettis , Dwight Evans and Dave Winfield ) ; this scenario was repeated in the National League in 2007 ( Andruw Jones , Carlos Beltr\u00e1n , Aaron Rowand , and Jeff Francoeur ) . Father and son Bobby and Barry Bonds are the only family pair who have won Gold Glove Awards as outfielders .",

  "/wiki/Mickey_Mantle": "Mickey Charles Mantle ( October 20 , 1931 - August 13 , 1995 ) , nicknamed The Commerce Comet and The Mick , was an American professional baseball player . Mantle played his entire Major League Baseball ( MLB ) career ( 1951-1968 ) with the New York Yankees as a center fielder , right fielder , and first baseman . Mantle was one of the best players and sluggers and is regarded by many as the greatest switch hitter in baseball history . Mantle was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999 . Mantle was one of the greatest offensive threats of any center fielder in baseball history . He has the highest career OPS+ of any center fielder , and he had the highest stolen base percentage in history at the time of his retirement . In addition , compared to the other four center fielders on the All-Century team , he had the lowest career rate of grounding into double plays , and he had the highest World Series on-base percentage and World Series slugging percentage . He also had an excellent 0.984 fielding percentage when playing center field . Mantle was noted for his ability to hit for both average and power , especially tape measure home runs , a term that was originated by a play-by-play caller reacting to one of Mantle 's 1953 home runs . He hit 536 MLB career home runs , batted .300 or more ten times , and is the career leader ( tied with Jim Thome ) in walk-off home runs , with thirteen - twelve in the regular season and one in the postseason . Mantle is 16th all-time in Home runs per at bats . He is 18th in on-base percentage .",
  "/wiki/Roger_Maris": "Roger Eugene Maris ( September 10 , 1934 - December 14 , 1985 ) was an American professional baseball right fielder . He is best known for setting a new Major League Baseball single-season home run record with 61 home runs in 1961 ; the record remained unbroken until 1998 . Maris played in the minor leagues from 1953 to 1956 , and in the major leagues from 1957 to 1968 . He reached the major leagues in 1957 as a player for the Cleveland Indians . He was traded to the Kansas City Athletics during the 1958 season , and to the New York Yankees after the 1959 season . Maris finished his playing career as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1967 and 1968 . Maris was an American League ( AL ) All-Star from 1959 through 1962 , [ a ] an AL Most Valuable Player in 1960 and 1961 , and an AL Gold Glove Award winner in 1960 . Maris appeared in seven World Series ; he played for Yankees teams that won the World Series in 1961 and 1962 and for a Cardinals team that won the World Series in 1967 . Maris ' home run record was controversial . The previous single-season home run record ( 60 , set by Babe Ruth in 1927 ) was set during a period when Major League Baseball teams played 154 games per season . Before Maris broke Ruth 's record , the American League baseball season had been extended to 162 games . Maris hit his 61st home run in the very last game of the season , which led to questions about the legitimacy of his record ."
