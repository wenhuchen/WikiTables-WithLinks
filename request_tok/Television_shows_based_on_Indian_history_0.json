  "/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857": "The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major , but ultimately unsuccessful , uprising in India in 1857-58 against the rule of the British East India Company , which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown . The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company 's army in the garrison town of Meerut , 40 mi ( 64 km ) northeast of Delhi ( now Old Delhi ) . It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India , [ a ] [ b ] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east . [ c ] The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region , [ d ] and was contained only with the rebels ' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858 . On 1 November 1858 , the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder , though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859 . Its name is contested , variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny , the Indian Mutiny , the Great Rebellion , the Revolt of 1857 , the Indian Insurrection , and the First War of Independence . [ e ] The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions , including invasive British-style social reforms , harsh land taxes , summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes , as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule . [ f ] Many Indians rose against the British ; however , many also fought for the British , and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule . [ g ] Violence , which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty , was inflicted on both sides , on British officers , and civilians , including women and children , by the rebels , and on the rebels , and their supporters , including sometimes entire villages , by British reprisals ; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation . [ h ] After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut , the rebels quickly reached Delhi , whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler , Bahadur Shah Zafar , was declared the Emperor of Hindustan . Soon , the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh ( Oudh ) . The East India Company 's response came rapidly as well .",

ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK . Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990 , its legal name has been Channel 3 , to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time , namely BBC 1 , BBC 2 and Channel 4 . In part , the number 3 was assigned because television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button , with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name . ITV is a network of television companies that operate regional television services and also share programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network . In recent years , several of these companies have merged , so currently the fifteen regional franchises are in the hands of two companies . The ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc , the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England , Wales , southern Scotland , the Isle of Man , the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland . With the exception of Northern Ireland , the ITV brand is the brand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas . In Northern Ireland , ITV plc uses the brand name UTV .

  "/wiki/Mughal_Empire": "The Mughal Empire or Mogul Empire , was an early-modern empire in South Asia . For some two centuries , the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus basin in the west , northern Afghanistan in the northwest , and Kashmir in the north , to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east , and the uplands of the Deccan plateau in South India . The Mughal empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur , a warrior chieftain from what today is Uzbekistan , who employed aid from the neighboring Safavid- and Ottoman empires , to defeat the Sultan of Delhi , Ibrahim Lodhi , in the First Battle of Panipat , and to sweep down the plains of Upper India . The Mughal imperial structure , however , is sometimes dated to 1600 , to the rule of Babur 's grandson , Akbar , This imperial structure lasted until 1720 , until shortly after the death of the last major emperor , Aurengzeb , during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent . Reduced subsequently , especially during the East India Company rule in India , to the region in and around Old Delhi , the empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . Although the Mughal empire was created and sustained by military warfare , it did not vigorously suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule , but rather equalized and placated them through new administrative practices , and diverse ruling elites , leading to more efficient , centralised , and standardized rule . The base of the empire 's collective wealth was agricultural taxes , instituted by the third Mughal emperor , Akbar . These taxes , which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator , were paid in the well-regulated silver currency , and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets . The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India 's economic expansion . Burgeoning European presence in the Indian ocean , and its increasing demand for Indian raw- and finished products , created still greater wealth in the Mughal courts . There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite , resulting in greater patronage of painting , literary forms , textiles , and architecture , especially during the reign of Shah Jahan . Among the Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Asia are : Agra Fort , Fatehpur Sikri , Red Fort , Humayun 's Tomb , Lahore Fort and the Taj Mahal , which is described as , The jewel of Muslim art in India , and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world 's heritage .",

  "/wiki/History_of_India": "Anatomically modern humans are thought to have arrived on the Indian subcontinent between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago . Settled life , which involves the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism , began in South Asia around 7,000 BCE ; during this period , domestication of wheat and barley , rapidly followed by that of goats , sheep , and cattle occurred . By 4,500 BCE , settled life had become more widely prevalent , and eventually evolved into the Indus Valley Civilization . Considered a cradle of civilisation , the Indus Valley civilisation , which spread and flourished in the north-western part of the Indian subcontinent from 3300 to 1300 BCE , was the first major civilisation in South Asia . A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature Harappan period , from 2600 to 1900 BCE . Indus Valley Civilisation was noted for developing new techniques in handicraft , carnelian products , seal carving , metallurgy , urban planning , baked brick houses , efficient drainage systems , water supply systems and clusters of large non-residential buildings . This civilisation collapsed at the start of the second millennium BCE and was later followed by the Iron Age Vedic Period . In early second millennium BCE persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban centres to villages . Around the same time , Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from regions further northwest in several waves of migration . The resulting Vedic period was marked by the composition of the Vedas , large collections of hymns of these tribes whose postulated religious culture , through synthesis with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent , gave rise to Hinduism . The caste system , which created a hierarchy of priests , warriors , and free peasants arose later during this period . Towards the end of the period , around 600 BCE , after the pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain , large swaths of which they deforested to pave way for agriculture , a second urbanisation took place .",

The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty , Chandragupta Maurya , Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia .

The Jayasi text describes her story as follows : Padmavati was an exceptionally beautiful princess of the Singhal kingdom ( Sri Lanka ) . Ratan Sen , the Rajput ruler of Chittor Fort , heard about her beauty from a talking parrot named Hiraman . After an adventurous quest , he won her hand in marriage and brought her to Chittor . Ratan Sen was captured and imprisoned by Alauddin Khalji , the Sultan of Delhi . While Ratan Sen was in prison , the king of Kumbhalner Devpal became enamoured with Padmavati 's beauty and proposed to marry her . Ratan Sen returned to Chittor and entered into a duel with Devpal , in which both died . Alauddin Khalji laid siege to Chittor to obtain Padmavati . Facing a certain defeat against Khalji , before Chittor was captured , she and her companions committed Jauhar ( self-immolation ) thereby defeating Khalji 's aim and protecting their honour . Coupled to the Jauhar , the Rajput men died fighting on the battlefield . Many other written and oral tradition versions of her life exist in Hindu and Jain traditions .",

According to one of the stories , Anarkali had an illicit relationship with the Crown Prince Jahangir and the Mughal Emperor Akbar had her enclosed in a wall where she died . There is no historic proof of Anarakali 's existence although her character often appears in movies , books and fictionalized versions of history . Anarkali was first mentioned in the journal of an English tourist and trader , William Finch , after he visited the Mughal Empire on 24 August , 1608 . The story was also written by Indian writer Abdul Halim Sharar and on the first page of his book , he clearly mentions it to be a work of fiction . Nevertheless , Anarkali 's story has been adapted into literature , art and cinema . [ citation needed ] She is depicted in the Bollywood movie , Mughal-e-Azam , which is set during the Mughal period . According to legend , Anarkali was ordered to be buried alive between two walls by Mughal Emperor Akbar for having an illicit relationship with the Crown-Prince Salim , later to become Mughal Emperor Jahangir . There is disagreement among scholars concerning the authenticity of Anarkali 's story . There are many supporting and opposing views such as the ones mentioned below . The earliest Western stories about the love affair between Salim and Anarkali were written by two British travellers , William Finch and Edward Terry . William Finch reached Lahore in February 1611 ( only 11 years after the supposed death of Anarkali ) , to sell indigo he had purchased at Bayana on behalf of the East India Company .",

A strong personality and a successful general , Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include most of the Indian subcontinent . His power and influence , however , extended over the entire subcontinent because of Mughal military , political , cultural , and economic dominance .

To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire , he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects . Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity , Akbar strove to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty , expressed through an Indo-Persian culture , to himself as an emperor .
