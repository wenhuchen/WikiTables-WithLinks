  "/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate": "The following are lists of countries by suicide rate according to data from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and other sources . A country 's rate is determined by its age-adjusted total rate ( per 100,000 population ) of deaths officially recorded as suicides in the most recent available year . About one person in 5,000-15,000 dies by suicide every year ( 1.4% of all deaths ) , with a reported global rate of 10.5 per 100,000 population in 2016 ( down from 11.6 in 2008 ) . In high-income countries , male and female rates of suicidal behaviors differ at a greater degree compared to those in the rest of the world : even though women are more prone to suicidal thoughts , rates of suicide are higher among men . Europe is the most suicidal region in the entire world , while the Eastern Mediterranean the least . According to a recent study , the global rates of suicide death have fallen by a third between 1990 and 2016 when data is asymmetrically adjusted for age , meaning younger people suicided less , vice versa with regards to adults ( total number of deaths from suicide actually increased by 6.7% , from 762,000 to 817,000 annually ) . Also , at the national level , rates of suicide mortality for women were lower than those for men in all countries ( except Liberia ) . Worldwide , the rates were about 16 deaths per 100,000 men and 7 deaths per 100,000 women in 2016 : women also experienced a greater decrease in suicide rates compared with men over the study period . Per recent WHO releases , social stigma , the taboo to openly discuss suicide , and low availability of data lead to poor data quality for both suicide and suicide attempts : given the sensitivity of suicide - and the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries - it is likely that under-reporting and mis-classification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death .",

Cigarettes are smoked by over 1 billion people , which is nearly 20% of the world 's population in 2014 . About 800 million of these smokers are men . While smoking rates have leveled off or declined in developed nations , especially among men , in developing nations tobacco consumption continues to rise . More than 80% of all smokers now live in countries with low or middle incomes , and 60% in just 10 countries , a list headed by China . China is the world 's most populated country , and is also the leading country in the cigarette industry . In 2014 , China produced and consumed more than 30% of the cigarettes in the world . There is a strong relationship between socioeconomic status ( SES ) and smoking behaviors . According to research , developing countries have the highest rate of tobacco use . China was found to be one of the countries with the highest male-to-female ratio of smoking prevalence : 74% of males and 8% of females were smokers . Over half of adult males in Indonesia are smokers ( 57% , but mostly kretek , a local form of cigarette ) and China ( 53% estimated ) , and nearly half in Bangladesh , though for women the figure is much lower . Smoking rates in the United States dropped by half from 1965 to 2006 , from 42% to 20.8% of adults , with further significant decline to 18% by 2012 .",

It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",
  "/wiki/Opium_production_in_Afghanistan": "Afghanistan has been the world 's leading illicit opium producer since 2001 . Afghanistan 's opium poppy harvest produces more than 90% of illicit heroin globally , and more than 95% of the European supply . More land is used for opium in Afghanistan than is used for coca cultivation in Latin America . In 2007 , 93% of the non-pharmaceutical-grade opiates on the world market originated in Afghanistan . This amounts to an export value of about US $ 4 billion , with a quarter being earned by opium farmers and the rest going to district officials , insurgents , warlords , and drug traffickers . In the seven years ( 1994-2000 ) prior to a Taliban opium ban , the Afghan farmers ' share of gross income from opium was divided among 200,000 families . As of 2017 , opium production provides about 400,000 jobs in Afghanistan , more than the Afghan National Security Forces .

  "/wiki/Safe_sex": "Safe sex is sexual activity using methods or devices ( such as condoms ) to reduce the risk of transmitting or acquiring sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) , especially HIV . Safe sex is also sometimes referred to as safer sex or protected sex to indicate that some safe sex practices do not completely eliminate STI risks . It is also sometimes used colloquially to describe methods aimed at preventing pregnancy that may or may not also lower STI risks . The concept of safe sex emerged in the 1980s as a response to the global AIDS epidemic , and possibly more specifically to the AIDS crisis in the US . Promoting safe sex is now one of the main aims of sex education and STI prevention , especially reducing new HIV infections . Safe sex is regarded as a harm reduction strategy aimed at reducing the risk of STI transmission . Although some safe sex practices ( like condoms ) can also be used as birth control ( contraception ) , most forms of contraception do not protect against STIs . Likewise , some safe sex practices , such as partner selection and low-risk sex behavior , [ example needed ] might not be effective forms of contraception .",
  "/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection": "Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) , also referred to as sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) , are infections that are commonly spread by sexual activity , especially vaginal intercourse , anal sex and oral sex . Many times STIs initially do not cause symptoms . This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others . Symptoms and signs of disease may include vaginal discharge , penile discharge , ulcers on or around the genitals , and pelvic pain . STIs can be transmitted to an infant before or during childbirth and may result in poor outcomes for the baby . Some STIs may cause problems with the ability to get pregnant . More than 30 different bacteria , viruses , and parasites can be transmitted through sexual activity . Bacterial STIs include chlamydia , gonorrhea , and syphilis . Viral STIs include genital herpes , HIV/AIDS , and genital warts . Parasitic STIs include trichomoniasis . While usually spread by sex , some STIs can be spread by non-sexual contact with donor tissue , blood , breastfeeding , or during childbirth . STI diagnostic tests are usually easily available in the developed world , but this is often not the case in the developing world .",
  "/wiki/Antiretroviral": "The management of HIV/AIDS normally includes the use of multiple antiretroviral drugs in an attempt to control HIV infection . There are several classes of antiretroviral agents that act on different stages of the HIV life-cycle . The use of multiple drugs that act on different viral targets is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . HAART decreases the patient 's total burden of HIV , maintains function of the immune system , and prevents opportunistic infections that often lead to death . HAART also prevents the transmission of HIV between serodiscordant same sex and opposite sex partners so long as the HIV-positive partner maintains an undetectable viral load . Treatment has been so successful that in many parts of the world , HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare . Anthony Fauci , head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , has written , With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come , an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach . In the same paper , he noted that an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone by antiretroviral therapy . As another commentary in The Lancet noted , Rather than dealing with acute and potentially life-threatening complications , clinicians are now confronted with managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades . The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization recommend offering antiretroviral treatment to all patients with HIV . Because of the complexity of selecting and following a regimen , the potential for side effects , and the importance of taking medications regularly to prevent viral resistance , such organizations emphasize the importance of involving patients in therapy choices and recommend analyzing the risks and the potential benefits . The World Health Organization has defined health as more than the absence of disease .",

  "/wiki/Malnutrition": "Malnutrition is a condition that results from eating a diet in which one or more nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems . It may involve calories , protein , carbohydrates , vitamins or minerals . Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition . Malnutrition is often used to specifically refer to undernutrition where an individual is not getting enough calories , protein , or micronutrients . If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy , or before two years of age , it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development . Extreme undernourishment , known as starvation , may have symptoms that include : a short height , thin body , very poor energy levels , and swollen legs and abdomen . People also often get infections and are frequently cold . The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking . Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat . This is often related to high food prices and poverty . A lack of breastfeeding may contribute , as may a number of infectious diseases such as : gastroenteritis , pneumonia , malaria , and measles , which increase nutrient requirements . There are two main types of undernutrition : protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies .",

  "/wiki/Contraceptive_security": "Contraceptive security ( CS ) is a situation in which people are able to reliably choose , obtain , and use quality contraceptives for family planning and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases . The term refers primarily to efforts undertaken in developing countries to ensure contraceptive availability as an integral part of family planning programs . Organizations , usually government health agencies , work to ensure clients have long-term access to a range of high quality contraceptives and other essential health supplies . A framework and tool , the Strategic Pathway to Reproductive Health Commodity Security ( SPARHCS ) , was developed in 2004 by the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) and partners to help countries identify and prioritize key commodity security issues ; assess current capacity for commodity security among country or regional programs , systems and policies ; and shape commodity security strategic plans . Measures taken to provide contraceptive security may include strengthening contraceptive supply chains , forming CS committees , product quality assurance , promoting supportive policy environments , and examining financing options . Strengthening commodity security requires routine monitoring of donor and government commitment , policies , stakeholder coordination , and supply chain information . Tools including the CS Indicators and the CS Index offer ways of measuring contraceptive security , and allow comparisons over time and across countries . A recent analysis of 48 countries CS Index scores between 2003-2012 indicates that all regions improved on measures of supply chain , financing , health and social environment , access , and utilization , with the greatest progress made in sub-Saharan Africa . Subsidized products , particularly condoms and oral contraceptives , may be provided to increase accessibility for low-income people .",

  "/wiki/Food_energy": "Food energy is chemical energy that animals ( including humans ) derive from food through the process of cellular respiration . Cellular respiration may either involve the chemical reaction of food molecules with molecular oxygen ( aerobic respiration ) or the process of reorganizing the food molecules without additional oxygen ( anaerobic respiration ) .",
  "/wiki/Nutrition": "Nutrition is the science that interprets the nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance , growth , reproduction , health and disease of an organism . It includes food intake , absorption , assimilation , biosynthesis , catabolism and excretion . The diet of an organism is what it eats , which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods . For humans , a healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation , heat or leaching , and that reduces risk of foodborne illnesses . The seven major classes of human nutrients are carbohydrates , fats , fiber , minerals , proteins , vitamins , and water . Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients or micronutrients ( needed in small quantities ) . In humans , an unhealthy diet can cause deficiency-related diseases such as blindness , anemia , scurvy , preterm birth , stillbirth and cretinism , or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome ; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and osteoporosis . Undernutrition can lead to wasting in acute cases , and the stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition .",
  "/wiki/Malaria": "Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals . Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever , tiredness , vomiting , and headaches . In severe cases it can cause yellow skin , seizures , coma , or death . Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito . If not properly treated , people may have recurrences of the disease months later . In those who have recently survived an infection , reinfection usually causes milder symptoms . This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria . It is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group . The disease is most commonly spread by an infected female Anopheles mosquito . The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito 's saliva into a person 's blood . The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce . Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans .",
  "/wiki/Health_care": "Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery , or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people . Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields . Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals . Dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , medicine , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care . It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care , and tertiary care , as well as in public health . Access to health care may vary across countries , communities , and individuals , influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes . Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations ( such as insurance coverage ) , geographic barriers ( such as additional transportation costs , possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services ) , and personal limitations ( lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers , poor health literacy , low income ) . Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services , efficacy of treatments , and overall outcome ( well-being , mortality rates ) . Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism , a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies . An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country 's economy , development and industrialization .",
  "/wiki/Health_literacy": "Health literacy is the ability to obtain , read , understand , and use healthcare information in order to make appropriate health decisions and follow instructions for treatment . There are multiple definitions of health literacy , in part , because health literacy involves both the context ( or setting ) in which health literacy demands are made ( e.g. , health care , media , internet or fitness facility ) and the skills that people bring to that situation . Since health literacy is a primary contributing factor to health disparities , it is a continued and increasing concern for health professionals . The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy ( NAAL ) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either basic or below basic in terms of their health literacy and concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy . These individuals have difficulty with common health tasks including reading the label of a prescribed drug . Several factors may influence health literacy . However , the following factors have been shown to strongly increase this risk : age ( especially patients 65 years and older ) , limited English language proficiency or English as a second language , less education , and lower socioeconomic status . Patients with low health literacy understand less about their medical conditions and treatments and overall report worse health status . Various interventions , such as simplifying information and illustrations , avoiding jargon , using teach-back methods , and encouraging patients ' questions , have improved health behaviors in persons with low health literacy . The proportion of adults aged 18 and over in the U.S. , in the year 2010 , who reported that their health care providers always explained things so they could understand them was about 60.6% . This number increased 1% from 2007 to 2010 . The Healthy People 2020 initiative of the United States Department of Health and Human Services has included health literacy as a pressing new topic , with objectives for improving it in the decade to come ."
