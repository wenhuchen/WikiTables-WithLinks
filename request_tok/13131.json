It peaked at number three in the United Kingdom in August 1980 and was certified gold .

It reached number one in both countries , becoming Easton 's only chart-topper in those nations . Easton had released one single prior to 9 to 5 : Modern Girl . This had failed to chart highly , but after exposure on the BBC documentary , The Big Time , Pop Singer , both 9 to 5 and Modern Girl were propelled into the top ten at the same time , making her the second female artist ( after Ruby Murray ) to achieve this feat . 9 to 5 became a top three hit and was one of the best-selling singles of the year . Early in 1981 , EMI Records decided to launch Easton in the US and released 9 to 5 as her debut single . The title of the song was changed to Morning Train ( Nine to Five ) to avoid confusion with the Dolly Parton song of the same name , which charted nearly simultaneously with Easton 's record . Easton 's song went to # 1 on both the U.S. pop and adult contemporary charts ; it remained at the top for two weeks on Billboard 's pop chart . On Billboard 's 1981 year-end charts , it came in as the twelfth-biggest pop and thirteenth-biggest AC hit of the year 1981 . It also topped the RPM magazine pop and AC charts in Canada , reigning over the former for two weeks in May 1981 , while also reaching the summit in New Zealand , before being replaced by Joy Division 's Love Will Tear Us Apart .",

  "/wiki/Impossible_Princess": "Impossible Princess ( retitled Kylie Minogue in Europe for a temporary period ) is the sixth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue . It was first released in Japan by BMG on 22 October 1997 , and distributed worldwide by Mushroom and Deconstruction months later . The singer asserted partial creative control over the project - taking part as a co-producer and composer to the material - and was assisted by various musicians and producers , namely Brothers in Rhythm , Manic Street Preachers , David Ball and Rob Dougan . Sonically , Impossible Princess is a departure from Minogue 's previous music , having taken influence from the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s . Conceived as an experimental record , the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre , including trip hop , electronica , rock , drum and bass and house . Additionally , selected recordings experiment with cultural elements like Middle Eastern and Celtic music . Lyrically , the album 's central focus is Minogue 's self-discovery after a series of trips around Asia , America and Australasia , and further delves into the freedom of expression , relationships and emotions . Upon its release , critical and public reception of Impossible Princess was divided by regions , particularly between the UK , and throughout Australasia and the Americas . In retrospect , the record has achieved critical acclaim for its status as an underrated release , and was highlighted for Minogue 's creative input and mixture of genres . Commercially , the album reached the top 10 in Australia , Scotland and the United Kingdom , and was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) for physical shipments of 70,000 units ; however , its lack of success in Europe was further scrutinised by the British media . Five singles were released from the album : Some Kind of Bliss , Did It Again , Breathe , Too Far ( only as promotional single ) , and Cowboy Style , all of which experienced moderate success . After a small promotional tour in 1997 , Minogue embarked on the Intimate and Live tour in Australia and the UK the following year , which was a commercial and critical success .",
