Deville started his filmmaking career in the late 1950s , paralleling the emergence of the French New Wave directors . He never achieved the level of critical and international recognition of some of his contemporaries such as Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol , possibly because of his more conventional filmmaking style . Nevertheless , his films , especially his comedies from the 1970s and 1980s , were popular in his native France . [ citation needed ] One of Deville 's comedies , La Lectrice ( The Reader ) was probably his biggest success with international audiences . La Lectrice is about a woman ( played by Miou-Miou ) , who finds work reading novels for the blind but gradually finds herself unwittingly attracting a clientele of fetishists who enjoyed being read to . At one time his films were difficult to find in North America but presently ( 2007 ) seven of his films are available in DVD in the U.S. His 1980 film Le Voyage en douce was entered into the 30th Berlin International Film Festival .

Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard , Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , \u00c9ric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette , Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma before beginning his career as a film maker . Chabrol 's career began with Le Beau Serge ( 1958 ) , inspired by Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) . Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol , with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity . This is especially apparent in Les Biches ( 1968 ) , La Femme infid\u00e8le ( 1969 ) , and Le Boucher ( 1970 ) - all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran , who was his wife at the time . Sometimes characterized as a mainstream New Wave director , Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career . In 1978 , he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozi\u00e8re . On the strength of that effort , the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary ( 1991 ) and La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie ( 1996 ) . Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper , if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol 's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium.Some of his films become almost private jokes , made to amuse himself . James Monaco has called Chabrol the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave , and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we do n't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard .",
