Coca was also nominated for a Tony Award in 1978 for On the Twentieth Century and received a sixth Emmy nomination at the age of 80 for an episode of Moonlighting . She possessed a rubbery face capable of the broadest expressions - Life magazine compared her to Beatrice Lillie and Charlie Chaplin and described her characterizations as taking people or situations suspended in their own precarious balance between dignity and absurdity , and push ( ing ) them over the cliff with one single , pointed gesture . The magazine noted a particularly high-brow critic as observing , The trouble with most comedians who try to do satire is that they are essentially brash , noisy and indelicate people who have to use a sledge hammer to smash a butterfly . Miss Coca , on the other hand , is the timid woman who , when aroused , can beat a tiger to death with a feather . Aside from vaudeville , cabaret , film , theater and television , she voiced children 's cartoons and was even featured in the 1984 MTV music video Bag Lady by the band EBN-OZN , ultimately working well into her 80s . In a 1999 interview , Robert Ozn said during the shoot she was required to sit on the sidewalk in snow for hours during a blizzard with 15 degree temperatures . While the rest of us 20-somethings were moaning about the weather , warming ourselves by a heater , this little 75-year-old lady never once complained - put us all to shame . She was the most professional artist I 've ever worked with .",
