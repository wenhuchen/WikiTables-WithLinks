Organised by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , which had been created by Pierre de Coubertin , it was held in Athens , Greece , from 6 to 15 April 1896 . Fourteen nations and 241 , all male , athletes took part in the games . Participants were all European , or living in Europe , with the exception of the United States team . Winners were given a silver medal , while runners-up received a copper medal . Retroactively , the IOC has converted these to gold and silver , and awarded bronze medals to third placed athletes . Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals . The United States won the most gold medals , 11 , host nation Greece won the most medals overall , 46 . The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spyridon Louis . The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann , who won four events . Over 65% of the competing athletes were Greek . Athens had been unanimously chosen to stage the inaugural modern Games during a congress organised by Coubertin in Paris on 23 June 1894 , during which the IOC was also created , because Greece was the birthplace of the Ancient Olympic Games .",

One of the main historic attractions of Athens , it is the only stadium in the world built entirely of marble . A stadium was built on the site of a simple racecourse by the Athenian statesman Lykourgos ( Lycurgus ) c. 330 BC , primarily for the Panathenaic Games . It was rebuilt in marble by Herodes Atticus , an Athenian Roman senator , by 144 AD and had a capacity of 50,000 seats . After the rise of Christianity in the 4th century it was largely abandoned . The stadium was excavated in 1869 and hosted the Zappas Olympics in 1870 and 1875 . After being refurbished , it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the first modern Olympics in 1896 and was the venue for 4 of the 9 contested sports . It was used for various purposes in the 20th century and was once again used as an Olympic venue in 2004 . It is the finishing point for the annual Athens Classic Marathon .

Events were held on 6 April , 7 April , 9 April , and 10 April 1896 ( all dates are according to the Gregorian calendar ) . Altogether , 64 athletes , all men , from ten nations competed . This made athletics the most international of the nine sports at the 1896 Games . The American team of 11 , which featured only one national champion , was dominant , taking 9 of the 12 titles . No world records were set , because few international top competitors had participated . In addition , the curves of the track were very tight , making fast times in the running events virtually impossible . The heats of the 100 metres were the first Olympic event to be conducted , and the winner of the first heat , Francis Lane , can thus be considered the first Olympic winner .

No opening or closing ceremonies were held ; competitions began on 14 May and ended on 28 October . The Games were held as part of the 1900 World 's Fair . In total , 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports . This number relies on certain assumptions about which events were and were not Olympic . Many athletes , among them some who won events , did n't know that they had competed in the Olympic Games . Women took part in the games for the first time , and sailor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Pourtal\u00e8s , born Helen Barbey in New York City , became the first female Olympic champion . The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes , who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest . At the Sorbonne conference of 1894 , Pierre de Coubertin proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in 1900 in Paris . The delegates to the conference were unwilling to wait six years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896 . A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and that Paris would host the second celebration . Most of the winners in 1900 did not receive medals , but were given cups or trophies .",

It was the first time that the Olympic Games were held outside Europe . Boxing , the oldest combat sport , was introduced . Tensions caused by the Russo-Japanese War and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis in 1904 may have contributed to the fact that very few top ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in these Games . Only 62 of the 651 athletes who competed came from outside North America , and only 12-15 nations were represented in all .

Recent scholarship has indicated that the lacrosse tournament at the 1904 Games is nowhere near as orderly as presented above -- among other things , the game between Triple A and Mohawk Indians was actually a four-game series , tied at two games apiece , and the Mohawks may not have been an Olympic team at all , but a participant in an indigenous games competition with other tribes .",

These Games were the first to be staged in the Southern Hemisphere and Oceania , as well as the first to be held outside Europe and North America . Melbourne is the most southerly city ever to host the Olympics . Due to the Southern Hemisphere 's seasons being different from those in the Northern Hemisphere , the 1956 Games did not take place at the usual time of year , because of the need to hold the events during the warmer weather of the host 's spring/summer ( which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere 's autumn/winter ) . The Olympic equestrian events could not be held in Melbourne due to Australia 's strict quarantine regulations , so they were held in Stockholm five months earlier . This was the second time that the Olympics were not held entirely in one country , the first being the 1920 Summer Olympics , which were held in Antwerp , Belgium , with some events taking place in Ostend , Belgium and Amsterdam , Netherlands . Despite uncertainties and various complications encountered during the preparations , the 1956 Games went ahead in Melbourne as planned and turned out to be a success .
