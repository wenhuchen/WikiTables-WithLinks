Developed as Boeing 's first jet airliner , the 707 is a swept-wing design with podded engines . Although it was not the first jetliner in service , the 707 was the first to be commercially successful . Dominating passenger air transport in the 1960s and remaining common through the 1970s , the 707 is generally credited with ushering in the Jet Age . It established Boeing as one of the largest manufacturers of passenger aircraft , and led to the later series of airliners with 7x7 designations . The later 720 , 727 , 737 , and 757 share elements of the 707 's fuselage design . The 707 was developed from the Boeing 367-80 , a prototype jet first flown in 1954 . A larger fuselage cross-section and other modifications resulted in the initial-production 707-120 , powered by Pratt & Whitney JT3C turbojet engines , which first flew on December 20 , 1957 . Pan American World Airways began regular 707 service on October 26 , 1958 . Later derivatives included the shortened long-range 707-138 , hot and high 707-220 and the stretched 707-320 , all of which entered service in 1959 .

The aircraft 's performance has been upgraded with the E-2B , and E-2C versions , where most of the changes were made to the radar and radio communications due to advances in electronic integrated circuits and other electronics . The fourth major version of the Hawkeye is the E-2D , which first flew in 2007 . The E-2 was the first aircraft designed specifically for its role , as opposed to a modification of an existing airframe , such as the Boeing E-3 Sentry . Variants of the Hawkeye have been in continuous production since 1960 , giving it the longest production run of any carrier-based aircraft . The E-2 also received the nickname Super Fudd because it replaced the WF ( later E-1 ) Willy Fudd . In recent decades , the E-2 has been commonly referred to as the Hummer because of the distinctive sounds of its turboprop engines , quite unlike that of turbojet and turbofan jet engines .
