The album was named after the age of the singer during its production . 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19 , but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008-09 North American tour An Evening with Adele . Composed in the aftermath of the singer 's separation from her then partner , the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak , self-examination , and forgiveness . Adele began writing 21 in April 2009 , when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record . Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut , she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up . However , studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration . She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship , channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs . Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers , including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin , Paul Epworth , Ryan Tedder , Jim Abbiss , and Dan Wilson . Praised by critics for its understated production , vintage aesthetic , and Adele 's vocal performance , 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label XL Recordings .

It developed from the aborted Lifehouse project , a multi-media rock opera written by the group 's Pete Townshend as a follow-up to the band 's 1969 album Tommy . The project was cancelled owing to its complexity and to conflicts with Kit Lambert , the band 's manager , but the group salvaged some of the songs , without the connecting story elements , to release as their next album . Eight of the nine songs on Who 's Next were from Lifehouse , the lone exception being the John Entwistle-penned My Wife . Ultimately , the remaining Lifehouse tracks would all be released on other albums throughout the next decade . The Who recorded Who 's Next with assistance from recording engineer Glyn Johns . After producing the song Wo n't Get Fooled Again in the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio , they relocated to Olympic Studios to record and mix most of the album 's remaining songs . They made prominent use of synthesizer on the album , particularly on Wo n't Get Fooled Again and Baba O'Riley , which were both released as singles . The cover photo was shot by Ethan Russell ; it made reference to the monolith in the 1968 film 2001 : A Space Odyssey , as it featured group members standing by a concrete piling protruding from a slag heap , apparently having urinated against it . Who 's Next was an immediate success when it was released in August 1971 . It has since been viewed by many critics as the Who 's best record and one of the greatest albums of all time . It was reissued on CD several times , with additional songs originally intended for Lifehouse .",
