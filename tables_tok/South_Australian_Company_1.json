  "intro": "The South Australian Company (9 October 1835 - 17 March 1949), also referred to as the South Australia Company, was formed in London on 9 October 1835, after lobbying by the South Australian Association. The founding board, headed by George Fife Angas, consisted of wealthy British merchants in order to develop a new settlement in South Australia; its purpose was to build a new colony by meeting an essential financial obligation of the South Australia Act 1834. The South Australian Company ended business in its own right on 17 March 1949 when it was liquidated by Elders Trustee & Executor Company Ltd, which had been managing its Australian affairs since the death of the last Colonial Manager, Arthur Muller in 1936."
