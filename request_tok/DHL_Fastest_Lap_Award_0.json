It featured the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship , which began on 18 March and ended on 21 October after seventeen events . The Drivers ' Championship was won by Ferrari driver Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point at the final race of the season , making R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen the third Finnish driver to take the title . An appeal by McLaren regarding the legality of some cars in the final race could have altered the championship standings , but on 16 November , the appeal was rejected by the International Court of Appeal , confirming the championship results . R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen entered the final race in third position in the drivers ' standings , but emerged as champion after the chequered flag , a feat first accomplished by Giuseppe Farina in 1950 . It has since been accomplished again , by Sebastian Vettel , in 2010 . A major talking point of the season had been an espionage controversy involving Ferrari and McLaren , which led to McLaren being excluded from the Constructors ' Championship . As a result , Ferrari clinched the championship at the Belgian Grand Prix . The 2007 season heralded the end of the existing Concorde Agreement between the existing Formula One constructors and Bernie Ecclestone . In particular , Mercedes-Benz , BMW , and Honda ( collectively the Grand Prix Manufacturers ' Association ) had a number of outstanding disagreements with the FIA and Ecclestone on financial and technical grounds . They had threatened to boycott Formula One from the 2008 season onwards and instead stage their own rival series , before signing a memorandum of understanding ( MoU ) at the 2006 Spanish Grand Prix . The 2007 Australian Grand Prix was the first time since the 1986 Brazilian Grand Prix that there was a Formula One field without a car with a Cosworth engine .",

[ note 2 ] He won his first World Drivers ' Championship with McLaren in 2008 , before moving to Mercedes in 2013 , with whom he has won a further five titles . One of the most successful drivers in the history of the sport , Hamilton 's six World Championship titles is the second-most of all time , as is his tally of 84 race victories and 151 podium finishes . He currently holds the records for the all-time most career points ( 3431 ) , the all-time most pole positions ( 88 ) , the most grand slams in a season ( 3 ) and the most points in a season ( 413 ) . [ note 3 ] Born and raised in Stevenage , Hertfordshire , Hamilton enjoyed a successful ascent up the racing ladder and was signed to the McLaren young driver programme in 1998 . This later resulted in a Formula One drive with McLaren in 2007 , making Hamilton the first and only black driver to race in the sport . [ note 4 ] That season , Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point . The following season , he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion - making a crucial overtake on the last corner of the last lap in the last race of the season - to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history . After four more years with McLaren without finishing higher than fourth in the drivers ' standings , Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013 , reuniting with his childhood karting teammate , Nico Rosberg . Changes to regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines contributed to the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton , during which he has won five further World Championship titles . Hamilton won consecutive titles in 2014 and 2015 during an intense and sometimes volatile rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg , to match his hero Ayrton Senna 's three World Championships .",
