For younger members , the Scout method is part of the program to instill typical Scouting values such as trustworthiness , good citizenship , and outdoors skills , through a variety of activities such as camping , aquatics , and hiking . To further these outdoor activities , the BSA has four high-adventure bases : Northern Tier ( Minnesota , Manitoba , and Ontario ) , Philmont Scout Ranch ( New Mexico ) , Sea Base ( Florida , US Virgin Islands , and Bahamas ) , and Summit Bechtel Reserve ( West Virginia ) , as well as nearly one hundred separate camps and reservations specifically dedicated to scouts . The traditional Scouting divisions are Cub Scouting for ages 5 to 11 years , Scouts BSA for ages 11 to 18 , Venturing for ages 14 through 21 , and Sea Scouts for ages 14 through 21 . The BSA operates traditional Scouting by chartering local organizations , such as churches , clubs , civic associations , or educational organization , to implement the Scouting program for youth within their communities . Units are led entirely by volunteers appointed by the chartering organization , who are supported by local councils using both paid professional Scouters and volunteers . Additionally , Learning for Life is a non-traditional affiliate that provides in-school and career education . On February 1 , 2019 , the Boy Scouts of America renamed their flagship program , Boy Scouts , to Scouts BSA to reflect their change of policy to allow girls to join in separate , gender-specific troops .",

  "/wiki/Water_tower": "A water tower is an elevated structure supporting a water tank constructed at a height sufficient to pressurize a water distribution system for the distribution of potable water , and to provide emergency storage for fire protection . In some places , the term standpipe is used interchangeably to refer to a water tower . Water towers often operate in conjunction with underground or surface service reservoirs , which store treated water close to where it will be used . Other types of water towers may only store raw ( non-potable ) water for fire protection or industrial purposes , and may not necessarily be connected to a public water supply . Water towers are able to supply water even during power outages , because they rely on hydrostatic pressure produced by elevation of water ( due to gravity ) to push the water into domestic and industrial water distribution systems ; however , they can not supply the water for a long time without power , because a pump is typically required to refill the tower . A water tower also serves as a reservoir to help with water needs during peak usage times . The water level in the tower typically falls during the peak usage hours of the day , and then a pump fills it back up during the night . This process also keeps the water from freezing in cold weather , since the tower is constantly being drained and refilled . [ citation needed ]",

It is the third largest river by discharge volume in the United States and the largest tributary by volume of the north-south flowing Mississippi River that divides the eastern from western United States . The river flows through or along the border of six states , and its drainage basin includes parts of 15 states . Through its largest tributary , the Tennessee River , the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S . It is the source of drinking water for three million people . The lower Ohio River just below Louisville is obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the water level falls 26 ft. in 2 miles and is impassible for navigation .

The surgery is also called ovariectomy , but this term is mostly used in reference to animals , e.g . the surgical removal of ovaries from laboratory animals . Removal of the ovaries of females is the biological equivalent of castration of males ; the term castration is only occasionally used in the medical literature to refer to oophorectomy of women . In veterinary medicine , the removal of ovaries and uterus is called ovariohysterectomy ( spaying ) and is a form of sterilization . Partial oophorectomy or ovariotomy is a term sometimes used to describe a variety of surgeries such as ovarian cyst removal , or resection of parts of the ovaries . This kind of surgery is fertility-preserving , although ovarian failure may be relatively frequent . Most of the long-term risks and consequences of oophorectomy are not or only partially present with partial oophorectomy . In humans , oophorectomy is most often performed because of diseases such as ovarian cysts or cancer ; as prophylaxis to reduce the chances of developing ovarian cancer or breast cancer ; or in conjunction with hysterectomy ( removal of the uterus ) . The removal of an ovary together with the Fallopian tube is called salpingo-oophorectomy or unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( USO ) . When both ovaries and both Fallopian tubes are removed , the term bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( BSO ) is used . Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy are not common forms of birth control in humans ; more usual is tubal ligation , in which the Fallopian tubes are blocked but the ovaries remain intact .",

He served as a member of the Ohio State Senate from 1859 to 1861 . Garfield opposed Confederate secession , served as a major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War , and fought in the battles of Middle Creek , Shiloh , and Chickamauga . He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio 's 19th District . Throughout Garfield 's extended congressional service after the Civil War , he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator . Garfield initially agreed with Radical Republican views regarding Reconstruction , but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for freedmen . At the 1880 Republican National Convention , delegates chose Garfield - who had not sought the White House - as a compromise presidential candidate on the 36th ballot . In the 1880 presidential election , Garfield conducted a low-key front porch campaign and narrowly defeated Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock . Garfield 's accomplishments as president included a resurgence of presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments , purging corruption in the Post Office , and appointing a U.S. Supreme Court justice . He enhanced the powers of the presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York , starting a fracas that ended with Robertson 's confirmation and Conkling 's resignation from the Senate ."
