The club was the first hockey club in Ontario , a founding member of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) and played in the NHL from 1917 until 1934 . The club , which was officially the Ottawa Hockey Club ( Ottawa HC ) , was known by several nicknames , including the Generals in the 1890s , the Silver Seven from 1903 to 1907 and the Senators dating from 1908 . Generally acknowledged by hockey historians as one of the greatest teams of the early days of the sport , the club won numerous championships , starting with the 1891 to 1893 Ontario championships .

In 1950 , Canadian sports editors selected the Ottawa HC/Senators as Canada 's greatest team in the first half of the 20th century . The club was one of the first organized clubs in the early days of the sport of ice hockey , playing in the Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments in the early 1880s and founding the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada and the Ontario Hockey Association . Along with the rise of professionalism in ice hockey in the first decade of the 1900s , the club changed to a professional team and were founding members of the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and its successor , the National Hockey League .

Under their contracts , the Tigers players were to receive the same amount of money no matter how many games they played from December 1 , 1924 , to March 31 , 1925 ( even though the season started on November 29 , 1924 ) . NHL President Frank Calder was not amused , stating that the players would be fined or suspended if they did not play in the final series , but the players stated that they would rather retire than advantage be taken of them . The day of the final game of the Semi-Final , Tiger Shorty Green met with Calder to try to reach an agreement , but to no avail . The players were all suspended and fined $ 200 each , therefore eliminating themselves from the playoffs . Because of the suspension , the semi-final playoff series between Montreal and Toronto became the NHL championship series .

This was the first time since 1918 , when the Montreal Wanderers folded , that Montreal would have a second hockey team . In order to accommodate the Maroons , a new arena was built for them in 1924 , the Montreal Forum .

Some of the best players of the era played for the Maroons ; eleven players would be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame , while five of the six head coaches of the Maroons were also honoured .
