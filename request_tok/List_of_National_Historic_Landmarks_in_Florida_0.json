  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",

  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",

The range includes the area over which launched rockets are expected to fly , and within which some components of the rockets may land . Tracking stations are sometimes located in the range to assess the progress of the launches . Major spaceports often include more than one launch complex , which can be rocket launch sites adapted for different types of launch vehicles .

Various other routes led to Mexico , where slavery had been abolished , or overseas . An earlier escape route running south toward Florida , then a Spanish possession ( except 1763-83 ) , existed from the late 17th century until Florida became a United States territory in 1821 . One of the main reasons Florida was purchased by the United States was to end its function as a safe haven for escaped slaves . However , the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad was formed in the late 1700s . It ran north and grew steadily until the Civil War began . One estimate suggests that by 1850 , 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Railroad . British North America ( present-day Canada ) was a desirable destination , as its long border gave many points of access , it was further from slave catchers , and beyond the reach of the United States ' Fugitive Slave Acts . Most former slaves , reaching Canada by boat across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario , settled in Ontario . More than 30,000 people were said to have escaped there via the network during its 20-year peak period , although U.S. Census figures account for only 6,000 .",
  "/wiki/Fort_Barrancas": "Fort Barrancas ( 1839 ) or Fort San Carlos de Barrancas ( from 1787 ) is a United States military fort and National Historic Landmark in the former Warrington area of Pensacola , Florida , located physically within Naval Air Station Pensacola , which was developed later around it . The hill-top fort , connected to a sea level water battery , overlooks Pensacola Bay . From 1839-1844 , the historic Spanish fort on the hill was reconstructed and dramatically expanded in brick . This is now termed Fort Barrancas . The older , water battery downhill ( Baterie de San Antonio , 1787 ) has been separately named as Fort San Carlos . It is a remnant from the Spanish fortification , the wooden ( Spanish : Fuerte ) Fort San Carlos de Barrancas of the late 18th century . Due to changing requirements , the U.S. Army deactivated Fort Barrancas on April 15 , 1947 following World War II .

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country .

The war led to emergence of U.S. predominance in the Caribbean region , and resulted in U.S. acquisition of Spain 's Pacific possessions . That led to U.S. involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately in the Philippine-American War . The main issue was Cuban independence . Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish rule . The U.S. later backed these revolts upon entering the Spanish-American War . There had been war scares before , as in the Virginius Affair in 1873 , but in the late 1890s , American public opinion was agitated by reports of gruesome Spanish atrocities . The business community had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains . It lobbied vigorously against going to war .

As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro .
