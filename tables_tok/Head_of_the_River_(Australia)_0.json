  "intro": "The Head of the River is a name given to annual Australian rowing regattas held in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia. The regattas feature competing independent schools, and the winner of the 1st division boys or girls race is crowned the Head of the River. The name Head of the River is taken from similar regattas held in other countries including the Head of the River Race held annually on the Thames in London since 1926."
