  "/wiki/The_National_Archives_(United_Kingdom)": "The National Archives ( TNA , Welsh : Yr Archifau Cenedlaethol ) is a non-ministerial government department . Its parent department is the Department for Digital , Culture , Media and Sport of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . It is the official archive of the UK government and for England and Wales ; and guardian of some of the nation 's most iconic documents , dating back more than 1,000 years . There are separate national archives for Scotland ( the National Records of Scotland ) and Northern Ireland ( the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland ) . TNA was formerly four separate organisations : the Public Record Office ( PRO ) , the Historical Manuscripts Commission , the Office of Public Sector Information ( OPSI ) and Her Majesty 's Stationery Office ( HMSO ) . The Public Record Office still exists as a legal entity , as the enabling legislation has not been modified , and documents held by the institution thus continue to be cited by many scholars as part of the PRO . Since 2008 , TNA has also hosted the former UK Statute Law Database , now known as legislation.gov.uk . It is institutional policy to include the definite article , with an initial capital letter , in its name ( hence The National Archives , abbreviated as TNA ) but this practice is not always followed in the non-specialist media .",
  "/wiki/Airspeed_Horsa": "The Airspeed AS.51 Horsa was a British troop-carrying glider used during the Second World War . It was developed and manufactured by Airspeed Limited , alongside various subcontractors ; the type was named after Horsa , the legendary 5th-century conqueror of southern Britain . Having been greatly impressed by the effective use of airborne operations by Nazi Germany during the early stages of the Second World War , such as during the Battle of France , the Allied powers sought to establish capable counterpart forces of their own . The British War Office , determining that the role of gliders would be an essential component of such airborne forces , proceeded to examine available options . An evaluation of the General Aircraft Hotspur found it to lack the necessary size , thus Specification X.26/40 was issued . It was from this specification that Airspeed Limited designed the Horsa , a large glider capable of accommodating up to 30 fully equipped paratroopers , which was designated as the AS 51 . The Horsa was inducted in large numbers by the British Army Air Corps and the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) ; both services used it to conduct various air assault operations through the conflict . The type was used to perform an unsuccessful attack on the German Heavy Water Plant at Rjukan in Norway , known as Operation Freshman , and during the invasion of Sicily , known as Operation Husky . Large numbers of Horsa were subsequently used during the opening stages of the Battle of Normandy , being used in the British Operation Tonga and American operations . It was also deployed in quantity during Operation Dragoon , Operation Market Garden , and Operation Varsity . Further use of the Horsa was made by various other armed forces , including the United States Army Air Forces .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Indian_Navy": "The Royal Indian Navy ( RIN ) was the naval force of British India and the Dominion of India . Along with the Presidency armies , later the Indian Army , and from 1932 the Indian Air Force , it was one of the Armed Forces of British India . From its origins in 1612 as the East India Company 's Marine , the Navy underwent various changes , including changes to its name . Over time it was named the Bombay Marine ( 1686 ) , the Bombay Marine Corps ( 1829 ) , the Indian Navy ( 1830 ) , Her Majesty 's Indian Navy ( 1858 ) , the Bombay and Bengal Marine ( 1863 ) , the Indian Defence Force ( 1871 ) , Her Majesty 's Indian Marine ( 1877 ) and the Royal Indian Marine ( 1892 ) . It was finally named the Royal Indian Navy in 1934 . However , it remained a relatively small force until the Second World War , when it was greatly expanded . After the partition of India into two independent states in 1947 , the Navy was split between Pakistan and India . One-third of the assets and personnel were assigned to Royal Pakistan Navy . Approximately two thirds of the fleet remained with the Union of India , as did all land assets within its territory . This force , still under the name of Royal Indian Navy , became the navy of the Dominion of India until the country became a republic on 26 January 1950 . It was then renamed the Indian Navy .",
  "/wiki/Resistance_during_World_War_II": "Resistance movements during World War II occurred in every occupied country by a variety of means , ranging from non-cooperation to propaganda to hiding crashed pilots and even to outright warfare and the recapturing of towns . In many countries , resistance movements were sometimes also referred to as The Underground . Among the most notable resistance movements were the Polish Resistance , including the Polish Home Army , Le\u015bni , and the whole Polish Underground State ; Yugoslav Partisans , the Soviet partisans , [ a ] the Italian Resistenza led mainly by the Italian CLN ; the French Resistance , the Belgian Resistance , the Norwegian Resistance , the Danish Resistance , the Greek Resistance , the Czech resistance , the Albanian resistance , the Dutch Resistance especially the LO ( national hiding organisation ) and the politically persecuted opposition in Germany itself ( there were 16 main resistance groups and at least 27 failed attempts to assassinate Hitler with many more planned ) : in short , across German-occupied Europe . Many countries had resistance movements dedicated to fighting or undermining the Axis invaders , and Nazi Germany itself also had an anti-Nazi movement . Although Britain was not occupied during the war , the British made complex preparations for a British resistance movement . The main organisation was created by the Secret Intelligence Service ( SIS , aka MI6 ) and is now known as Section VII . In addition there was a short-term secret commando force called the Auxiliary Units . Various organizations were also formed to establish foreign resistance cells or support existing resistance movements , like the British Special Operations Executive and the American Office of Strategic Services ( the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency ) . There were also resistance movements fighting against the Allied invaders . In Italian East Africa , after the Italian forces were defeated during the East African Campaign , some Italians participated in a guerrilla war against the British ( 1941-1943 ) . The German Nazi resistance movement ( Werwolf ) never amounted to much . The Forest Brothers of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania included many fighters who operated against the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States into the 1960s ."
