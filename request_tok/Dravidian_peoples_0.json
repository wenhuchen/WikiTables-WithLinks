On 15 November 2000 , southern Bihar was ceded to form the new state of Jharkhand . Only 11.3% of the population of Bihar lives in urban areas , which is the lowest in India after Himachal Pradesh . Additionally , almost 58% of Biharis are below the age of 25 , giving Bihar the highest proportion of young people of any Indian state . In ancient and classical India , the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power , learning , and culture . From Magadha arose India 's first empire , the Maurya empire , as well as one of the world 's most widely adhered-to religions : Buddhism . Magadha empires , notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties , unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule . Another region of Bihar is Mithila which was an early centre of learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Gondwana_(India)": "Gondwana is a region of India , named after the Gondi people who live there ( though they can also be found in other parts of India ) . The name of the ancient continent of Gondwanaland was derived from Gondwana , because some of the earliest rock formations of this continent were first investigated in part of the region , in modern Odisha . As Gondi people are spread widely across central India , and are a minority almost everywhere , there is no unambiguous boundary to the region . However , the core region can be considered to be the eastern part of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra , the parts of Madhya Pradesh immediately to the north of it , and parts of the west of Chhattisgarh . The wider region extends into parts of northern Telangana , western Odisha and southern Uttar Pradesh . The region is part of the northern Deccan plateau , with an average height of about 600-700 metres . Much of it is rugged and hilly . Geologically it is mostly Pre-Cambrian rock , with some areas dated to Permian and Triassic periods . Part of it is overlaid with alluvium , and in the west it is overlaid with the igneous rocks of the Deccan Traps . The climate is hot and semi-arid . The natural vegetation is dry monsoon forest , or monsoon scrub forest . Large parts of it are still forest , and it contains several national parks , including tiger populations .",

In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 .

Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

The most outlying island is Ono-i-Lau . The two major islands , Viti Levu and Vanua Levu , account for 87% of the total population of 883,483 . The capital , Suva , on Viti Levu , serves as the country 's principal cruise-ship port . [ failed verification ] About three-quarters of Fijians live on Viti Levu 's coasts , either in Suva or in smaller urban centres such as Nadi - where tourism is the major local industry - or Lautoka , where the sugar-cane industry is paramount . Due to its terrain , the interior of Viti Levu is sparsely inhabited . The majority of Fiji 's islands formed through volcanic activity starting around 150 million years ago . Some geothermal activity still occurs today , on the islands of Vanua Levu and Taveuni . The geothermal systems on Viti Levu are non-volcanic in origin , with low-temperature ( c. 35-60 degrees Celsius ) surface discharges . Sabeto Hot Springs near Nadi is a good example .",

Before the 18th century and British colonisation , the Toda coexisted locally with other ethnic communities , including the Kota , Badaga and Kurumba , in a loose caste-like society , in which the Toda were the top ranking . During the 20th century , the Toda population has hovered in the range 700 to 900 . Although an insignificant fraction of the large population of India , since the early 19th century the Toda have attracted a most disproportionate amount of attention because of their ethnological aberrancy and their unlikeness to their neighbours in appearance , manners , and customs . The study of their culture by anthropologists and linguists proved significant in developing the fields of social anthropology and ethnomusicology . The Toda traditionally live in settlements called mund , consisting of three to seven small thatched houses , constructed in the shape of half-barrels and located across the slopes of the pasture , on which they keep domestic buffalo . Their economy was pastoral , based on the buffalo , which dairy products they traded with neighbouring peoples of the Nilgiri Hills . Toda religion features the sacred buffalo ; consequently , rituals are performed for all dairy activities as well as for the ordination of dairymen-priests . The religious and funerary rites provide the social context in which complex poetic songs about the cult of the buffalo are composed and chanted . Fraternal polyandry in traditional Toda society was fairly common ; however , this practice has now been totally abandoned , as has female infanticide . During the last quarter of the 20th century , some Toda pasture land was lost due to outsiders using it for agriculture or afforestation by the State Government of Tamil Nadu .
