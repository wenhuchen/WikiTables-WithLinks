  "/wiki/City_of_London": "The City of London is a city , county and a local government district [ note 1 ] that contains the historic centre and the primary central business district ( CBD ) of London . It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages , but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City 's borders . The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London , though it remains a notable part of central London . Administratively , it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London ; however , the City of London is not a London borough , a status reserved for the other 32 districts ( including London 's only other city , the City of Westminster ) . It is also a separate ceremonial county , being an enclave surrounded by Greater London , and is the smallest county in the United Kingdom . The City of London is widely referred to simply as the City ( differentiated from the phrase the city of London by capitalising City ) and is also colloquially known as the Square Mile , as it is 1.12 sq mi ( 716.80 acres ; 2.90 km2 ) in area . Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom 's trading and financial services industries , which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City . The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City . London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis , or the 32 London boroughs , in addition to the City of London itself . This wider usage of London is documented as far back as 1888 , when the County of London was created . The local authority for the City , namely the City of London Corporation , is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council , such as being the police authority . It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries .",

  "/wiki/Watling_Street": "Watling Street is a route in England that began as an ancient trackway first used by the Britons , mainly between the areas of modern Canterbury and St Albans using a natural ford near Westminster . The Romans later paved the route , which then connected the Kentish ports of Dubris ( Dover ) , Rutupiae ( Richborough ) , Lemanis ( Lympne ) , and Regulbium ( Reculver ) to their bridge over the Thames at Londinium ( London ) . The route continued northwest through Verulamium ( St Albans ) on its way to Viroconium ( Wroxeter ) . The Romans considered the continuation on to Blatobulgium ( Birrens ) beyond Hadrian 's Wall to be part of the same route , leading some scholars to call this Watling Street as well , although others restrict it to the southern leg . Watling Street was the site of Boudica 's defeat by the Romans and was later the southwestern border of the Danelaw . In the early 19th century , the course between London and the Channel was paved and became known as the Great Dover Road : today , the route from Dover to London forms part of the A2 road .

After King James IV of Scotland was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 , his head was brought to London and hastily buried in this church . John Stow admired the building , and called it a proper thing . The church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London , and after some pressure it was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren in 1673 . The organ was built by Thomas Elliot in 1800 : the most noted organist was Dr Henry Hiles . In 1854 the declining residential population led to proposals to reduce the number of churches within the Square Mile - a procedure the church 's vicar had himself proposed . The church was eventually demolished under the auspices of the Union of Benefices Act in 1897 , and many bodies were disinterred from the churchyard and reburied at Brookwood Cemetery . The parish was then united with St Alban Wood Street , and , after the destruction of that church in World War II , with St Vedast Foster Lane .

  "/wiki/Wood_Street,_London": "Wood Street is a street in the City of London , the historic centre and primary financial district of London .

The northernmost end runs alongside The Postern , part of the Barbican estate , stopping at Andrewes House . Today Wood Street lies within the wards of Bassishaw ( north of Gresham Street ) and Cheap ( south of Gresham Street ) . The street was originally the main north-south route through the Roman Fort , which was discovered after World War II bombing . The north gate of the fort became Cripplegate , the south gate of the fort was just south of the junction with Love Lane , and the road diverts slightly to the east suggesting that the gate was blocked up or in use , and they had to knock through the Roman fort wall to allow Wood Street to continue . It has been suggested that this was an early road after the so-called Alfredian restoration of the City in around 886 AD . The road led from the main port at Queenhithe ( Bread Street ) to the main market street at Cheapside and then on north to Cripplegate and out of London to the north . Wood Street is the location of the headquarters of the City of London Police , at its corner with Love Lane .
