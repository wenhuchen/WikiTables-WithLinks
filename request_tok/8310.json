  "/wiki/Pierre_Fontaine_(composer)": "Pierre Fontaine ( pronounced [ pj\u025b\u0281 f\u0254\u0303t\u025bn ] ; c. 1380 - c. 1450 ) was a French composer of the transitional era between the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance , and a member of the Burgundian School of composers . While he was well known at the time , most of his music has probably been lost . All of his surviving music is secular , and all his compositions are chansons .",
  "/wiki/Jacobus_Vide": "Jacobus Vide ( French : Jacques Vide ; fl . 1405-1433 ) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the transitional period between the medieval period and early Renaissance . He was an early member of the Burgundian School , during the reigns of John the Fearless and Philip the Good . The earliest mention of him is from the archives of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris , in 1405 , where he was probably a choirboy ( some uncertainty exists with regard to the name ) . In 1410 he held a position at the church of St Donatian in Bruges , and around the same time he may have been a singer in the chapel of Antipope John XXIII . His service to the Burgundian court began sometime between then and 1423 , when he was listed as a valet de chambre for Philip the Good , and in 1426 he was given charge of instructing and caring for two choirboys . In 1428 he was promoted to the position of secretary to Philip the Good . No records of his activity after 1433 have yet been discovered . All eight of his surviving works are rondeaux , secular French songs which were a favorite of the Burgundians . They are somewhat unusual , in comparison to other music of the period , in their free use of dissonance , and in addition are marked by frequent use of cross-rhythms . All of the characteristic cadences of the period - the Landini cadence , the Burgundian cadence , and the V-I cadence where the lowest voice jumps an octave to avoid parallel fifths - are common in Vide 's music . One of his more enigmatic songs is a three-voice rondeau , Las , j'ay perdu mon espincel , in which the upper voices , the superius and the tenor , are fully written out , but the contratenor is left blank .",

  "/wiki/Johannes_Legrant": "Johannes Legrant ( fl . c. 1420 - 1440 ) was a French or Burgundian composer of the early Renaissance . Little is known for certain about his life , and as is common for composers of the early 15th century , there are problems of identification in the existing records . In 1423 and 1424 , he may have been a vicar at St. Vincent in Soignes , a collegiate church with an active music establishment . Antwerp Cathedral 's records mention a 'Heer Jan le Grant ' as a singer there from 1441 to 1443 , and this may also have been him . All of Legrant 's surviving music is vocal . His style is related to that of the early Burgundian School , and resembles some of the early work of Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois ; influence may have gone either way . He wrote elegant melodic lines in the Burgundian manner , and used the secular forms which were typical of the Burgundians : the rondeau and the ballade . Imitation is also prominent in his work . In addition to his secular music - four rondeaux and a ballade - four sacred pieces have survived , including two settings of the Gloria of the mass , for two and three voices , and a three voice Credo . It is not known if he is related to Guillaume Legrant , a slightly better-known contemporary of Johannes . The one ballade attributed to Johannes has also been suggested to be the work of Guillaume based on stylistic characteristics .",
  "/wiki/Gilles_Binchois": "Gilles de Binche ( called Binchois ; also known as Gilles de Bins ; c. 1400 - 20 September 1460 ) was a composer from the Low Countries , one of the earliest members of the Burgundian school and one of the three most famous composers of the early 15th century . While often ranked behind his contemporaries Guillaume Dufay and John Dunstable by contemporary scholars , his works were still cited , borrowed and used as source material after his death .",
  "/wiki/Hugo_de_Lantins": "Hugo de Lantins ( fl . 1420-1430 ) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the late Medieval era and early Renaissance . He was active in Italy , especially Venice , and wrote both sacred and secular music ; he may have been a relative of Arnold de Lantins , another composer active at the same time in the same area . Little is known about his life , except that he was probably in Venice during the 1420s , for he wrote ceremonial music for the Doge Francesco Foscari ; his music appears in several collections from that city . Evidently he wrote music for the wedding of Cleofe Malatesta and Theodore Palaiologos , Prince of Sparta , in 1421 , since precise topical details occur in the text to the music . He almost certainly was known to Dufay , since both composers wrote music for some of the same events , and Dufay mentioned him in the text to one of the compositions he wrote during his stay in Rimini with the Malatesta family ( 1420-1424 ) . Hugo 's music is more forward looking than that of Arnold , making use of imitation , which was to become the prevailing musical device for the next hundred years and more ; indeed , imitation is more prevalent in the music of Lantins than in the music of any other composer of the early 15th century . Most of Hugo 's music is for three voices , though occasionally he added a fourth . Several sections of masses have survived , but none complete , as well as five motets , one of which is isorhythmic . In the secular music category he wrote many rondeaux , all in French , as well as some ballate in Italian ( almost certainly for the royal wedding of the Malatesta family ) .",
  "/wiki/Arnold_de_Lantins": "Arnold de Lantins ( fl . 1420s - before 2 July 1432 ) was a Netherlandish composer of the late medieval and early Renaissance eras . He is one of a few composers who shows aspects of both medieval and Renaissance style , and was a contemporary of Dufay during Dufay 's sojourn in Italy . Very little is known about his life , except for a few years in the 1420s to around 1430 . It is presumed that he was from Flanders or adjacent areas . In the early 1420s he was probably in the service of the Malatesta family in either Rimini or Pesaro , since Dufay mentioned him in the text of a rondeau which was written between 1420 and 1424 . Lantins was in Venice in 1428 and Rome in 1431 , in the latter city as a singer in the papal chapel choir , along with Dufay . He was only in Rome six months ; after that he disappears from history . Rome was entering a period of turmoil related to the Conciliar movement after the death , in February 1431 , of Pope Martin V ; many musicians left at that time or shortly after , and Lantins may have been one of them . It is not known for certain if Arnold de Lantins was a relative of Hugo de Lantins , a composer active at the same time , but since their works often appear together in collections and they seem to have been in the same geographical regions , it is not unlikely . However , a sharp stylistic difference between the works of the two composers shows they can not be the same person .

  "/wiki/Reginaldus_Libert": "Reginaldus Libert ( Reginald ; also Liebert ) ( fl . c. 1425-1435 ) was a French composer of the early Renaissance . He was a minor member of the Burgundian School , a contemporary of Guillaume Dufay , and one of the first to use fauxbourdon in a mass setting . Little to nothing is known of his life . He may be the same as a Reginaldus who was employed at the cathedral in Cambrai as a singing teacher to the boys in 1424 . Four compositions by Libert have been identified . Two are rondeaux , which was the popular type of French chanson at the time . Both rondeaux are for three voices with only the uppermost voice being supplied with a text ( instruments were often used for the other parts , especially in the music of the Burgundians ) . His most famous composition is a complete setting of the mass , for three voices , which contains some of the earliest use of fauxbourdon . An unusual feature of this mass is that it contains music not only for the Ordinary ( Kyrie , Gloria , Credo , Sanctus , Agnus Dei ) but the Proper as well ; in this regard it resembles the Missa Sancti Jacobi of Guillaume Dufay , which is often considered to be the earliest example of fauxbourdon to which the term was applied by the composer . Libert 's mass uses a plainsong source which permeates all the movements , and migrates from voice to voice . Stylistically , this mass , as well as his other compositions , fit the period around 1430 .",

  "/wiki/Adrien_Basin": "Adrien Basin ( fl . 1457 - 1476 ; died after 1498 ) was a Franco-Flemish composer , singer , and diplomat of the Burgundian School of the early Renaissance . He was listed along with Antoine Busnois and Hayne van Ghizeghem as one of the personal singers to Charles the Bold , Duke of Burgundy . Little is known about his early life , and he first appears in the records as a singer to Isabella of Bourbon , who was the wife of Charles the Bold . Later he seems to have joined the personal chapel of Charles , when Charles became Duke . Unlike many of the musicians of the Burgundian court , who travelled along with Charles on his military exploits ( who loved music as much as war , and enjoyed having musical entertainment during his military adventures ) , Basin seems to have remained in Bruges most of the time . After the death of Charles at the Battle of Nancy in 1477 , Basin served the court as a diplomat , according to records from the 1480s . The last record of his life is dated to 1498 , when he was named as heir to his brother Pierre . All of Basin 's surviving music is secular , although some of the anonymous music in the manuscripts of the time may be by him . Of his secular songs , one became immensely popular . Nos amys vous vous abus\u00e9s was used by several later composers , including Tinctoris , as a source for mass settings , and numerous copies of the song have been found , some in collections as far away as Poland and Portugal . Before the advent of music printing at the beginning of the 16th century , such distribution is rare , and generally shows the popularity of a piece .",
  "/wiki/Hayne_van_Ghizeghem": "Hayne van Ghizeghem ( c. 1445 - 1476 to 1497 ) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the early Renaissance Burgundian School . While many of his works have survived , little is known about his life . He was probably born in Gijzegem ( near Ghent , in modern Belgium ) . His musical talent must have been noticed early by Charles , Count of Charolais ( later to become Charles the Bold ) because there is a record of his being personally assigned to a teacher by him ; in 1467 he is shown in the Burgundian employment records as being a singer . In addition , he was named along with Adrien Basin and Antoine Busnois as chantre et valet de chambre to Charles , indicating the special regard in which he was held . In addition to serving as a singer and composer , he evidently served as a soldier as well , for there is a record of purchase of military equipment for him , prior to the campaign against Li\u00e8ge by Charles . Charles took his musicians along with him on his campaigns , because he loved music as much as war , and insisted on entertainment ; however Hayne was the only one of his famous musicians known to be also outfitted as a soldier . He is known to have been at the Siege of Beauvais in 1472 , where Charles was decisively repulsed by the French , and Hayne was long presumed by scholars to have been killed in that battle . However , recent research into his surviving compositions indicates that some may have been produced after 1472 , especially because they seem to show stylistic development beyond the ones that can be definitively dated to 1472 or before . Current scholarship suggests he may have survived the siege , and gone to work at the court of France . That such a distinguished singer and composer worked for France 's bitter rival would have been an offense easy to forgive , for Burgundian musicians of the time were highly prized . Hayne is principally known as a composer of chansons , and most of these are rondeaux .",
