It was led by the thrice-elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , until he was disqualified for contempt of the Supreme Court in 2017 . The party 's platform is generally conservative , which involves supporting free market capitalism . One of several continuing factions of the original Muslim League , the seeds of the party were sown following the 1985 Elections when the Prime Minister of Pakistan Muhammad Khan Junejo organised the supporters of President Zia-ul-Haq 's dictatorship into a single party , known as the Pakistan Muslim League . After President Zia 's death in 1988 , under the leadership of Fida Mohammad Khan , a large faction split away from the Junejo-led Pakistan Muslim League , and formed a conservative alliance with various right-wing and Islamist political parties , called the Islamic Democratic Alliance . The alliance formed a government in 1990 under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif . In 1993 , the alliance dissolved and the party assumed its current shape , branding itself as the Nawaz faction of the Pakistan Muslim League after its like , in contrast to the Junejo faction . Since its foundation by General Zia ul Haq , PML-N , along with the People 's Party , has dominated the two-party political system of Pakistan .
