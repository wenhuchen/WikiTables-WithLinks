  "/wiki/Rowing_(sport)": "Rowing , sometimes referred to as crew in the United States , is a sport whose origins reach back to Ancient Egyptian times . It involves propelling a boat ( racing shell ) on water using oars . By pushing against the water with an oar , a force is generated to move the boat . The sport can be either recreational for enjoyment or fitness , or competitive , when athletes race against each other in boats . There are a number of different boat classes in which athletes compete , ranging from an individual shell ( called a single scull ) to an eight-person shell with a coxswain ( called a coxed eight ) . Modern rowing as a competitive sport can be traced to the early 17th century when races ( regattas ) were held between professional watermen on the River Thames in London , United Kingdom . Often prizes were offered by the London Guilds and Livery Companies . Amateur competition began towards the end of the 18th century with the arrival of boat clubs at the British public schools of Eton College , Shrewsbury School , Durham School , and Westminster School . Similarly , clubs were formed at the University of Oxford , with a race held between Brasenose College and Jesus College in 1815 . At the University of Cambridge the first recorded races were in 1827 . Public rowing clubs were beginning at the same time ; in England Leander Club was founded in 1818 , in Germany Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club was founded in 1836 and in the United States Narragansett Boat Club was founded in 1838 and Detroit Boat Club was founded in 1839 . In 1843 , the first American college rowing club was formed at Yale University .",

  "/wiki/Skeleton(sport)": "Skeleton is a winter sliding sport in which a person rides a small sled , known as a skeleton bobsled ( or -sleigh ) , down a frozen track while lying face down and head-first . The sport and the sled may have been named from the bony appearance of the sled . Unlike other sliding sports of bobsleigh and luge , the race always involves single riders . Like bobsleigh , but unlike luge , the race begins with a running start from the opening gate at the top of the course . The skeleton sled is thinner and heavier than the luge sled , and skeleton affords the rider more control , making it safer than luge . Skeleton is the slowest of the three sliding sports , as skeleton 's face-down , head-first riding position is less aerodynamic than luge 's face-up , feet-first ride . Previously , skeleton appeared in the Olympic program in St. Moritz , Switzerland , in 1928 and again in 1948 . It was added permanently to the Olympic program for the 2002 Winter Olympics , at which stage a women 's race was added . During elite racing the rider experiences accelerations up to 5 g and reaches speeds over 130 km/h ( 81 mph ) .",

  "/wiki/Sailboarding": "Windsurfing is a surface water sport that emerged when mid 20th century inventors combined surfing and sailing to create a new paradigm in water sports . It emerged in the early 1970s from the surf culture scene of California . By the late 1970s it had gained a strong following across North America , and in the 1980s it went global in a massive expansion . Windsurfing is predominately a recreational sport , popular at flat water locations around the world where the sport is safest and most accessible . The sport has two distinct interest groups , categorised as essentially Racers and Riders ( surf culture ) with many participants embracing both . The racing side of windsurfing has three peak contests : The Olympics , where competitors are on identical long-board equipment with a yachting regatta format ; The PWA Slalom Tour , where competitors use unlimited high speed short-board equipment and race to the finish line after a timed start ; and the Defi-Wind Gruissan in France which is the largest and most prestigious long distance racing event in the world . The racing side of the sport emerged from yachting influences . The rider side of windsurfing also has three peak contests : The PWA Wave Tour , The IWT Wave Tour , and The Aloha Classic ( final event of both wave tours ) . No rider has ever won all three in one year - the triple crown . These competitions are defined by the use of unlimited equipment , with wave riding and jumping performances assessed by a panel of judges . This rider/surfer side of windsurfing emerged from the surf culture of California and Hawaii and these influences remain very strong to this day , with many participants fully embracing both Windsurf Wave Riding and traditional Surfing . The racing evolution side of the sport includes multiple disciplines : long-board classes of Raceboard , Windsurfer One Design , and many other one design fleets ; and the short-board disciplines such as Formula class , and what is arguably the most spectacular forms of racing in windsurfing : high speed slalom racing , the increasingly impressive foil racing , extreme speed sailing , and ocean Marathon using high speed slalom equipment .",
