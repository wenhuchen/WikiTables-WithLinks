  "/wiki/Amarcord": "Amarcord ( Italian : [ amar\u02c8k\u0254rd ] ) is a 1973 Italian comedy-drama film directed by Federico Fellini , a semi-autobiographical tale about Titta , an adolescent boy growing up among an eccentric cast of characters in the village of Borgo San Giuliano ( situated near the ancient walls of Rimini ) in 1930s Fascist Italy . The film 's title is a univerbation of the Romagnolo phrase a m'arc\u00f4rd ( I remember ) . The title then became a neologism of the Italian language , with the meaning of 'nostalgic revocation ' . Titta 's sentimental education is emblematic of Italy 's lapse of conscience . Fellini skewers Mussolini 's ludicrous posturings and those of a Catholic Church that imprisoned Italians in a perpetual adolescence by mocking himself and his fellow villagers in comic scenes that underline their incapacity to adopt genuine moral responsibility or outgrow foolish sexual fantasies . The film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film , and was nominated for two more Academy Awards : Best Director and Best Original Screenplay .",

  "/wiki/Adult_film": "Pornographic films ( pornos ) , erotic films , or sex films , are films that present sexually explicit subject matter in order to arouse and satisfy the viewer . Pornographic films present sexual fantasies and usually include erotically stimulating material such as nudity ( softcore ) and sexual intercourse ( hardcore ) . A distinction is sometimes made between erotic and pornographic films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit sexuality , and focuses more on arousal than storytelling , but the distinction is highly subjective . Pornographic films are produced and distributed on a variety of media , depending on the demand and technology available , including traditional film stock in various formats , video for home viewing , DVDs , Internet download , cable TV , in addition to other media . Today , pornographic films are sold or rented on DVD ; shown through Internet streaming , special channels and pay-per-view on cable and satellite ; and viewed in rapidly disappearing adult theaters . By law , they are generally not permitted to be shown in mainstream cinemas , or on free-to-air television . Films with risqu\u00e9 content have been produced since the invention of motion picture in the 1880s . Production of such films was profitable , and a number of producers began to specialize in their production . However , various groups within society considered such depictions immoral , labeled them pornographic , and attempted to have them suppressed under obscenity laws , with varying degrees of success . Such films continued to be produced , but could only be distributed by underground channels . Because the viewing of such films carried a social stigma , they were viewed at brothels , adult movie theaters , stag parties , at home , in private clubs , and also at night cinemas . Only in the 1970s , during the Golden Age of Porn , were pornographic films semi-legitimized ; and by the 1980s , pornography on home video achieved wider distribution .",

  "/wiki/Can_dialectics_break_bricks?": "La dialectique peut-elle casser des briques ? , in English , Can Dialectics Break Bricks ? , is a 1973 Situationist film produced by the French director Ren\u00e9 Vi\u00e9net which explores the development of class conflict through revolutionary agitation against a backdrop of graphic kung-fu fighting . For its visuals the film uses 1972 martial arts film Crush by Tu Guangqi , which tells the story of anti-colonialist revolt in Korea during the period of Japanese occupation . The source film was dubbed over by the filmmakers as an example of d\u00e9tournement . Vi\u00e9net 's intention was to adapt a spectacular film typical of the film industry to the purposes of a radical critique of cultural hegemony and thus an expression of subversive revolutionary ideals . The narrative focuses on a conflict between proletarians and bureaucrats within state capitalism . The proletarians enlist their grasp of dialectics in the fight against their oppressors , while the bureaucrats defend themselves using a combination of co-optation and violence . The film is noted for its humorous approach to this subject matter . The film also contains numerous celebratory references to revolutionaries who fought for the realisation of a post-capitalist world , including Marx , Bakunin , and Wilhelm Reich , as well as scathing criticism directed toward the French Communist Party , trade unionism and Maoism . Subplots dealing with issues of gender equality , alienation , the Paris Commune , May 1968 and situationist politics itself are riddled throughout the film .",

  "/wiki/Situationist_International": "The Situationist International ( SI ) was an international organization of social revolutionaries made up of avant-garde artists , intellectuals , [ who ? ] and political theorists , prominent in Europe from its formation in 1957 to its dissolution in 1972 . The intellectual foundations of the Situationist International were derived primarily from anti-authoritarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century , particularly Dada and Surrealism . Overall , situationist theory represented an attempt to synthesize this diverse field of theoretical disciplines into a modern and comprehensive critique of mid-20th century advanced capitalism . The situationists recognized that capitalism had changed since Karl Marx 's formative writings , but maintained that his analysis of the capitalist mode of production remained fundamentally correct ; they rearticulated and expanded upon several classical Marxist concepts , such as his theory of alienation . In their expanded interpretation of Marxist theory , the situationists asserted that the misery of social alienation and commodity fetishism were no longer limited to the fundamental components of capitalist society , but had now in advanced capitalism spread themselves to every aspect of life and culture . They rejected the idea that advanced capitalism 's apparent successes - such as technological advancement , increased income , and increased leisure - could ever outweigh the social dysfunction and degradation of everyday life that it simultaneously inflicted . Essential to situationist theory was the concept of the spectacle , a unified critique of advanced capitalism of which a primary concern was the progressively increasing tendency towards the expression and mediation of social relations through objects . The situationists believed that the shift from individual expression through directly lived experiences , or the first-hand fulfillment of authentic desires , to individual expression by proxy through the exchange or consumption of commodities , or passive second-hand alienation , inflicted significant and far-reaching damage to the quality of human life for both individuals and society . Another important concept of situationist theory was the primary means of counteracting the spectacle ; the construction of situations , moments of life deliberately constructed for the purpose of reawakening and pursuing authentic desires , experiencing the feeling of life and adventure , and the liberation of everyday life . When the Situationist International was first formed , it had a predominantly artistic focus ; emphasis was placed on concepts like unitary urbanism and psychogeography . Gradually , however , that focus shifted more towards revolutionary and political theory .",
