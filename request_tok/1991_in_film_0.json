The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger , Linda Hamilton , Robert Patrick , and Edward Furlong as its principal cast . It is the sequel to the 1984 film The Terminator , as well as the second installment in the Terminator franchise . Terminator 2 follows Sarah Connor ( Hamilton ) and her ten-year-old son John ( Furlong ) as they are pursued by a new , more advanced Terminator : the liquid metal , shapeshifting T-1000 ( Patrick ) , sent back in time to kill John Connor and prevent him from becoming the leader of the human resistance . A second , less advanced Terminator ( Schwarzenegger ) is also sent back in time to protect John . While talks of a followup to The Terminator arose following its release , its development was stalled due to technical limitations regarding computer-generated imagery , a vital aspect of the film , and legal issues with original producer Hemdale Film Corporation , who controlled half of the franchise rights . In 1990 , Carolco Pictures acquired the rights from Hemdale and production was immediately started , with Schwarzenegger , Hamilton , and Cameron returning . Principal photography began in October 1990 and lasted until March 1991 . Its visual effects saw breakthroughs in computer-generated imagery , including the first use of natural human motion for a computer-generated character and the first partially computer-generated main character . At the time of its release , with a budget of $ 102 million , Terminator 2 : Judgment Day was the most expensive film ever made . Terminator 2 : Judgment Day was released in the United States on July 3 , 1991 by TriStar Pictures . It was a critical success upon its release , with praise going towards the performances of its cast , the action scenes , and its visual effects .",
