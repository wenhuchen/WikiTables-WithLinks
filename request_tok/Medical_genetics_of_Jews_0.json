Complications can include anemia and newborn jaundice . Some people never have symptoms . It is an X-linked recessive disorder that results in defective glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme . Red blood cell breakdown may be triggered by infections , certain medication , stress , or foods such as fava beans . Depending on the specific mutation the severity of the condition may vary . Diagnosis is based on symptoms and supported by blood tests and genetic testing . Avoiding triggers is important . Treatment of acute episodes may include medications for infection , stopping the offending medication , or blood transfusions . Jaundice in newborns may be treated with bili lights .",

More broadly , Bloom syndrome is a member of a class of clinical entities that are characterized by chromosomal instability , genomic instability , or both and by cancer predisposition . Cells from a person with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that includes excessive crossovers between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) .

Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast , a change in breast shape , dimpling of the skin , fluid coming from the nipple , a newly-inverted nipple , or a red or scaly patch of skin . In those with distant spread of the disease , there may be bone pain , swollen lymph nodes , shortness of breath , or yellow skin . Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female , obesity , lack of physical exercise , drinking alcohol , hormone replacement therapy during menopause , ionizing radiation , early age at first menstruation , having children late or not at all , older age , prior history of breast cancer , and family history . About 5-10% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person 's parents , including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others . Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk . Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas , while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas . In addition , there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer . Some cancers , such as ductal carcinoma in situ , develop from pre-invasive lesions . The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump . Once the diagnosis is made , further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective . The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial .",

Since the underlying body biochemistry is slightly different in individuals with FH , their high cholesterol levels are less responsive to the kinds of cholesterol control methods which are usually more effective in people without FH ( such as dietary modification and statin tablets ) . Nevertheless , treatment ( including higher statin doses ) is usually effective . FH is classified as a type 2 familial dyslipidemia . There are five types of familial dyslipidemia ( not including subtypes ) , and each are classified from both the altered lipid profile and by the genetic abnormality . For example , high LDL ( often due to LDL receptor defect ) is type 2 . Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism , triglyceride metabolism , and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles , such as VLDL and IDL . About 1 in 100 to 200 people have mutations in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein , which normally removes LDL from the circulation , or apolipoprotein B ( ApoB ) , which is the part of LDL that binds with the receptor ; mutations in other genes are rare . People who have one abnormal copy ( are heterozygous ) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40 . Having two abnormal copies ( being homozygous ) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood . Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder , inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , occurring in 1:500 people in most countries ; homozygous FH is much rarer , occurring in 1 in a million people .

GSD Ia is caused by a deficiency enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase , and GSD Ib is caused a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate translocase .

  "/wiki/HEXA": "Hexosaminidase A ( alpha polypeptide ) , also known as HEXA , is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the HEXA gene , located on the 15th chromosome . Hexosaminidase A and the cofactor GM2 activator protein catalyze the degradation of the GM2 gangliosides and other molecules containing terminal N-acetyl hexosamines . Hexosaminidase A is a heterodimer composed of an alpha subunit ( this protein ) and a beta subunit . The alpha subunit polypeptide is encoded by the HEXA gene while the beta subunit is encoded by the HEXB gene . Gene mutations in the gene encoding the beta subunit ( HEXB ) often result in Sandhoff disease ; whereas , mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit ( HEXA , this gene ) decrease the hydrolysis of GM2 gangliosides , which is the main cause of Tay-Sachs disease .",
  "/wiki/Torsion_dystonia": "Torsion dystonia , also known as dystonia musculorum deformans , is a disease characterized by painful muscle contractions resulting in uncontrollable distortions . This specific type of dystonia is frequently found in children , with symptoms starting around the ages of 11 or 12 . It commonly begins with contractions in one general area such as an arm or a leg that continue to progress throughout the rest of the body . It takes roughly 5 years for the symptoms to completely progress to a debilitating state .",
  "/wiki/DYT1": "Torsin-1A ( TorA ) also known as dystonia 1 protein ( DYT1 ) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TOR1A gene ( also known as DQ2 or DYT1 ) . TorA localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and contiguous perinuclear space , where its ATPase activity is activated by either LULL1 or LAP1 , respectively .",
  "/wiki/Usher_syndrome": "Usher syndrome , also known as Hallgren syndrome , Usher-Hallgren syndrome , retinitis pigmentosa-dysacusis syndrome or dystrophia retinae dysacusis syndrome , is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in any one of at least 11 genes resulting in a combination of hearing loss and visual impairment . It is a major cause of deafblindness and is at present incurable . Usher syndrome is classed into three subtypes ( I , II and III ) according to the genes responsible and the onset of deafness . All three subtypes are caused by mutations in genes involved in the function of the inner ear and retina . These mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern . The occurrence of Usher syndrome varies across the world and across the different syndrome types , with rates as high as 1 in 12,500 in Germany to as low as 1 in 28,000 in Norway . Type I is most common in Ashkenazi Jewish and Acadian populations , and type III is rarely found outside Ashkenazi Jewish and Finnish populations . Usher syndrome is named after Scottish ophthalmologist Charles Usher , who examined the pathology and transmission of the syndrome in 1914 .",
