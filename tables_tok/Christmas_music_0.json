Part of the wonder of music is how it helps us continue to create real memories and traditions . These treasured songs are very special to so many people and are a beloved part of ASCAP 's repertoire . '' Paul Williams , President and chairman , American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) The top thirty most-played holiday songs for the 2015 holiday season are ranked here , all titles written or co-written by ASCAP songwriters and composers . [ 31 ] Most of these songs in some way describe or are reminiscent of Christmas traditions , how Western Christian countries tend to celebrate the holiday , i.e. , with caroling , mistletoe , exchanging of presents , a Christmas tree , feasting , jingle bells , etc . Celebratory or sentimental , and nostalgic in tone , they hearken back to simpler times with memorable holiday practices\u2014expressing the desire either to be with someone or at home for Christmas . The winter-related songs celebrate the climatic season , with all its snow , dressing up for the cold , sleighing , etc . Many titles help define the mythical aspects of modern Christmas celebration : Santa Claus bringing presents , coming down the chimney , being pulled by reindeer , etc . New mythical characters are created , defined , and popularized by these songs ; `` Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer '' , adapted from a major retailer 's promotional poem , was introduced to radio audiences by Gene Autry in 1949 . His follow-up a year later introduced `` Frosty the Snowman '' , the central character of his song . Though overtly religious , and authored ( at least partly ) by a writer of many church hymns , no drumming child appears in any biblical account of the Christian nativity scene . This character was introduced to the tradition by Katherine K. Davis in her `` The Little Drummer Boy '' ( written in 1941 , with a popular version being released in 1958 ) .",
  "uid": "Christmas_music_0",
  "intro": "Christmas music comprises a variety of genres of music on a variety of topics, religious and otherwise, regularly performed or heard around the Christmas season. Christmas carols remain a large part of the popular Christmas song canon, with numerous titles being added in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s in the United States. Subject matter ranges from the nativity of Jesus Christ, to gift-giving and merrymaking, to mythical figures surrounding the holidays such as Santa Claus and his elves. Many songs simply have a winter or seasonal theme, or have been adopted into the canon for other reasons. The Great Depression era of the 1930s brought a stream of songs of American origin, most of which did not explicitly reference the Christian nature of the holiday, but rather the more secular traditional Western themes and customs associated with Christmas. These included songs aimed at children such as Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as well as sentimental ballad-type songs performed by famous crooners of the era, such as Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and White Christmas, the latter of which remains the best-selling single of all time as of 2018. Performances of Christmas music at public concerts, in churches, at shopping malls, on city streets, and in private gatherings is an integral staple of the Christmas holiday in many cultures across the world. Radio stations often convert to a 24-7 Christmas music format leading up to or during the holidays, starting sometimes before Thanksgiving in the United States - as part of a phenomenon known as Christmas creep."
