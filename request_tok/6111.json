Prior to that , he was formerly a professional soccer player , who last played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer . Barclay initially skipped college , opting instead to sign a Project-40 contract with MLS in 2001 , at the age of 18 , which allocated him to the Tampa Bay Mutiny . Barclay made a significant impact on a very bad Mutiny team as a rookie , appearing in 23 games , 12 starts , and scoring three goals and two assists . The Mutiny was contracted after the 2001 season ; Barclay was selected 8th overall in the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft by the San Jose Earthquakes . Barclay did not make much of an impact on the side that had just won MLS Cup , disappointingly only appearing in 12 games , and registering no goals or assists . He was traded to D.C. United in exchange for a draft pick , but disappointed in D.C. as well ; he only appeared in three games for United , as coach Ray Hudson preferred not to play young players . He was again traded after the 2003 season , joining the Columbus Crew , his fourth team in four seasons . He made little impact on the Crew , however , again appearing in only three games in 2004 . After appearing only once in the 2005 season , Barclay was released by Columbus on November 15 , 2005 . Barclay represented the U.S. national team at the Under-18 , Under-20 , and Under-23 levels , but his playing time with those teams dwindled as he was unable to break into an MLS side .

  "/wiki/Nike_Project-40": "Generation Adidas is a joint venture between Major League Soccer and U.S. Soccer aimed at raising the level of young professional soccer talent in the United States . The program , sponsored by Adidas , offers professional-ready players in the U.S. developmental system not yet eligible for the MLS SuperDraft early entry , allowing MLS to compete with foreign professional clubs without comparable restrictions on player signing . From its establishment in 1997 to 2005 , the program was sponsored by Nike and was called Project-40 . Originally intended to improve the U.S. national team player pool , American national team eligibility is no longer required for program entry . Carlos Parra was the first Project-40 player when he signed with the league and was allocated to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in 1997 . Since then , the program has included players such as Tim Howard , DaMarcus Beasley , Maurice Edu , Carlos Bocanegra , Clint Dempsey , Jozy Altidore , Ben Olsen , Sacha Kljestan , Freddy Adu , Brad Guzan , Michael Bradley , Nick Rimando and Kyle Beckerman . Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum . Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as professional , and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer . As a result , Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out . From 1998 to 2000 , MLS entered a team of Project-40 players , supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time , into the A-League in the USL .
