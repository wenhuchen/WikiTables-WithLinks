  "/wiki/Brevet_(military)": "In many of the world 's military establishments , a brevet ( /br\u0259\u02c8v\u025bt/ ( listen ) or /\u02c8br\u025bv\u026at/ ( listen ) ) was a warrant giving a commissioned officer a higher rank title as a reward for gallantry or meritorious conduct but without conferring the authority , precedence , or pay of real rank . An officer so promoted was referred to as being brevetted ( for example , he was brevetted Major General ) . The promotion would be noted in the officer 's title ( for example , Bvt . Maj. Gen. Joshua L. Chamberlain or Bvt . Col. Arthur MacArthur ) . It is not to be confused with a brevet in Francophone European military circles , where it is an award , nor should it be confused with temporary commissions .",
  "/wiki/Thomas_L._Kane": "Thomas Leiper Kane ( January 27 , 1822 - December 26 , 1883 ) was an American attorney , abolitionist , philanthropist , and military officer who was influential in the western migration of the Latter-day Saint movement and served as a Union Army colonel and general of volunteers in the American Civil War . He received a brevet promotion to major general for gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg . After meeting members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at an 1846 Philadelphia conference , Kane offered to help in their conflicts with the US government as they tried to migrate West . He negotiated to allow them to occupy land along the Missouri River , and later worked to help Utah achieve statehood . He passed on an offer to govern the territory , giving the position to Brigham Young . During 1857 and 1858 , Kane attempted to mediate a dispute between the Latter-day Saints and the US government , persuading Young to concede his governorship to President Buchanan 's appointee , preventing further escalation of the Utah War . During the Civil War , Kane organized a Pennsylvania regiment ( the Bucktails ) , and served as lieutenant colonel . After his promotion of brigadier general of volunteers , he journeyed by to convey intelligence about Robert E. Lee 's Gettysburg Campaign . Kane and his brigade were victorious at Gettysburg , but Kane had fallen ill and was forced to resign his commission . After the war , Kane and his family settled and helped establish Kane , Pennsylvania . He died of pneumonia in 1883 . Both Kane County , Utah and Kanesville Tabernacle are named for Kane .",

He was the first U.S. president to be assassinated , with his funeral and burial marking an extended period of national mourning . Occurring near the end of the American Civil War , the assassination was part of a larger conspiracy intended by Booth to revive the Confederate cause by eliminating the three most important officials of the United States government . Conspirators Lewis Powell and David Herold were assigned to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt was tasked with killing Vice President Andrew Johnson . Beyond Lincoln 's death , the plot failed : Seward was only wounded and Johnson 's would-be attacker lost his nerve . After a dramatic initial escape , Booth was killed at the climax of a 12-day manhunt . Powell , Herold , Atzerodt and Mary Surratt were later hanged for their roles in the conspiracy .",

  "/wiki/Ambassadors_of_the_United_States": "Ambassadors of the United States are persons nominated as ambassadors by the President to serve as United States diplomats to individual nations of the world , to international organizations , and as ambassadors-at-large . Their appointment needs to be confirmed by the United States Senate . An ambassador can be appointed during a recess , but he or she can only serve as ambassador until the end of the next session of Congress unless subsequently confirmed . Ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the President , meaning they can be dismissed at any time . Appointments change regularly for various reasons , such as reassignment or retirement . An ambassador may be a career Foreign Service Officer ( career diplomat - CD ) or a political appointee ( PA ) . In most cases , career foreign service officers serve a tour of approximately three years per ambassadorship whereas political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president . As embassies fall under the State Department 's jurisdiction , ambassadors answer directly to the Secretary of State . The United States Department of State provides lists of ambassadors which are updated periodically . ( A recent list was issued on December 4 , 2018 . A further 24 nominees were confirmed on January 2 , 2019 , and a number of ambassadorships remain vacant . ) A listing by country of past chiefs of mission is maintained by the Office of the Historian of the U.S. Department of State .",

They were among the major states of Italy from roughly the 8th century until the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia successfully unified the Italian Peninsula by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870 . At their zenith , the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio ( which includes Rome ) , Marche , Umbria and Romagna , and portions of Emilia . These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the temporal power of the pope , as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy . By 1861 , much of the Papal States ' territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy . Only Lazio , including Rome , remained under the Pope 's temporal control . In 1870 , the Pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all , except the Basilica of St Peter and the papal residence and related buildings around the Vatican quarter of Rome , which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily . In 1929 the head of the Italian government , at the time the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini , ended the crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See by negotiating the Lateran Treaty , signed by the two parties . This recognized the sovereignty of the Holy See over a newly created international territorial entity , the Vatican City State , limited to a token territory .",

Of the major battles of the war , Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides . Although the battle itself was inconclusive , the Union Army 's repulse of two Confederate attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg , and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of Middle Tennessee . Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans 's Army of the Cumberland marched from Nashville , Tennessee , on December 26 , 1862 , to challenge General Braxton Bragg 's Army of Tennessee at Murfreesboro . On December 31 , each army commander planned to attack his opponent 's right flank , but Bragg struck first . A massive assault by the corps of Maj. Gen. William J. Hardee , followed by that of Leonidas Polk , overran the wing commanded by Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook . A stout defense by the division of Brig . Gen. Philip Sheridan in the right center of the line prevented a total collapse , and the Union assumed a tight defensive position backing up to the Nashville Turnpike . Repeated Confederate attacks were repulsed from this concentrated line , most notably in the cedar Round Forest salient against the brigade of Col. William B. Hazen . Bragg attempted to continue the assault with the division of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge , but the troops were slow in arriving and their multiple piecemeal attacks failed . Fighting resumed on January 2 , 1863 , when Bragg ordered Breckinridge to assault the well-fortified Union position on a hill to the east of the Stones River .

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era , one whose poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . Chopin was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw , which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland . A child prodigy , he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20 , less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising . At 21 , he settled in Paris . Thereafter - in the last 18 years of his life - he gave only 30 public performances , preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon . He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons , for which he was in high demand . Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries ( including Robert Schumann ) . After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska from 1836 to 1837 , he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin ( known by her pen name , George Sand ) . A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838-39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition . In his final years , he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling , who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848 . For most of his life , Chopin was in poor health ."
