  "/wiki/Source_code": "In computing , source code is any collection of code , possibly with comments , written using a human-readable programming language , usually as plain text . The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers , who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code . The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code that can be executed by the computer . The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time . Alternatively , source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed . Most application software is distributed in a form that includes only executable files . If the source code were included it would be useful to a user , programmer or a system administrator , any of whom might wish to study or modify the program .",

CERN is an official United Nations Observer . The acronym CERN is also used to refer to the laboratory , which in 2016 had 2,500 scientific , technical , and administrative staff members , and hosted about 12,000 users . In the same year , CERN generated 49 petabytes of data . CERN 's main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research - as a result , numerous experiments have been constructed at CERN through international collaborations . The main site at Meyrin hosts a large computing facility , which is primarily used to store and analyse data from experiments , as well as simulate events . Researchers need remote access to these facilities , so the lab has historically been a major wide area network hub . CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web .",

  "/wiki/Music_video": "A music video is a short film that integrates a song with imagery , and is produced for promotional or artistic purposes . Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings . There are also cases where songs are used in tie-in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song . Tie-ins and merchandising can be used for toys or for food or other products . Although the origins of the music video date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s , they again came into prominence in the 1980s when the channel MTV ( originally Music Television ) based its format around the medium . Prior to the 1980s , these kinds of videos were described by various terms including illustrated song , filmed insert , promotional ( promo ) film , promotional clip , promotional video , song video , song clip or film clip . Music videos use a wide range of styles and contemporary video-making techniques , including animation , live action , documentary , and non-narrative approaches such as abstract film . Some music videos combine different styles with the music , such as animation and live action . Combining these styles and techniques has become more popular because of the variety for the audience . Many music videos interpret images and scenes from the song 's lyrics , while others take a more thematic approach . Other music videos may not have any concept , being merely a filmed version of the song 's live concert performance .",

The term record label derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer 's name , along with other information . Within the mainstream music industry , recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base , market their albums , and be both promoted and heard on music streaming services , radio , and television .

  "/wiki/Copyright": "Copyright is the exclusive right given to the creator of a creative work to reproduce the work , usually for a limited time . The creative work may be in a literary , artistic , educational , or musical form . Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work , but not the idea itself . A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations , such as the fair use doctrine in the United States . Some jurisdictions require fixing copyrighted works in a tangible form . It is often shared among multiple authors , each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work , and who are commonly referred to as rights holders . [ citation needed ] These rights frequently include reproduction , control over derivative works , distribution , public performance , and moral rights such as attribution . Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered territorial rights . This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state , do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction . Copyrights of this type vary by country ; many countries , and sometimes a large group of countries , have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works cross national borders or national rights are inconsistent . Typically , the public law duration of a copyright expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies , depending on the jurisdiction . Some countries require certain copyright formalities to establishing copyright , others recognize copyright in any completed work , without formal registration .",
  "/wiki/Remix_culture": "Remix culture , sometimes read-write culture , is a society that allows and encourages derivative works by combining or editing existing materials to produce a new creative work or product . A remix culture would be , by default , permissive of efforts to improve upon , change , integrate , or otherwise remix the work of copyright holders . While a common practice of artists of all domains throughout human history , the growth of exclusive copyright restrictions in the last several decades limits this practice more and more by the legal chilling effect . In reaction , Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig who considers remixing a desirable concept for human creativity has worked since the early 2000s on a transfer of the remixing concept into the digital age . Lessig founded the Creative Commons in 2001 which released Licenses as tools to enable remix culture again , as remixing is legally prevented by the default exclusive copyright regime applied currently on intellectual property . The remix culture for cultural works is related to and inspired by the earlier Free and open-source software for software movement , which encourages the reuse and remixing of software works .",
