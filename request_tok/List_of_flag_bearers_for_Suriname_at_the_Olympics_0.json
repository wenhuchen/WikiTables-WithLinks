  "/wiki/Badminton": "Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net . Although it may be played with larger teams , the most common forms of the game are singles ( with one player per side ) and doubles ( with two players per side ) . Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach ; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court . Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side 's half of the court . Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net . Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire , service judge , or ( in their absence ) the opposing side . The shuttlecock is a feathered or ( in informal matches ) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports . In particular , the feathers create much higher drag , causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly . Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports . The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature . The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock . European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia , with recent competitions dominated by China .",

The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid . The Games received general praise for their organisation , with the volunteers , the British military and public enthusiasm praised particularly highly .

Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system .

He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors .",

Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo , but only in pre-arranged forms ( kata , \u5f62 ) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ( randori , \u4e71\u53d6\u308a ) .

  "/wiki/Wim_Esajas": "Siegfried Willem Wim Esajas ( 16 April 1935 - 30 April 2005 ) was a middle-distance runner from Suriname , who qualified for the Athletics at the Men 's 800 m event at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome , Italy and was supposed to be the first Surinamese Olympian . Esajas missed the event , and it was alleged that he overslept it , whereas he was simply given a wrong starting time by Fred Glans , the head of Suriname 's Olympic delegation . Esajas was a multiple national record holder in the 800 m , 1500 m and 3000 m events in the 1950s , and was selected as the Surinamese Sportman of the Year 1956 . He retired from sport after the 1960 Olympics , graduated in horticulture from a college in Deventer , the Netherlands , and returned to Suriname to grow flowers . In 2005 , Suriname 's Olympic Committee presented Esajas with a plaque honoring him as Suriname 's first Olympian and with a letter of apology for the mistake made by its official in 1960 . Esajas died two weeks later of an uncertain illness . He was survived by his son Werner ."
