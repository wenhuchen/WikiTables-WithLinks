Its growth as a major port was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution . Along with handling general cargo , freight , and raw materials such as coal and cotton , the city merchants were involved in the Atlantic slave trade . In the 19th century , it was a major port of departure for English and Irish emigrants to North America .

  "/wiki/Art_Deco": "Art Deco , sometimes referred to as Deco , is a style of visual arts , architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I . Art Deco influenced the design of buildings , furniture , jewelry , fashion , cars , movie theatres , trains , ocean liners , and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners . It took its name , short for Arts D\u00e9coratifs , from the Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes ( International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts ) held in Paris in 1925 . It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . During its heyday , Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress . Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art . It featured rare and expensive materials , such as ebony and ivory , and exquisite craftsmanship . The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style . In the 1930s , during the Great Depression , Art Deco became more subdued . New materials arrived , including chrome plating , stainless steel , and plastic . A sleeker form of the style , called Streamline Moderne , appeared in the 1930s ; it featured curving forms and smooth , polished surfaces .",
  "/wiki/Anglicanism": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",

Historically part of Lancashire , Bootle 's proximity to the River Mersey and the industrial city of Liverpool to the south saw it grow rapidly in the 1800s , first as a dormitory town for wealthy merchants , and then as a centre of commerce and industry in its own right following the arrival of the railway and the expansion of the docks and shipping industries . The town was heavily damaged in World War II with air raids against the port and other industrial targets . Post-war economic success in the 1950s and 1960s gave way to a downturn , precipitated by a reduction in the significance of Liverpool Docks internationally , and changing levels of industrialisation , coupled with the development of modern suburbs and the expansion of industries into the Merseyside hinterlands . By the 1980s , there had been a sharp spike in unemployment and population decline . Large-scale renewal projects have begun to help regenerate the local economy .",

When the borough was created in the Local Government Act 1972 , a name was sought that would not unduly identify the borough with any of its constituent parts , particularly the former county boroughs of Bootle and Southport . The locality had strong links with both the Earl of Sefton and the Earl of Derby , resident of Knowsley Hall , and given the fact that the immediately adjacent borough was subsequently named Knowsley it seems equally likely that the choice of name was derived from the names of the local nobility . A Sefton Rural District covering some of the villages in the district existed from 1894 to 1932 .",

The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery .

There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry .

The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",

  "/wiki/Blackpool": "Blackpool /\u02c8bl\u00e6kpu\u02d0l/ ( listen ) is a town and seaside resort on the Lancashire coast in North West England . The town is on the Irish Sea , between the Ribble and Wyre estuaries , 15 miles ( 24 km ) northwest of Preston , 27 miles ( 43 km ) north of Liverpool , 28 miles ( 45 km ) northwest of Bolton and 40 miles ( 64 km ) northwest of Manchester . It had an estimated population of 139,720 at the 2011 Census , making it the most populous town in Lancashire . Throughout the Medieval and Early Modern period , Blackpool was a coastal hamlet in Lancashire 's Hundred of Amounderness , and remained such until the mid-18th century when it became fashionable in England to travel to the coast in the summer to improve well-being . In 1781 , visitors attracted to Blackpool 's 7-mile ( 11 km ) sandy beach were able to use a new private road , built by Thomas Clifton and Sir Henry Hoghton . Stagecoaches began running to Blackpool from Manchester in the same year , and from Halifax in 1782 . In the early 19th century , Henry Banks and his son-in-law John Cocker erected new buildings in Blackpool such that its population grew from less than 500 in 1801 to over 2,500 in 1851 . St John 's Church in Blackpool was consecrated in 1821 . Blackpool rose to prominence as a major centre of tourism in England when a railway was built in the 1840s connecting it to the industrialised regions of Northern England . The railway made it much easier and cheaper for visitors to reach Blackpool , triggering an influx of settlers , such that in 1876 Blackpool was incorporated as a borough , governed by its own town council and aldermen . In 1881 , Blackpool was a booming resort with a population of 14,000 and a promenade complete with piers , fortune-tellers , public houses , trams , donkey rides , fish-and-chip shops and theatres . By 1901 the population of Blackpool was 47,000 , by which time its place was cemented as the archetypal British seaside resort .",

The borough of Telford and Wrekin has been a separate unitary authority since 1998 but continues to be included in the ceremonial county . The county 's population and economy is centred on five towns : the county town of Shrewsbury , which is culturally and historically important and close to the centre of the county ; Telford , a new town in the east which was constructed around a number of older towns , most notably Wellington , Dawley and Madeley , which is today the most populous ; and Oswestry in the northwest , Bridgnorth just to the south of Telford , and Ludlow in the south . The county has many market towns , including Whitchurch in the north , Newport northeast of Telford and Market Drayton in the northeast of the county .

  "/wiki/Romanesque_architecture": "Romanesque architecture is an architectural style of medieval Europe characterized by semi-circular arches . There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque style , with proposals ranging from the 6th to the 11th century , this later date being the most commonly held . In the 12th century it developed into the Gothic style , marked by pointed arches . Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent , making it the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman architecture . The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as Norman architecture . Combining features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions , Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality , thick walls , round arches , sturdy pillars , barrel vaults , large towers and decorative arcading . Each building has clearly defined forms , frequently of very regular , symmetrical plan ; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the Gothic buildings that were to follow . The style can be identified right across Europe , despite regional characteristics and different materials . Many castles were built during this period , but they are greatly outnumbered by churches . The most significant are the great abbey churches , many of which are still standing , more or less complete and frequently in use . The enormous quantity of churches built in the Romanesque period was succeeded by the still busier period of Gothic architecture , which partly or entirely rebuilt most Romanesque churches in prosperous areas like England and Portugal . The largest groups of Romanesque survivors are in areas that were less prosperous in subsequent periods , including parts of southern France , rural Spain and rural Italy .",

  "/wiki/Harlescott": "Harlescott is a suburb of the town of Shrewsbury , county town of Shropshire . It is one of the most industrial parts of the town , and is the 5th most deprived ward in non-metropolitan Shropshire [ citation needed ] Neighbouring suburbs include Sundorne to the east and Ditherington to the south . Note that many locals , particularly those born before about 1985 , use the term Harlescott to refer to a wider area than the council ward , including much of what is officially Sundorne ( to the east of Whitchurch and Battlefield Roads ) and also much of the Heathgates and Mount Pleasant areas ( sometimes called Heath Farm ) . The centre of the area contains the remains of a moated settlement , probably the original Harlescott Grange . The earthwork and buried remains of the medieval moated site are situated on a gentle north east facing slope . It is now surrounded by a modern housing estate , but from this location there would originally have been extensive views of the surrounding area . The moat is now visible as a slight earthwork having been drained in 1950 and largely infilled following the construction of the housing estate . The arms of the moat , which survive as buried features , are between 12m and 15m wide and define a rectangular island approximately 40m by 46m . Material excavated from the moat has been used to raise the surface of the island between 1.2m and 2m above the level of the surrounding ground . An account of the site in 1937 indicated that the sides of the moat were lined with masonry and when the moat was drained , 13th century pottery was found . Sherds of medieval pottery were also found when a small-scale archaeological excavation was conducted in 1960 . Shrewsbury 's livestock market was at Harlescott ( between 1956 and 2006 [ citation needed ] - it is now at a new site out-of-town at Battlefield ) ."
