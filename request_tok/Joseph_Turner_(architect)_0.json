  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",

  "/wiki/River_Elwy": "The River Elwy ( Afon Elwy in Welsh ) is a river in Wales forming a tributary to the River Clwyd . The source of the river is sometimes said to be on the northern flank of Moel Seisiog , south-east of Llanrwst , at Ordnance Survey grid reference SH 853593 . However the river only receives the name Elwy at the village of Llangernyw , where three rivers , Afon Cledwen , Afon Collen and Afon Gallen , meet to form the Elwy . It flows eastwards through Llanfair Talhaiarn and a few miles downstream from this village it is joined by a tributary , the River Aled ( Afon Aled ) which has its source in Llyn Aled . After passing through Bont-newydd , the river turns northwards again and flows through St. Asaph ( Llanelwy or the church enclosure on the Elwy in Welsh ) . It joins the River Clwyd about half way between St. Asaph and Rhuddlan , and the waters of the two rivers can often be seen flowing side by side for several miles . A number of caves along the lower valley of the Elwy are of great archaeological interest and are considered one of the most important groups of Palaeolithic and later caves and rock shelters in Britain . In particular Pontnewydd Cave contained remains of Neanderthal man and is the most north-westerly site at which Neanderthal remains have been found . The Elwy is also well known for its sea trout ( sewin ) fishing , and also has a run of Atlantic Salmon . Rhyl and St Asaph Angling Association control 20 miles of river fishing on the rivers Elwy , Clwyd and Aled . In recent years including the recent 2017 season there have been good reported catches of wild brown trout most of which are returned unharmed on a voluntary catch and release system .

  "/wiki/Country_house": "An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside . Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house . This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city - hence , for these people , the term distinguished between town and country . However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive . While a ch\u00e2teau or a Schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building , a country house , similar to an Ansitz , is usually unfortified . If fortified , it is called a castle , but not all buildings with the name castle are fortified ( for example Highclere Castle ) .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
