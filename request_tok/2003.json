The road leading into the camp is named Kathmandu Road for the capital city of Nepal . Built as a self-contained complex due to security concerns to minimise movements into and out of the complex , it has its own shops , schools and even playgrounds for the younger children , which contingent commander Bruce M. Niven equates to being a township all on its own . Dwellers in the complex are not prohibited from leaving the camp or utilising services and facilities outside it . Throngs of school-going Nepalese children regularly leave and enter the camp everyday , wearing the uniforms of national schools . The camp 's close proximity to Bartley Secondary School has seen a significant number of Nepalese children being enrolled there , although they can also be found in schools much further away as the children become gradually assimilated into Singaporean society and culture . First Toa Payoh Primary School is one of the few primary schools where the Gurkha 's children are enrolled in . The surrounding commercial outlets thrive on business brought about by the Nepalese community based here , and it is a common sight to see officers doing their daily recreational runs around the major roads close to the camp . Phase 2B of the complex expansion commenced in 2001 costing S $ 42.2 million and added 93,568 m2 of largely residential space .

For about two decades , Brani Naval Base was the RSN 's only base . An expansion of the fleet in the early 1980s meant that more space was needed for the fleet and its shore infrastructure . However , this was not possible as the land around Brani was reserved for use by the port authority to develop container facilities . As a result , Tuas was selected as the site for a second naval base . Better utilisation of space at TNB resulted in two and a half times more berthing space than Brani , even though TNB only has a shoreline of 850 m ( 0.5 mi ) . Provision was also made for recreational facilities . Automation was incorporated into the design of TNB to reduce manpower requirements , such as mechanical ramps for the loading and unloading of vehicles and an automatic storage and retrieval system . It also has a floating dock which can lift 600 tonnes and transfer a ship from sea to land to facilitate repairs and maintenance . Currently , the missile corvettes , patrol vessels and mine counter-measures vessels are based at TNB .",
