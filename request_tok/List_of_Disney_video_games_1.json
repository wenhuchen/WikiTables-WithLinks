  "/wiki/Atari": "Atari ( /\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0ri/ ) is a brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972 , currently by Atari Interactive , a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari , SA . The original Atari , Inc. , founded in Sunnyvale , California in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney , was a pioneer in arcade games , home video game consoles , and home computers . The company 's products , such as Pong and the Atari 2600 , helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s . In 1984 , as a result of the video game crash of 1983 , the original Atari Inc. was split , and the arcade division was turned into Atari Games Inc. Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and brand name with appended text Games on arcade games , as well as rights to the original 1972-1984 arcade hardware properties . The Atari Consumer Electronics Division properties were in turn sold to Jack Tramiel 's Tramel Technology Ltd. , which then renamed itself to Atari Corporation . In 1996 , Atari Corporation reverse-merged with disk-drive manufacturer JT Storage ( JTS ) , becoming a division within the company . In 1998 , Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS , creating a new subsidiary , Atari Interactive . Infogrames Entertainment ( IESA ) bought Hasbro Interactive in 2001 and renamed it Infogrames Interactive , which intermittently published Atari branded titles . In 2003 , it renamed the division Atari Interactive . Another IESA division , Infogrames Inc. ( formerly GT Interactive ) , changed its name to Atari Inc. the same year , licensing the Atari name and logo from its fellow subsidiary . In 2008 , IESA completed its acquisition of Atari , Inc. 's outstanding stock , making it a wholly owned subsidiary . IESA renamed itself Atari , SA in 2009 .",
  "/wiki/Atari_2600": "The Atari 2600 , originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System or Atari VCS for short until November 1982 , is a home video game console from Atari , Inc . Released on September 11 , 1977 , it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges ( a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976 ) instead of dedicated hardware with games physically built into the unit . The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers , a conjoined pair of paddle controllers , and a game cartridge : initially Combat , and later Pac-Man . The Atari VCS launched with nine simple , low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges . The system found its killer app with its version of Taito 's Space Invaders in 1980 and became widely successful , leading to the creation of Activision and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco . By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983-84 , games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for , such as Pitfall ! and its scrolling sequel Pitfall II : Lost Caverns . Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600 , Pac-Man and E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , that became commercial failures and contributed to the video game crash of 1983 which ended the market relevance of the 2600 . Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel . In 1986 , the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backwards-compatible Atari 7800 , but these were not enough to turn things around , and ultimately it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry . Atari finally ended production of the Atari 2600 on January 1 , 1992 .",

  "/wiki/Donald_Duck's_Playground": "Donald Duck 's Playground is a 1984 Sierra educational game . The player takes the role of Donald Duck , whose job is to earn money so that he can buy playground items for his nephews . To do this , Donald can get himself a job in any of four different work places . Each job shift lasts from one to eight minutes , as the player wants , in which time Donald has to earn as much as he can . Donald Duck 's Playground was originally written for the Commodore 64 and subsequently ported to Sierra 's AGI interpreter for the Apple II , PC compatibles , Amiga , and Atari ST. A version for the TRS-80 Color Computer followed as well . The AGI engine had not been designed for this type of game and Al Lowe has described some aspects of porting it ( most notably the cash register section ) as ridiculous .",

Founded in 1979 as On-Line Systems , by Ken and Roberta Williams , Sierra is known primarily for its graphic adventure game series such as King 's Quest , Space Quest , Police Quest , Gabriel Knight , Leisure Suit Larry , and Quest for Glory . Sierra On-Line was acquired by CUC International in February 1996 and became part of CUC International 's newly established CUC Software ( sold and renamed multiple times until becoming Vivendi Games in 2006 ) . In June 2004 , after months of significant downsizing and restructuring at the company , Sierra Entertainment was disestablished as a company in August that year . Sierra continued to operate as a division of Vivendi Games through June 2008 , when Vivendi Games merged with Activision and formed Activision Blizzard , with Sierra becoming part of Activision Blizzard 's Activision subsidiary , though shut down later that year . The Sierra brand name was revived by Activision in 2014 to re-release former Sierra games and some independently-developed games .",
  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",
  "/wiki/Atari_ST": "The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family . The initial ST model , the 520ST , saw limited release in April-June 1985 and was widely available in July . The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bitmapped color GUI , using a version of Digital Research 's GEM released in February 1985 . The 1040ST , released in 1986 , is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US $ 1 . The Atari ST is part of a mid-1980s generation of home computers that have 16 or 32-bit processors , 256 KB or more of RAM , and mouse-controlled graphical user interfaces . This generation includes the Macintosh , Commodore Amiga , Apple IIGS , and , the most advanced true 32bit Acorn Archimedes . ST officially stands for Sixteen/Thirty-two , which refers to the Motorola 68000 's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals . The ST was sold with either Atari 's color monitor or the less expensive monochrome monitor . The system 's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest-resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor . In some markets , particularly Germany , the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and desktop publishing work . Thanks to its built-in MIDI ports , the ST enjoyed success for running music sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among amateurs and well-known musicians alike . The ST was superseded by the Atari STE , Atari TT , Atari MEGA STE , and Falcon computers .",

It was introduced by Jobs and Wozniak at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer , Inc . It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until Apple IIe production ceased in November 1993 . The Apple II marks Apple 's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer market - branded toward American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists .",
  "/wiki/Commodore_64": "The Commodore 64 , also known as the C64 or the CBM 64 , is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International ( first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , January 7-10 , 1982 ) . It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",
  "/wiki/IBM_PCjr": "The IBM PCjr ( read PC junior ) is a home computer that was produced and marketed by IBM from March 1984 to May 1985 . The PCjr was positioned as a complement to the very successful IBM Personal Computer ( PC ) , competing with other home computers such as the Apple II series and the Commodore 64 . It retains the IBM PC 's 8088 CPU and BIOS interface , but provides enhanced graphics and sound capabilities over the original IBM PC , ROM cartridge slots , joystick ports , and an infrared wireless keyboard . The PCjr supports expansion via sidecar modules , which are attached to the side of the unit . New software such as King 's Quest I showcased its PC gaming capabilities . Despite widespread anticipation , the PCjr 's launch was unsuccessful . IBM 's inexperience with the consumer market led to unclear positioning , with analysts believing that IBM was unsuccessful at justifying the PCjr 's higher cost in comparison to competitors such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II . It is only partially IBM compatible , so compatibility with existing PC software such as the killer app Lotus 1-2-3 was not guaranteed . The PCjr 's chiclet keyboard was widely criticized for its poor quality , with critics stating that it was unsuitable for extended use such as word processing . The PCjr 's expandability was also limited , and it was initially offered with up to 128 KB of RAM only , insufficient for many IBM PC programs . The New York Times stated that the PCjr was incapable of serious business computing , which is similar to stating that a pickup is incapable of carrying a serious business payload , or that zirconium is not as bright as diamond - it misses the question entirely . The real question is , are there enough consumers who can be convinced that they need the amount and type of processing that the PCjr provided .",

The series spawned a total of six distinct models : The CPC464 , CPC664 , and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market . The later 464plus and 6128plus , intended to prolong the system 's lifecycle with hardware updates , were considerably less successful , as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000 . The CPC models ' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU , complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM . Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device , either a compact cassette deck or 3 inch floppy disk drive . The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour , green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit 's power supply . Additionally , a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives , printers , and memory extensions , was available . The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software . The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor , its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users , which was reflected by a wide selection of application software .

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

As a fifth generation console , the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn . The PlayStation was the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units , which it had reached nine years after its initial launch . In July 2000 , a redesigned , slim version called the PS one was released , replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor , the PlayStation 2 .

The last PS one units were sold in late 2006 to early 2007 shortly after it was officially discontinued , for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch eleven years earlier . Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 - over eleven years after it had been released , and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3 . On 19 September 2018 , Sony unveiled the PlayStation Classic to mark the 24th anniversary of the original console .

The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium . The discs are in the miniDVD format and the system was not designed to play full-sized DVDs or audio CDs , unlike its competitors , and focused on gaming instead .

The GameCube uses composite video cables to display games on the television ; however , there are differences in the two GameCube models . The models produced before May 2004 also have the ability to use digital component AV cables and progressive scan and a second serial port . The nameplate on the top of the console with the words Nintendo GameCube can be removed . This model is known as DOL-001 . The previously mentioned features were removed in GameCube consoles produced between 2004-2007 ; the later model was known as DOL-101 . The newer model has updated firmware that disables Action Replay cheats and cheat codes ( a newer version was developed to circumvent this ) and the disc-reading laser was improved in many ways , though it is not as durable .",

The Dreamcast was Sega 's final home console , marking the end of the company 's 18 years in the console market . In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn , the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components , including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU .

Sales did not meet Sega 's expectations despite several price cuts , and the company continued to incur significant financial losses . After a change in leadership , Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31 , 2001 , withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher . 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide .
