Situated along the Wolf River , the park contains the farm and gristmill once owned by decorated World War I soldier Alvin C. York ( 1887-1964 ) , who lived in the Pall Mall area for his entire life . Along with the millhouse and milldam , the park includes York 's two-story house , York 's general store and post office , the Wolf River Cemetery ( where York and his family are buried ) , the Wolf River Methodist Church , the York Bible Institute , and various picnic facilities . Alvin York is one of the most celebrated soldiers in American history . He joined the pacifist Church of Christ in Christian Union in 1915 , and when drafted for service in World War I in 1917 , he applied for conscientious objector status , but was denied . On October 8 , 1918 , while on patrol along the Meuse-Argonne Front in France , York and his platoon wandered behind enemy lines and were caught in an ambush that left over half the platoon dead . York then led the handful of survivors in a counterattack that resulted in the capture of 132 German soldiers . York was awarded the Medal of Honor and became an instant celebrity , and upon his return to the United States he was barraged with offers for endorsements ( both commercial and political ) , movies , and books , most of which he initially rejected , believing it was wrong to profit from an act of war . The Nashville Rotary Club raised the funds to buy York his Pall Mall farm , which it presented to York in 1922 . After York 's death in 1964 , his widow donated the farm to the state of Tennessee ."
