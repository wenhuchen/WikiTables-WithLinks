  "/wiki/Angel_Mounds": "Angel Mounds State Historic Site ( 12 VG 1 ) , an expression of the Mississippian culture , is an archaeological site managed by the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites that includes more than 600 acres ( 240 hectares ) of land about 8 miles ( 13 km ) southeast of present-day Evansville , in Vanderburgh and Warrick County , Indiana . The large residential and agricultural community was constructed and inhabited from AD 1100 to AD 1450 and served as the political , cultural , and economic center of the Angel chiefdom . It extended within 120 miles ( 190 km ) of the Ohio River valley to the Green River in present-day Kentucky . The town had as many as 1,000 inhabitants at its peak and included a complex of thirteen earthen mounds , hundreds of home sites , a palisade ( stockade ) , and other structures . Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 , the property also includes an interpretive center , recreations of Mississippian structures , a replica of a 1939 Works Projects Administration archaeology laboratory , and a 500-acre ( 200-hectare ) area away from the archaeological site that is a nature preserve . The historic site continues to preserve and relate the story of pre-contact Middle Mississippian culture on the Ohio River . The site is named after the Angel family who in 1852 began purchasing farmland on which the archaeological site is located . In 1938 , the Indiana Historical Society , with funding from Eli Lilly , purchased 480 acres ( 190 hectares ) of property to preserve it and to use it for long-term archaeological excavation . From 1939 to 1942 , the Works Progress Administration employed more than 250 workers to excavate 120,000 square feet ( 11,000 m2 ) of the site , which resulted in the recording and processing of 2.3 million archaeological items . After excavation was temporarily halted during World War II , work resumed in 1945 as part of the Indiana University Archaeology Field School during the summer months . In 1946 , the Indiana Historical Society transferred ownership of the site to the State of Indiana , which manages the site through the Indiana State Museum . Archaeological research on Angel Mounds continues to be conducted through the Glenn A .",

Researched partly because of its small size , Ellerbusch has produced information that greatly increases present awareness of other small sites and of its culture 's overall patterns of settlement in the region .
