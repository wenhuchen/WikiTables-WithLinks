  "/wiki/Brookite": "Brookite is the orthorhombic variant of titanium dioxide , TiO2 , which occurs in many natural polymorphic forms ( minerals with the same composition but different structure ) . The International Mineralogical Association ( IMA ) recognizes four forms ; the others are akaogiite ( monoclinic ) , anatase ( tetragonal ) and rutile ( tetragonal ) . Brookite is rare compared to anatase and rutile and , like these forms , it exhibits photocatalytic activity . Brookite has a larger cell volume than either anatase or rutile , with 8 TiO2 groups per unit cell , compared with 4 for anatase and 2 for rutile . Iron Fe , tantalum Ta and niobium Nb are common impurities . It was named in 1825 by French mineralogist Armand L\u00e9vy for Henry James Brooke ( 1771-1857 ) , an English crystallographer , mineralogist and wool trader . Arkansite is a variety of brookite from Arkansas , US , that is also found in the Murunskii Massif , in the Aldan Shield of Eastern Siberia , Russia , where many other unusual minerals occur . At temperatures above about 750 \u00b0C , brookite will revert to the rutile structure .",
  "/wiki/Anatase": "Anatase is a metastable mineral form of titanium dioxide ( TiO2 ) . The mineral in natural forms is mostly encountered as a black solid , although the pure material is colorless or white . Two other naturally occurring mineral forms of TiO2 are known , brookite and rutile . Anatase is always found as small , isolated and sharply developed crystals , and like the thermodynamically stable rutile ( the more commonly occurring polymorph of titanium dioxide ) , it crystallizes in the tetragonal system . Anatase is metastable at all temperatures and pressures , with rutile being the equilibrium polymorph . Nevertheless , anatase is often the first titanium dioxide phase to form in many processes , due to its lower surface energy , with a transformation to rutile taking place at elevated temperatures . Although the degree of symmetry is the same for both anatase and rutile phases , there is no relation between the interfacial angles of the two minerals , except in the prism-zone of 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 . The common pyramid of anatase , parallel to the faces of which there are perfect cleavages , has an angle over the polar edge of 82\u00b09 ' , the corresponding angle of rutile being 56\u00b052\u00bd ' . Due to this steeper pyramid , in 1801 Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy named the mineral anatase - from the Greek anatasis ( extension ) , the vertical axis of the crystals being longer than in rutile . Additional important differences exist between the physical characters of anatase and rutile : the former is less hard ( 5.5-6 vs. 6-6.5 Mohs ) and dense ( specific gravity about 3.9 vs. 4.2 ) ; anatase is optically negative whereas rutile is positive ; and its luster is even more strongly adamantine or metallic-adamantine than that of rutile .",

  "/wiki/Malachite": "Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral , with the formula Cu2CO3 ( OH ) 2 . This opaque , green-banded mineral crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system , and most often forms botryoidal , fibrous , or stalagmitic masses , in fractures and deep , underground spaces , where the water table and hydrothermal fluids provide the means for chemical precipitation . Individual crystals are rare , but occur as slender to acicular prisms . Pseudomorphs after more tabular or blocky azurite crystals also occur .",
  "/wiki/Azurite": "Azurite is a soft , deep-blue copper mineral produced by weathering of copper ore deposits . During the early 19th century , it was also known as chessylite , after the type locality at Chessy-les-Mines near Lyon , France . The mineral , a carbonate with the chemical formula Cu3 ( CO3 ) 2 ( OH ) 2 , has been known since ancient times , and was mentioned in Pliny the Elder 's Natural History under the Greek name kuanos ( \u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 : deep blue , root of English cyan ) and the Latin name caeruleum . Since antiquity , azurite 's exceptionally deep and clear blue has been associated with low-humidity desert and winter skies . The modern English name of the mineral reflects this association , since both azurite and azure are derived via Arabic from the Persian lazhward ( \u0644\u0627\u0698\u0648\u0631\u062f ) , an area known for its deposits of another deep-blue stone , lapis lazuli ( stone of azure ) .",
  "/wiki/Obsidian": "Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock . Obsidian is produced when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth . It is commonly found within the margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows , where the chemical composition ( high silica content ) causes a high viscosity , which , upon rapid cooling , results in a natural glass forming from the lava . The inhibition of atomic diffusion through this highly viscous lava explains the lack of crystal growth . Obsidian is hard , brittle , and amorphous ; it therefore fractures with sharp edges . In the past , it was used to manufacture cutting and piercing tools , and it has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades .",

As early as the 7th millennium BCE , lapis lazuli was mined in the Sar-i Sang mines , in Shortugai , and in other mines in Badakhshan province in northeast Afghanistan . Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation ( 3300-1900 BCE ) , and lapis beads have been found at Neolithic burials in Mehrgarh , the Caucasus , and as far away from Afghanistan as Mauritania . It was used in the funeral mask of Tutankhamun ( 1341-1323 BCE ) . By the end of the Middle Ages , lapis lazuli began to be exported to Europe , where it was ground into powder and made into ultramarine , the finest and most expensive of all blue pigments . It was used by some of the most important artists of the Renaissance and Baroque , including Masaccio , Perugino , Titian and Vermeer , and was often reserved for the clothing of the central figures of their paintings , especially the Virgin Mary .",

  "/wiki/Fluorite": "Fluorite ( also called fluorspar ) is the mineral form of calcium fluoride , CaF2 . It belongs to the halide minerals . It crystallizes in isometric cubic habit , although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon . The Mohs scale of mineral hardness , based on scratch hardness comparison , defines value 4 as Fluorite . Pure fluorite is transparent , both in visible and ultraviolet light , but impurities usually make it a colorful mineral and the stone has ornamental and lapidary uses . Industrially , fluorite is used as a flux for smelting , and in the production of certain glasses and enamels . The purest grades of fluorite are a source of fluoride for hydrofluoric acid manufacture , which is the intermediate source of most fluorine-containing fine chemicals . Optically clear transparent fluorite lenses have low dispersion , so lenses made from it exhibit less chromatic aberration , making them valuable in microscopes and telescopes . Fluorite optics are also usable in the far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared ranges , where conventional glasses are too absorbent for use .",
