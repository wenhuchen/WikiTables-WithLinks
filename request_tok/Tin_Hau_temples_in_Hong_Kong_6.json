The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of invisible forces that bind the universe , earth , and humanity together , known as qi . Historically , feng shui was widely used to orient buildings - often spiritually significant structures such as tombs , but also dwellings and other structures - in an auspicious manner .

The Chinese name Guanyin is short for Guanshiyin , which means [ The One Who ] Perceives the Sounds of the World .

Guanyin is often referred to as the most widely beloved Buddhist Divinity with miraculous powers to assist all those who pray to her , as is said in the Lotus Sutra and Karandavyuha Sutra .
