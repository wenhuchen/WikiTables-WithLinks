As with nearly all varieties of genre classification , the matter of a specific game 's genre is open to subjective interpretation . An individual game may belong to several genres at once .",

Interactive Entertainment . Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman and written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini , Arkham Asylum was inspired by the long-running comic book mythos . In the game 's main storyline , Batman battles his archenemy , the Joker , who instigates an elaborate plot to seize control of Arkham Asylum , trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes , and threaten the fictional Gotham City with hidden bombs . Most of the game 's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe ; Kevin Conroy , Mark Hamill , and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman , the Joker , and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively . The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman 's combat and stealth abilities , detective skills , and gadgets that can be used in combat and exploration . Batman can freely move around the Arkham Asylum facility , interacting with characters and undertaking missions , and unlocking new areas by progressing through the main story or obtaining new equipment . The player is able to complete side missions away from the main story to unlock additional content and collectible items . Combat focuses on chaining attacks together against numerous foes while avoiding damage , while stealth allows Batman to conceal himself around an area , using gadgets and the environment to silently eliminate enemies . Development began at Rocksteady Studios in May 2007 , with a 40-person team that expanded to 60 people by the project 's conclusion after approximately 21 months . Among others , the game design was inspired by Batman-penned works of Neal Adams and Frank Miller , and Grant Morrison 's Arkham Asylum : A Serious House on Serious Earth graphic novel . Built on Unreal Engine 3 , Arkham Asylum 's production underwent several variations , refining both gameplay such as the combat system , and the central story , resulting in the removal of plot elements and some of Batman 's main enemies , who did not fit the tone of the rest of the game . Rocksteady began developing ideas for a sequel months before Arkham Asylum 's completion , hiding hints to the sequel within the game .",

  "/wiki/Action-adventure_game": "Action-adventure is a video game genre that combines core elements from both the action game and adventure game genres . With the decline of the adventure game genre from mainstream popularity in the early 2000s , the use of the term ( and the hybrid term action-adventure ) has been more liberal . It is not uncommon for gamers to apply the term adventure or action to describe the genre of fiction to which a game belongs , and not the gameplay itself . Action-adventure is a hybrid genre , and thus the definition is very inclusive , leading it to be perhaps the broadest genre of video games , and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres . Typically , pure adventure games have situational problems for the player to solve , with very little or no action . If there is action , it is generally confined to isolated minigames . Pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge the reflexes . Therefore , action-adventure games engage both reflexes and problem-solving , in both violent and non-violent situations .",

  "/wiki/First-person_shooter": "First-person shooter ( FPS ) is a video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective ; that is , the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist . The genre shares common traits with other shooter games , which in turn makes it fall under the heading action game . Since the genre 's inception , advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development , and multiplayer gaming has been integral . The first-person shooter genre has been traced as far back as Maze War , development of which began in 1973 , and 1974 's Spasim . Later , and after more playful titles like MIDI Maze in 1987 , the genre coalesced into a more violent form with 1992 's Wolfenstein 3D , which has been credited with creating the genre 's basic archetype upon which subsequent titles were based . One such title , and the progenitor of the genre 's wider mainstream acceptance and popularity , was Doom , one of the most influential games in this genre ; for some years , the term Doom clone was used to designate this genre due to Doom 's influence .

This is distinguished from turn-based strategy ( TBS ) , in which all players take turns when playing .

In a typical RTS , it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game . This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources .

More specifically , the typical game of the RTS genre features resource gathering , base building , in-game technological development and indirect control of units . The term real-time strategy was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s . The tasks a player must perform to succeed at an RTS can be very demanding , and complex user interfaces have evolved to cope with the challenge .

  "/wiki/4X": "4X is a genre of strategy-based video and board games in which players control an empire and eXplore , eXpand , eXploit , and eXterminate . The term was coined by Alan Emrich in his September 1993 preview of Master of Orion for Computer Gaming World . Since then , others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and design . 4X computer games are noted for their deep , complex gameplay . Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development , as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy . Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of micromanagement needed to sustain an empire increases as the empire grows . 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons , and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement , with varying degrees of success . The earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from board games and 1970s text-based computer games . The first 4X computer games were turn-based , but real-time 4X games are not uncommon . Many 4X computer games were published in the mid-1990s , but were later outsold by other types of strategy games . Sid Meier 's Civilization is an important example from this formative era , and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre . In the new millennium , several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful .",

  "/wiki/Sim_racing": "Sim ( simulated ) racing is the collective term for computer software that attempts to accurately simulate auto racing , complete with real-world variables such as fuel usage , damage , tire wear and grip , and suspension settings . To be competitive in sim racing , a driver must understand all aspects of car handling that make real-world racing so difficult , such as threshold braking , how to maintain control of a car as the tires lose traction , and how properly to enter and exit a turn without sacrificing speed . It is this level of difficulty that distinguishes sim racing from arcade driving games where real-world variables are taken out of the equation and the principal objective is to create a sense of speed as opposed to a sense of realism . In general , sim racing applications , such as rFactor , Grand Prix Legends , NASCAR Racing , Race 07 , F1 Challenge '99-'02 , Assetto Corsa , GTR 2 , Project CARS , iRacing and Richard Burns Rally are less popular than arcade-style games , mainly because much more skill and practice is required to master them . An exception is Gran Turismo , which has achieved worldwide fame , as have simcade titles such as Forza Motorsport , Colin McRae Rally , F1 '09-'19 and NASCAR Heat Evolution . Also , because of the demands on the computer system , race sims require faster computers to run effectively , as well as a somewhat costly steering wheel and pedals for the throttle and brakes . Most arcade-style driving games can be played with a simple joystick controller or even a mouse and keyboard . With the development of online racing capability , the ability to drive against human opponents as opposed to computer AI is the closest many will come to driving real cars on a real track . Even those who race in real-world competition use simulations for practice or for entertainment . With continued development of the physics engine software that forms the basis of these sims , as well as improved hardware ( providing tactile feedback ) , the experience is becoming more realistic .",
