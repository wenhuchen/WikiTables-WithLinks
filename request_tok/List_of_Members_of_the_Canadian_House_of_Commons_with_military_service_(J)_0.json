The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada 's history , holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result , it is sometimes referred to as Canada 's natural governing party . The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice . In the 2015 federal election , the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election , winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats , gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons .

This second incarnation was considerably smaller than the first because Kootenay district was now in a different riding . In 1903 , the riding of Kootenay was split off from what had been the original Yale riding . The new Yale riding excluded the Town of Yale , and when it was reconstituted , coincided with the provincial Okanagan riding except for the city of Salmon Arm . The new incarnation of Yale lasted until the 1952 , when the Yale name vanished from the Commons and the Okanagan ridings , Okanagan Boundary and Okanagan - Revelstoke were created . The old core area around the town of historic and once-important Yale , which has long since became depopulated by being bypassed by massive growth elsewhere , was attached to the Fraser Valley riding , then to its successor Fraser Valley East , and then to today 's Chilliwack - Fraser Canyon . It was not in the second incarnation of the Yale riding when it was reconstituted in 1914 .",
  "/wiki/British_Army": "The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom , a part of British Armed Forces . As of 2019 [ update ] , the British Army comprises just over 79,300 trained regular ( full-time ) personnel and just over 27,200 trained reserve ( part-time ) personnel . The modern British Army traces back to 1707 , with an antecedent in the English Army that was created during the Restoration in 1660 . The term British Army was adopted in 1707 after the Acts of Union between England and Scotland . Members of the British Army swear allegiance to the monarch as their commander-in-chief , but the Bill of Rights of 1689 requires parliamentary consent for the Crown to maintain a peacetime standing army . Therefore , Parliament approves the army by passing an Armed Forces Act at least once every five years . The army is administered by the Ministry of Defence and commanded by the Chief of the General Staff . The British Army has seen action in major wars between the world 's great powers , including the Seven Years ' War , the Napoleonic Wars , the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars . Britain 's victories in these decisive wars allowed it to influence world events and establish itself as one of the world 's leading military and economic powers . Since the end of the Cold War , the British Army has been deployed to a number of conflict zones , often as part of an expeditionary force , a coalition force or part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation .",
