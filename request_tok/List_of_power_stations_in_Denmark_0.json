Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales . He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there . There has been human settlement in the Odense area for over 4,000 years , although the name was not mentioned in writing until 988 , and by 1070 , it had already grown into a thriving city . Canute IV of Denmark , generally considered to be the last Viking king , was murdered by unruly peasants in Odense 's St Alban 's Priory on 10 July 1086 . Although the city was burned in 1249 following a royal rivalry , it quickly recovered and flourished as a centre of commerce in the Middle Ages . After a period of decline , large-scale plans for development were made during the 18th century , which led to the rebuilding of Odense Palace and the building of a canal to the Port of Odense , facilitating trade . In 1865 , one of the largest railway terminals in Denmark was built , further increasing the population and commerce , and by 1900 , Odense had reached a population of 35,000 .

The station is to be used as a hub for distributing district heating from the coming Apple data center near Foulum and Tjele . Consultants calculate that the best economy for Viborg 's district heating is a system where Apple 's cooling water is used to provide heat for 7 MWe heat pumps at the data center delivering 55 MJ/s of heating ( and cooling for Apple ) , with an overall Coefficient of performance of 8 . The transmission water temperature is raised from 30 to 50 \u00b0C and then pipelined 10 km to Viborg , where further heat pumps raise ( and keep ) the local heat to 60 \u00b0C .
