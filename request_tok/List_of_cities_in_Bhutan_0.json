It is situated in the western central part of Bhutan , and the surrounding valley is one of Bhutan 's dzongkhags , the Thimphu District . The ancient capital city of Punakha was replaced as capital by Thimphu in 1955 , and in 1961 Thimphu was declared as the capital of the Kingdom of Bhutan by the 3rd Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuck . The city extends in a north-south direction on the west bank of the valley formed by the Raid\u0101k River , which is known as the Wang Chuu or Thimphu Chuu in Bhutan . Thimphu is the fifth highest capital in the world by altitude and ranges in altitude from 2,248 metres ( 7,375 feet ) to 2,648 metres ( 8,688 feet ) . Unusually for a capital city , Thimphu does not have its own airport , but relies on the Paro Airport connected by road some 54 kilometres ( 34 miles ) away . Thimphu , as the political and economic center of Bhutan , has a dominant agricultural and livestock base , which contributes 45% of the country 's GNP . Tourism , though a contributor to the economy , is strictly regulated , maintaining a balance between the traditional , development and modernization . Thimphu contains most of the important political buildings in Bhutan , including the National Assembly of the newly-formed parliamentary democracy and Dechencholing Palace , the official residence of the King , located to the north of the city . Thimphu is co-ordinated by the Thimphu Structure Plan , an Urban Development Plan which evolved in 1998 with the objective of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley . This development is ongoing with financial assistance from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank . The culture of Bhutan is fully reflected in Thimphu in literature , religion , customs , and national dress code , the monastic practices of the monasteries , music , and dance , and in the media .",
