  "/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club": "Somerset County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales .

The club 's limited overs team was formerly named the Somerset Sabres , but is now known only as Somerset . Somerset 's early history is complicated by arguments about its status . It is generally regarded as a minor county from its foundation in 1875 until 1890 , apart from the 1882 to 1885 seasons when it is considered by substantial sources to have been an unofficial first-class team , holding important match status . There are , however , two matches involving W. G. Grace in 1879 and 1881 which are considered first-class by some authorities . In 1891 , Somerset joined the County Championship , which had just become an officially recognised competition , and has important match status from 1891 to 1894 . The county is classified as an official first-class team from 1895 by Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) and the County Championship clubs ; classified as a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963 ; and classified as a senior Twenty20 team since 2003 . Somerset have never won the County Championship , their highest finish being second , which they achieved in 2001 , 2010 , 2012 , 2016 , 2018 and 2019 .
