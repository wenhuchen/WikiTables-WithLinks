Alpha Chi Alpha is a member of Dartmouth 's Greek system , which currently has fourteen fraternities , nine sororities and three co-ed undergraduate houses that fall under the umbrella of the Greek system . Alpha Chi Alpha is referred to among Dartmouth students as simply Alpha Chi . The house , which is located at 13 Webster Avenue on the Dartmouth College campus , is a college-owned fraternity , meaning that the brothers do not own the land or house . This also means that Dartmouth College paid for $ 1.3 million in renovations ( done during the summer of 2004 ) , which included the razing of the Barn structure that was used as social space by the brothers of Alpha Chi to make way for a new expanded basement and main floor area which were to act as a new social space for the fraternity . The house is nicknamed the Magic Green Cottage and the Cheese Lodge by its members and has the unique location on fraternity row directly across from the President 's house . The green-shingled structure includes a sand volleyball court adjacent to the house . Its perennial pledges are easily recognized by their sirens ( red , baseball cap-like headwear ) , which they wear for the duration of their pledge term . The house was begun in March 1917 , when twelve Dartmouth men founded the Epsilon Kappa Alpha fraternity . In 1919 , this lodge became the Phi Nu chapter of the national fraternity , Alpha Chi Rho . The house was located in the back of the present White Church . Alpha Chi Rho flourished at Dartmouth for about ten years .",

  "/wiki/Doric_temple": "The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture ; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian . The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns . Originating in the western Dorian region of Greece , it is the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders , though still with complex details in the entablature above . The Greek Doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced , and had no base , dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood . The capital was a simple circular form , with some mouldings , under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions , but later more restrained . Above a plain architrave , the complexity comes in the frieze , where the two features originally unique to the Doric , the triglyph and guttae , are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples . In stone they are purely ornamental . The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these , and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament , as well as often using plain columns . More often they used versions of the Tuscan order , elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers , which is in effect a simplified Doric , with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards ; often earlier Greek versions were used , with wider columns and no bases to them . Since at least Vitruvius , it has been customary for writers to associate the Doric with masculine virtues ( the Ionic representing the feminine ) . It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use ."
