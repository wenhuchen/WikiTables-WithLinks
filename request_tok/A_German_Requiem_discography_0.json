He was general manager at the company 's founding , became president in 1930 , and remained active , as chairman of the board , until the end of 1969 . During the 1970s , RCA 's seemingly impregnable stature began to weaken as it attempted to expand from its main focus of the development and marketing of consumer electronics into a diversified multinational conglomerate . The company suffered enormous financial losses in the mainframe computer industry and other failed projects such as the CED videodisc . Though the company rebounded by the mid 1980s , RCA was reacquired by General Electric in 1986 , which over the next few years liquidated most of the corporation 's assets .
