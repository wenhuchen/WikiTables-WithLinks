Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",

Chechen militants were blamed for the bombings , but denied responsibility , along with Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov . A suspicious device resembling those used in these bombings was found and defused in an apartment block in the Russian city of Ryazan on 22 September . The next day , Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan and ordered the air bombing of Grozny , which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War . Three FSB agents who had planted the devices at Ryazan were arrested by the local police .

Much of the city was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake , though it was rebuilt afterwards as a model Soviet city . It was the fourth-largest city of the Soviet Union at the time , after Moscow , Leningrad and Kiev .

Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal .

The bombing killed 29 people ( including a woman pregnant with twins ) and injured some 220 others , making it the deadliest single incident of the Troubles in Northern Ireland . Telephoned warnings had been sent almost 40 minutes beforehand but were inaccurate , and police had inadvertently moved people toward the bomb . The bombing caused outrage both locally and internationally , spurred on the Northern Ireland peace process and dealt a severe blow to the dissident Irish republican campaign . The Real IRA denied that the bomb was intended to kill civilians and apologised ; shortly after , the group declared a ceasefire . The victims included people of many backgrounds and ages : Protestants , Catholics , six teenagers , six children , a woman pregnant with twins , two Spanish tourists and others on a day trip from the Republic of Ireland . Both unionists and Irish nationalists were killed and injured . As a result of the bombing , new anti-terrorism laws were swiftly instated by both the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland . It has been alleged that the British , Irish and US intelligence agencies had information which could have prevented the bombing , most of which came from double agents inside the Real IRA , but this information was not given to the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) . In 2008 , it was revealed that British intelligence agency GCHQ was monitoring conversations between the bombers as the bomb was being driven into Omagh .

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing": "The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , United States on April 19 , 1995 . Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols , the bombing happened at 9:02 am and killed at least 168 people , injured more than 680 others , and destroyed one-third of the building . The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius , shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings , and destroyed or burned 86 cars , causing an estimated $ 652 million worth of damage . Local , state , federal , and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of the bombing , and substantial donations were received from across the country . The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces , consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations . Until the September 11 , 2001 attacks , the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States , and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country 's history . Within 90 minutes of the explosion , McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession . Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack ; Nichols was arrested , and within days , both were charged . Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices . McVeigh , a veteran of the Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer , had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building . His co-conspirator , Nichols , had assisted with the bomb 's preparation . Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993 , McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas .",

Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",
  "/wiki/Jew": "Jews or Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and a nation , originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah . Jewish ethnicity , nationhood , and religion are strongly interrelated , as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people , while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance . Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE , in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel . The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE ( Late Bronze Age ) . The Israelites , as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews ' . Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail , the experience of diaspora life , from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant , to Assyrian captivity and exile , to Babylonian captivity and exile , to Seleucid Imperial rule , to the Roman occupation and exile , and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter , became a major feature of Jewish history , identity and memory . Prior to World War II , the worldwide Jewish population reached a peak of 16.7 million , representing around 0.7% of the world population at that time . Approximately 6 million Jews were systematically murdered during the Holocaust . Since then the population has slowly risen again , and as of 2018 [ update ] was estimated at 14.6-17.8 million by the Berman Jewish DataBank , less than 0.2% of the total world population . [ note 1 ] The modern State of Israel is the only country where Jews form a majority of the population . It defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state in the Basic Laws , Human Dignity and Liberty in particular , which is based on the Declaration of Independence .",

The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata , on the South American continent 's southeastern coast . Buenos Aires can be translated as fair winds or good airs , but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century , by the use of the original name Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre , named after the Madonna of Bonaria in Sardinia . The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation , which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts , constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas , with a population of around 15.6 million . The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province 's capital ; rather , it is an autonomous district . In 1880 , after decades of political infighting , Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province . The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores ; both are now neighborhoods of the city . The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy , hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ( Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires ; CABA ) . Its citizens first elected a chief of government ( i.e . mayor ) in 1996 ; previously , the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic . Buenos Aires ' quality of life was ranked 91st in the world in 2018 , being one of the best in Latin America . In 2012 , it was the most visited city in South America , and the second-most visited city of Latin America ( behind Mexico City ) .",

The bombing is Argentina 's deadliest terrorist attack to date . Argentina is home to a Jewish community of 230,000 , the largest in Latin America and sixth in the world outside Israel ( see Demographics of Argentina ) . Over the years , the case has been marked by accusations of cover-ups . All suspects in the local connection ( among them , many members of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police ) were found to be not guilty in September 2004 . In August 2005 , federal judge Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano , in charge of the case , was impeached and removed from his post on a charge of serious irregularities due to mishandling of the investigation . In 2005 , Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio , who would later become Pope Francis , was the first public personality to sign a petition for justice in the AMIA bombing case . He was one of the signatories on a document called 85 victims , 85 signatures as part of the bombing 's 11th anniversary . On 25 October 2006 , Argentine prosecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcelo Mart\u00ednez Burgos formally accused the government of Iran of directing the bombing , and the Hezbollah militia of carrying it out . According to the prosecution 's claims in 2006 , Argentina had been targeted by Iran after Buenos Aires ' decision to suspend a nuclear technology transfer contract to Tehran . This has been disputed because the contract was never terminated and Iran and Argentina were negotiating on restoration of full cooperation on all agreements from early 1992 until 1994 , when the bombing occurred . In 2015 Alberto Nisman filed a 300-page document accusing former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of covering up Iran 's role in the incident .",

Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested since the Middle Bronze Age , while the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age . The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century CE , the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 .",
