  "/wiki/Hindustani_language": "Hindustani , also known as Hindi-Urdu and historically known as Hindi , Hindavi , Urdu , Dehlavi , and Rekhta , is the lingua franca of Northern India and Pakistan . According to the Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World , Hindustani is an Indo-Aryan language , deriving its base primarily from the Western Hindi dialect of Delhi , also known as Khariboli . Hindustani is a pluricentric language , with two standardised registers , Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu . The term Hindustani was used in the colonial period ; the term Hindi-Urdu has been in common use among scholars since 1980 . Also according to the Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World , Hindustani as a colloquial speech developed over almost seven centuries from 1100 to 1800 . The Muslims conquered northern India from the 10th to the 13th centuries and settled down in the country , bringing with them their Persian language and culture . This mixing of cultures provided the contact situation for the emergence of Hindustani as a lingua franca . According to linguist Colin P. Masica , the term Hindustani was much in vogue during Independence movement as expression of national unity ; after Partition in 1947 and subsequent linguistic polarization it fell into disfavor According to Encyclopaedia Britannica , 1961 , The everyday speech of well over 50,000,000 persons of all communities in the north of India and in West Pakistan is the expression of a common language , Hindustani . The Hindi film industry has employed Hindustani which included many Urdu and Persian words ; Bollywood 's screenplays are written in Hindustani . The language 's core vocabulary is derived from Prakrit ( a descendant of Sanskrit ) , with substantial loanwords from Persian and Arabic ( via Persian ) . The number of speakers can only be estimated . Ethnologue reports that , as of 2019 , Hindi and Urdu together constitute the 3rd-most-spoken language in the world after English and Mandarin , with 785 million native and second-language speakers , though this includes millions who self-reported their language as 'Hindi ' on the Indian census but speak a number of other Hindi languages than Hindustani .",

Urdu is the official national language , and lingua franca , of Pakistan . In India , it is one of 22 constitutionally recognised official languages , having official status in the five states of Telangana , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , as well as the national capital territory of Delhi . As both registers are composed of the same Indo-Aryan vocabulary base , colloquial Urdu is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi , with the two registers being grouped together as Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu . With respect to literary vocabulary , however , formal Urdu draws heavily from Persian vocabulary and requires knowledge of some simple Persian grammatical structures , while formal Hindi heavily draws from Sanskrit for its formal and technical vocabulary . Later , Urdu became the official language of government in northern and northwest British India , along with English , from 1837 onwards in place of Persian , which had been used by various Indo-Islamic empires as their language of government . Religious , social , and political factors arose during the colonial period that advocated for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi , leading to the Hindi-Urdu controversy . According to Nationalencyklopedin 's 2010 estimates , Urdu is the 21st most spoken first language in the world , with approximately 66 million who speak it as their native language . According to Ethnologue 's 2018 estimates , Urdu , is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world , with 170 million total speakers , including those who speak it as a second language . If grouped along with Hindi , Hindustani would be the 3rd most spoken language in the world , with approximately 329.1 million native speakers , and 697.4 million total speakers of both Urdu and Hindi .",

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

A language of the Malays , it is spoken by 290 million people across the Strait of Malacca , including the coasts of the Malay Peninsula of Malaysia and the eastern coast of Sumatra in Indonesia and has been established as a native language of part of western coastal Sarawak and West Kalimantan in Borneo . It is also used as a trading language in the southern Philippines , including the southern parts of the Zamboanga Peninsula , the Sulu Archipelago and the southern predominantly Muslim-inhabited municipalities of Bataraza and Balabac in Palawan . As the Bahasa Kebangsaan or Bahasa Nasional ( national language ) of several states , Standard Malay has various official names . In Malaysia , it is designated as either Bahasa Malaysia ( Malaysian language ) or Bahasa Melayu ( Malay language ) . In Singapore and Brunei , it is called Bahasa Melayu ( Malay language ) and in Indonesia , an autonomous normative variety called Bahasa Indonesia ( Indonesian language ) is designated the Bahasa Persatuan/Pemersatu ( unifying language/lingua franca ) . However , in areas of central to southern Sumatra where vernacular varieties of Malay are indigenous , Indonesians refer to it as Bahasa Melayu and consider it one of their regional languages . Standard Malay , also called Court Malay , was the literary standard of the pre-colonial Malacca and Johor Sultanates , and so the language is sometimes called Malacca , Johor or Riau Malay ( or various combinations of those names ) to distinguish it from the various other Malayan languages . According to Ethnologue 16 , several of the Malayan varieties they currently list as separate languages , including the Orang Asli varieties of Peninsular Malay , are so closely related to standard Malay that they may prove to be dialects . There are also several Malay trade and creole languages which are based on a lingua franca derived from Classical Malay as well as Macassar Malay , which appears to be a mixed language .",

The term Indonesian is primarily associated with the national standard dialect ( bahasa baku ) . However , in a more loose sense , it also encompasses the various local varieties spoken throughout the Indonesian archipelago . Standard Indonesian is confined mostly to formal situations , existing in a diglossic relationship with vernacular Malay varieties , which are commonly used for daily communication .

In 2018 , South Africa legalized the teaching of Swahili in South African schools as an optional subject to begin in 2020 . A significant fraction of Swahili vocabulary derives from Arabic , in part conveyed by Arabic-speaking Muslim inhabitants .

Mount Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , is in northeastern Tanzania . Many important hominid fossils have been found in Tanzania , such as 6-million-year-old Pliocene hominid fossils . The genus Australopithecus ranged all over Africa 4 to 2 million years ago ; and the oldest remains of the genus Homo are found near Lake Olduvai . Following the rise of Homo erectus 1.8 million years ago , humanity spread all over the Old World , and later in the New World and Australia under the species Homo sapiens . Homo sapiens also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity . One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing , the Hadzabe , appears to have originated in Tanzania , and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire , medicine , and lived in caves , much like Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis who lived in the same region before them . Later in the Stone and Bronze Age , prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included Southern Cushitic speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia ; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago ; and the Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , who originated from the present-day South Sudan-Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . : page 18 These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas .

It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts .

The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries .

  "/wiki/Tajik_language": "Tajik or Tajiki ( Tajik : \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0301\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u04b7\u0438\u043a\u04e3\u0301 , zaboni tojik\u012b , [ za\u02c8b\u0254ni t\u0254d\u0292i\u02c8ki ] ) , also called Tajiki Persian ( Tajik : \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0301\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u04b7\u0438\u043a\u04e3\u0301 , forsii tojik\u012b , [ f\u0254r\u02c8siji t\u0254d\u0292i\u02c8ki ] ) and Tadzhik , is the variety of Persian spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by Tajiks . It is closely related to neighboring Dari Persian with which it forms a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties . Since the beginning of the twentieth century and independence of Tajikistan from Soviet Union , Tajik has been considered by a number of writers and researchers to be a variety of Persian . [ clarification needed ] The popularity of this conception of Tajik as a variety of Persian was such that , during the period in which Tajik intellectuals were trying to establish Tajik as a language separate from Persian language , Sadriddin Ayni , who was a prominent intellectual and educator , made a statement that Tajik was not a bastardized dialect of Persian . The issue of whether Tajik and Persian are to be considered two dialects of a single language or two discrete languages has political sides to it ( see Perry 1996 ) . By way of Early New Persian , Tajiki Persian , like Iranian Persian and Dari Persian , is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , the language of the Achaemenids ( 550-330 BC ) . Tajik is the official language of Tajikistan . In Afghanistan ( where the Tajik people minority forms the principal part of the wider Persophone population ) , this language is less influenced by Turkic languages , is regarded as a form of Dari and as such has co-official language status . The Tajik of Tajikistan has diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and Iran due to political borders , geographical isolation , the standardization process and the influence of Russian and neighboring Turkic languages . The standard language is based on the northwestern dialects of Tajik ( region of old major city of Samarqand ) , which have been somewhat influenced by the neighboring Uzbek language as a result of geographical proximity . Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary , pronunciation and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persophone world , in part due to its relative isolation in the mountains of Central Asia .",

In 1928 , as one of Atat\u00fcrk 's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey , the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet . The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination . The basic word order of Turkish is subject-object-verb . Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender . The language makes usage of honorifics and has a strong T-V distinction which distinguishes varying levels of politeness , social distance , age , courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee .

Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I .

The earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC . Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia , and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world . Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC . As a strategic location in the Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several major powers , including the empires of the Assyrians , Egyptians and Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

Recognised only by Turkey , Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus . Northern Cyprus extends from the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in the northeast to Morphou Bay , Cape Kormakitis and its westernmost point , the Kokkina exclave in the west . Its southernmost point is the village of Louroujina . A buffer zone under the control of the United Nations stretches between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the island and divides Nicosia , the island 's largest city and capital of both sides . A coup d'\u00e9tat in 1974 , performed as part of an attempt to annex the island to Greece , prompted the Turkish invasion of Cyprus . This resulted in the eviction of much of the north 's Greek Cypriot population , the flight of Turkish Cypriots from the south , and the partitioning of the island , leading to a unilateral declaration of independence by the north in 1983 . Due to its lack of recognition , Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic , political and military support . Attempts to reach a solution to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful . The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus . While its presence is supported and approved by the TRNC government , the Republic of Cyprus , the European Union as a whole , and the international community regard it as an occupation force , and its presence has been denounced in several United Nations Security Council resolutions .

In AD 257 , [ clarification needed ] Marinus , according to legend , participated in the reconstruction of Rimini 's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates . Marinus then went on to found an independent monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301 ; thus , San Marino lays claim to be the oldest extant sovereign state as well as the oldest constitutional republic . The nation is governed by the Constitution of San Marino ( Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini ) , a series of six books written in Latin in the late 16th century , that dictate the country 's political system , among other matters . San Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect . The country 's economy mainly relies on finance , industry , [ which ? ]",
  "/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta": "The Sovereign Military Order of Malta ( SMOM ) , officially the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem , of Rhodes and of Malta ( Italian : Sovrano Militare Ordine Ospedaliero di San Giovanni di Gerusalemme di Rodi e di Malta ; Latin : Supremus Militaris Ordo Hospitalarius Sancti Ioannis Hierosolymitani Rhodiensis et Melitensis ) , commonly known as the Order of Malta , is a Catholic lay religious order , traditionally of military , chivalric and noble nature . It has been called the smallest sovereign state in the world , though it is not recognized as one by the United Nations . SMOM claims continuity with the Knights Hospitaller , a chivalric order that was founded c. 1099 by the Blessed Gerard in medieval Jerusalem . In terms of international law , it is an establishment of the 19th century , recognized at the Congress of Verona of 1822 , and since 1834 headquartered in Palazzo Malta in Rome . The order is led by an elected Prince and Grand Master . Its motto is Tuitio fidei et obsequium pauperum ( 'defence of the faith and assistance to the poor ' ) . The order venerates the Virgin Mary as its patroness , under the title of Our Lady of Mount Philermos . The headquarters of the Order of Saint John had been located in Malta from 1530 until 1798 . It was technically a vassal of the Kingdom of Sicily , holding Malta in exchange for a nominal fee , but declared independence in 1753 . It was expelled from Malta under the French occupation in 1798 and , from 1805 to 1812 , much of its possessions in Protestant Europe were confiscated , resulting in the fragmentation of the order into a number of Protestant branches , since 1961 united under the umbrella of the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem . The Congress of Vienna of 1815 confirmed the loss of Malta , but the Congress of Verona in 1822 guaranteed the continued existence of the Catholic order as a sovereign entity . The seat of the order was moved to Ferrara in 1826 and to Rome in 1834 , the interior of Palazzo Malta being considered extraterritorial sovereign territory of the order .",
  "/wiki/Vatican_City": "Vatican City ( /\u02c8v\u00e6t\u026ak\u0259n/ ( listen ) ) , officially Vatican City State ( Italian : Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano ; [ d ] Latin : Status Civitatis Vaticanae ) , [ e ] [ f ] is an independent city-state enclaved within Rome , Italy . Established with the Lateran Treaty ( 1929 ) , it is distinct from , yet under full ownership , exclusive dominion , and sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the Holy See ( Latin : Sancta Sedes ) . [ g ] With an area of 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of about 1,000 , it is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area and population . The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere . The Holy See dates back to early Christianity , and is the primate episcopal see of the Catholic Church , with 1.3 billion Catholic Christians around the world distributed in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches . The independent Vatican City-state , on the other hand , came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756-1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy . Within the Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter 's Basilica , the Sistine Chapel , and the Vatican Museums . They feature some of the world 's most famous paintings and sculptures . The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs , fees for admission to museums , and sales of publications .",
  "/wiki/Italian_diaspora": "The Italian diaspora is the large-scale emigration of Italians from Italy . There are two major Italian diasporas in Italian history . The first diaspora began more or less around 1880 , a decade or so after the Unification of Italy ( with most leaving after 1880 ) , and ended in the 1920s to early-1940s with the rise of Fascism in Italy . The second diaspora started after the end of World War II and roughly concluded in the 1970s . These together constituted the largest voluntary emigration period in documented history . Between 1880-1980 , about 15,000,000 Italians left the country permanently . By 1980 , it was estimated that about 25,000,000 Italians were residing outside Italy . A third wave is being reported in present times , due to the socio-economic problems caused by the financial crisis of the early twenty-first century , especially amongst the youth . According to the Public Register of Italian Residents Abroad ( AIRE ) , figures of Italians abroad rose from 3,106,251 in 2006 to 4,636,647 in 2015 , growing by 49.3% in just ten years .",
  "/wiki/Italian_Empire": "The Italian colonial empire ( Italian : Impero coloniale italiano ) , known as the Italian Empire ( Impero italiano ) between 1936 and 1943 , comprised the colonies , protectorates , concessions , dependencies and trust territories of the Kingdom of Italy ( after 1946 the Italian Republic ) . The genesis of the Italian colonial empire was the purchase in 1869 of Assab Bay on the Red Sea by an Italian navigation company which intended to establish a coaling station at the time the Suez Canal was being opened to navigation . This was taken over by the Italian government in 1882 , becoming modern Italy 's first overseas territory . Over the next two decades , the pace of European acquisitions in Africa increased , causing the so-called Scramble for Africa . By the start of the First World War in 1914 , Italy had acquired in Africa the colony of Eritrea on the Red Sea coast , a large protectorate and later colony in Somalia , and authority in formerly Ottoman Tripolitania and Cyrenaica ( gained after the Italo-Turkish War ) which were later unified in the colony of Libya . Outside Africa , Italy possessed the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey ( following the Italo-Turkish War ) and a concession in Tianjin in China ( following the Boxer War ) . During the First World War , Italy occupied southern Albania to prevent it from falling to Austria-Hungary . In 1917 , it established a protectorate over Albania , which remained in place until 1920 . The Fascist government that came to power with Benito Mussolini in 1922 sought to increase the size of the Italian empire and to satisfy the claims of Italian irredentists . In its second invasion of Ethiopia in 1935-36 , Italy was successful and it merged its new conquest with its older east African colonies to create Italian East Africa . In 1939 , Italy invaded Albania and incorporated it into the Fascist state . During the Second World War ( 1939-1945 ) , Italy occupied British Somaliland , parts of south-eastern France , western Egypt and most of Greece , but then lost those conquests and its African colonies , including Ethiopia , to the invading allied forces by 1943 .",
