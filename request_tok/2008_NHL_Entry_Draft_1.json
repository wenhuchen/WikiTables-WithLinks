  "/wiki/NHL_compensatory_draft_selection": "The NHL Entry Draft ( French : Rep\u00eachage d'entr\u00e9e dans la LNH ) is an annual meeting in which every franchise of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) systematically select the rights to available ice hockey players who meet draft eligibility requirements ( North American players 18-20 years old and European/international players 18-21 years old ; all others enter league as unrestricted free agents ) . The NHL Entry Draft is held once every year , generally within two to three months after the conclusion of the previous season . During the draft , teams take turns selecting amateur players from junior or collegiate leagues and professional players from European leagues . The first draft was held in 1963 , and has been held every year since . The NHL Entry Draft was known as the NHL Amateur Draft until 1979 . The entry draft has only been a public event since 1980 , and a televised event since 1984 . Up to 1994 , the order was solely determined by the standings at the end of the regular season . In 1995 , the NHL Draft Lottery was introduced where only teams who had missed the playoffs could participate . The lottery winner moved up the draft order a maximum of four places , meaning only the five worst teams , based on regular season points in a given season , could pick first in the draft , and no team in the non-playoff group could move down more than one place . The chances of winning the lottery were weighted towards the teams at the bottom of the regular season standings . Beginning in 2013 , the limit of moving up a maximum of four places in the draft order was eliminated , so the lottery winner would automatically receive the first overall pick , and any teams above it in the draft order would still move down one spot .",
