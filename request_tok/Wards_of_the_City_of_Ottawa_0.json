Until the 1972 elections , the ward was represented by two councillors ( then called aldermen ) . Prior to the 1980 election , the Ward was split in half , with the western half remaining as Alta Vista ward and the eastern half became Canterbury Ward . They were reunited prior to the 1994 Election and was known as Alta Vista-Canterbury Ward . During this time , on regional council it was known as just Alta Vista Ward . It was renamed to Alta Vista in 2000 . The ward is located in Ottawa 's southeast end , and covers the neighbourhoods of Eastway Gardens , Riverview , Alta Vista , Heron Gate and Sheffield Glen . The Ward is often advertised by candidates as Alta Vista-Canterbury-Riverview . The ward covers an area of 20.3 km2 . There is only a small boundary change for the 2006 election : the boundary will follow Highway 417 instead of the old city limits from Walkley north to the CPR right-of-way . Until 2014 , the ward was represented by Peter Hume .",
  "/wiki/Alta_Vista_Drive": "Alta Vista Drive is a suburban road in Ottawa , Ontario , Canada . It runs from Bank Street in the south to Industrial Avenue in the north covering the neighbourhoods of Ridgemont , Alta Vista and Riverview . Alta Vista was created as the result of major residential developments ( notably the Rideau Park and Alta Vista subdivisions ) in the region following World War II . First referred to as the 100 foot highway , was renamed Churchill Avenue ( after Winston Churchill ) in 1941 . It became Alta Vista Drive in July 1950 as the result of Ottawa annexing that part of Gloucester Township ( there was already a Churchill Avenue in Ottawa ) . The first stretch was built between Smyth Road and Kilborn Avenue in 1939 . Gloucester Township Council passed a by-law on May 3 , 1937 permitting its construction . The stretch from Kilborn to Randall was built in 1940 ; the stretch north of Smyth in 1942 ( to what is now Terminal Avenue ) and south of Randall to Bank Street ( then called Metcalfe Road ) in 1947 . Alta Vista originally ran past Industrial and connected with the Vanier Parkway , but the intersection , which also involved Riverside Drive was re-aligned in 1986 . Furthermore , in the 1990s , Alta Vista gained bicycle lanes along its entire stretch . Alta Vista is so named for its general height , as the neighbourhoods it runs through are generally higher than the rest of the city ( the name means a view from above or high view in Spanish and Portuguese ) . The name was first applied to the area in 1913 , for a small subdivision built on the north side of Randall Avenue which had a good view of Parliament Hill .",
