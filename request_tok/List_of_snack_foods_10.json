[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Whey": "Whey is the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled and strained . It is a byproduct of the manufacture of cheese or casein and has several commercial uses . Sweet whey is a byproduct produced during the manufacture of rennet types of hard cheese , like cheddar or Swiss cheese . Acid whey ( also known as sour whey ) is a byproduct produced during the making of acid types of dairy products , such as cottage cheese or strained yogurt . Whey proteins consist of \u03b1-lactalbumin , \u03b2-lactoglobulin , serum albumin , immunoglobulins , and proteose-peptones .",
  "/wiki/Milkfat": "Butterfat or milkfat is the fatty portion of milk . Milk and cream are often sold according to the amount of butterfat they contain .",
  "/wiki/Milk_protein": "Milk is a nutrient-rich , white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals . It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals ( including humans who are breastfed ) before they are able to digest other types of food . Early-lactation milk contains colostrum , which carries the mother 's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases . It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose . Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon , particularly among humans , many of whom consume the milk of other mammals . As an agricultural product , milk , also called dairy milk , is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy . Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 , from 260 million dairy cows . India is the world 's largest producer of milk , and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder , yet it exports few other milk products . The ever-increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future . New Zealand , Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products . China and Russia were the world 's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient , contributing to a worldwide glut of milk . Throughout the world , more than six billion people consume milk and milk products .",
  "/wiki/Cheese": "Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors , textures , and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein . It comprises proteins and fat from milk , usually the milk of cows , buffalo , goats , or sheep . During production , the milk is usually acidified , and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation . The solids are separated and pressed into final form . Some cheeses have molds on the rind , the outer layer , or throughout . Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature . Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries . Their styles , textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk ( including the animal 's diet ) , whether they have been pasteurized , the butterfat content , the bacteria and mold , the processing , and how long they have been aged for . Herbs , spices , or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents . The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto . Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses , such as black pepper , garlic , chives or cranberries . A cheesemonger , or specialist seller of cheeses , may have expertise with selecting the cheeses , purchasing , receiving , storing and ripening them .",

  "/wiki/Oaxaca_cheese": "Oaxaca cheese ( Spanish : queso Oaxaca ) more commonly referred to as Quesillo is a white , semihard cheese from Mexico , similar to unaged Monterey jack , but with a mozzarella-like string cheese texture . Outside Mexico , Oaxaca cheese is often confused with asadero ( queso asadero ) , a cheese produced in the northern state of Chihuahua . They are similar in texture and taste , but they are produced with different methods , making Oaxaca cheese slightly drier . It is named after the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico , where it was first made . The string cheese process ( pasta filata ) , originally from Italy , which is used to produce mozzarella , was brought to Mexico by the Dominican friars that settled in Oaxaca . As water buffalo milk was unavailable , they used cow 's milk , instead . The cheese is available in several different shapes . The production process is complicated and involves stretching the cheese into long ribbons and rolling it up like a ball of yarn . Italian mozzarella is another cheese which is processed by stretching ( the pasta filata process ) . Queso Oaxaca is used widely in Mexican cuisine , especially in quesadillas and empanadas , where the queso Oaxaca is melted and other ingredients , such as huitlacoche and squash flowers , are added to the filling .",
  "/wiki/Obatzda": "Obatzda [ \u02c8o\u02d0batsd\u0250 ] ( also spelt Obazda and Obatzter ) [ citation needed ] is a Bavarian cheese delicacy .

Its invention is credited to Walter Gerber of Thun , Switzerland , in 1911 .",
  "/wiki/String_cheese": "String cheese refers to several different types of cheese where the manufacturing process aligns the proteins in the cheese , which makes it stringy . When mozzarella is heated to 60 \u00b0C ( 140 \u00b0F ) and then stretched , the milk proteins line up . It is possible to peel strings or strips from the larger cheese ."
