  "/wiki/Maryland": "Maryland ( US : /\u02c8m\u025br\u0259l\u0259nd/ ( listen ) MERR-\u0259-l\u0259nd ) [ a ] is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States , bordering Virginia , West Virginia , and the District of Columbia to its south and west ; Pennsylvania to its north ; and Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to its east . The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

Wisconsin is the 23rd largest state by total area and the 20th most populous . The state capital is Madison , and its largest city is Milwaukee , which is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan . The state is divided into 72 counties . Wisconsin 's geography is diverse , having been greatly impacted by glaciers during the Ice Age with the exception of the Driftless Area . The Northern Highland and Western Upland along with a part of the Central Plain occupies the western part of the state , with lowlands stretching to the shore of Lake Michigan . Wisconsin is second to Michigan in the length of its Great Lakes coastline . During the 19th and early 20th centuries , many European settlers entered the state , many of whom emigrated from Germany and Scandinavia . Like neighboring Minnesota , the state remains a center of German American and Scandinavian American culture . The state is one of the nation 's leading dairy producers and is known as America 's Dairyland ; it is particularly famous for its cheese . Manufacturing ( especially paper products ) , information technology ( IT ) , cranberries , ginseng , and tourism are also major contributors to the state 's economy .",

Ohio is bordered by Lake Erie to the north , Pennsylvania to the east , West Virginia to the southeast , Kentucky to the southwest , Indiana to the west , and Michigan to the northwest . The state takes its name from the Ohio River , whose name in turn originated from the Seneca word ohi\u02d0yo ' , meaning good river , great river or large creek . Partitioned from the Northwest Territory , Ohio was the 17th state admitted to the Union on March 1 , 1803 , and the first under the Northwest Ordinance . Ohio is historically known as the Buckeye State after its Ohio buckeye trees , and Ohioans are also known as Buckeyes . Ohio rose from the wilderness of Ohio Country west of Appalachia in colonial times through the Northwest Indian Wars as part of the Northwest Territory in the early frontier , to become the first non-colonial free state admitted to the union , to an industrial powerhouse in the 20th century before transitioning to a more information and service based economy in the 21st . The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch , led by the governor ; the legislative branch , which comprises the bicameral Ohio General Assembly ; and the judicial branch , led by the state Supreme Court . Ohio occupies 16 seats in the United States House of Representatives . Ohio is known for its status as both a swing state and a bellwether in national elections .

The area code was the first to split from Arkansas 's original area code , 501 . The supply of unassigned phone numbers for 870 was projected to run out sometime in 2013 , according to the Arkansas Public Service Commission , prompting a December 2009 approval of a plan for an eventual overlay area code in this portion of the state . Area code 327 was assigned for this purpose in January 2010 , but the release of little-used exchanges soon began freeing numbers , and the overlay was indefinitely suspended in June 2012 .

It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut , Prince Edward Island , and Nova Scotia . Quebec is Canada 's largest province by area and its second-largest administrative division ; only the territory of Nunavut is larger . It is historically and politically considered to be part of Central Canada ( with Ontario ) . Quebec is the second-most populous province of Canada , after Ontario . It is the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population , with French as the sole provincial official language . Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City , the capital . Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area , including the Island of Montreal . English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais , Eastern Townships , and Gasp\u00e9 regions . The Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec region , occupying the northern half of the province , is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples . The climate around the major cities is four-seasons continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers , but farther north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions .",

However , by the mid-1990s it was on the verge of exhaustion due to Montreal 's rapid growth and Canada 's inefficient system of number allocation . All Canadian competitive local exchange carriers are allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers for every rate centre where they plan to offer service , even in the smallest hamlets . Even though most rate centres do n't need nearly that many numbers , a number ca n't be reallocated elsewhere once assigned to a carrier and rate centre . This resulted in thousands of wasted numbers . By the latter years of the 20th century , this made a second area code necessary in Canada 's second-largest toll-free calling zone . 450 entered service in 1998 . It completely surrounds 514 , which was confined to the Island of Montreal and a few surrounding islands , making it one of the six pairs of doughnut area codes in the numbering plan , and the only one in Canada . For this reason , Montrealers sometimes refer to the off-island suburbs as les 450 ( the 450s ) , much like the suburbs of Toronto are called the 905 .",

Atypically for Canada , only about half of the population lives in urban areas , mostly in Greater Moncton , Greater Saint John and the capital Fredericton . Unlike the other Maritime provinces , New Brunswick 's terrain is mostly forested uplands , with much of the land further from the coast , giving it a harsher climate . New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely-populated than the rest of the Maritimes . Being relatively close to Europe , New Brunswick was among the first places in North America to be explored and settled by Europeans , starting with the French in the early 1600s , who displaced the indigenous Mi'kmaq , Maliseet , and the Passamaquoddy peoples . The French settlers were later displaced when the area became part of the British Empire . In 1784 , after an influx of refugees from the American Revolutionary War , the province was partitioned from Nova Scotia . In 1785 Saint John became Canada 's first incorporated city .

  "/wiki/Area_codes_909_and_840": "Area codes 840 and 909 are California telephone area codes that cover far eastern Los Angeles County and southwestern San Bernardino County . The 909 area code was split from area code 714 on November 14 , 1992 . By August 1993 use of the new area code became mandatory . Western Riverside County was split off from 909 into area code 951 on July 17 , 2004 . 909 still covers small portions of Corona , Riverside , and Moreno Valley , which are in Riverside County . Originally on the same date that 951 split off from 909 , the area retaining the 909 area code was to be overlaid by a new area code 752 . However , as a result of number pooling , this overlay plan was shelved prior to the 909/951 split and 752 was returned to the NANPA numbering pool to be assigned at a later date . On July 23 , 2019 , the California Public Utilities Commission announced that the 909 area code will be overlaid with area code 840 on February 23 , 2021 . Come late July 2020 , permissive calling will start . This would ease customers from the burden & expense of changing numbers . 840 is California 's 36th area code . When it goes into effect , exactly half of California 's 24 geographically designated area code zones will be overlay areas while the other 12 will retain single-area code status .",
