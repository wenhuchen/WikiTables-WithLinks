The Spanish city of Manila was founded on June 24 , 1571 , by Spanish conquistador Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi . The date is regarded as the city 's official founding date ; however , a settlement has already existed dating back as far as 1258 . Manila was also the seat of power for most of the country 's colonial rulers . It is home to many historic sites , some of which were built during the 16th century . Manila has many of the Philippines ' firsts , including the first university ( 1590 ) , light station ( 1642 ) , lighthouse tower ( 1846 ) , water system ( 1878 ) , hotel ( 1889 ) , electricity ( 1895 ) , oceanarium ( 1913 ) , stock exchange ( 1927 ) , flyover ( 1930s ) , zoo ( 1959 ) , pedestrian underpass ( 1960 ) , science high school ( 1963 ) , city-run university ( 1965 ) , city-run hospital ( 1969 ) , and rapid transit system ( 1984 ; also considered as the first rapid transit system in Southeast Asia ) .

It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense .

The battle , which resulted in the defeat of U.S. forces , was the most significant action of the Great Sioux War of 1876 . It took place on June 25-26 , 1876 , along the Little Bighorn River in the Crow Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana Territory . The fight was an overwhelming victory for the Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho , who were led by several major war leaders , including Crazy Horse and Chief Gall , and had been inspired by the visions of Sitting Bull ( T\u021fat\u021f\u00e1\u014bka \u00cdyotake ) . The U.S. 7th Cavalry , a force of 700 men , suffered a major defeat while under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer ( formerly a brevetted major general during the American Civil War ) .

Whether the occupants of Bud Dajo were hostile to U.S. forces is disputed , as inhabitants of Jolo Island had previously used the crater as a place of refuge during Spanish assaults . Major Hugh Scott , the District Governor of Sulu Province , where the incident occurred , recounted that those who fled to the crater declared they had no intention of fighting , - ran up there only in fright , [ and ] had some crops planted and desired to cultivate them . The description of the engagement as a battle is disputed because of both the overwhelming firepower of the attackers and the lopsided casualties . The author Vic Hurley wrote , By no stretch of the imagination could Bud Dajo be termed a 'battle ' . Mark Twain commented , In what way was it a battle ? It has no resemblance to a battle . We cleaned up our four days ' work and made it complete by butchering these helpless people . A higher percentage of Moros were killed than in other incidents now considered massacres . For example , the highest estimate of Native Americans killed at the Wounded Knee Massacre is 300 out of 350 ( a death rate of 85 percent ) , whereas in Bud Dajo there were only six Moro survivors out of a group estimated at 1,000 ( a death rate of over 99 percent ) .

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war .

Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War .

Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes .

  "/wiki/Fireman's_axe": "An axe ( sometimes ax in American English ; see spelling differences ) is an implement that has been used for millennia to shape , split and cut wood , to harvest timber , as a weapon , and as a ceremonial or heraldic symbol . The axe has many forms and specialised uses but generally consists of an axe head with a handle , or helve . Before the modern axe , the stone-age hand axe was used from 1.5 million years BP without a handle . It was later fastened to a wooden handle . The earliest examples of handled axes have heads of stone with some form of wooden handle attached ( hafted ) in a method to suit the available materials and use . Axes made of copper , bronze , iron and steel appeared as these technologies developed . Axes are usually composed of a head and a handle . The axe is an example of a simple machine , as it is a type of wedge , or dual inclined plane . This reduces the effort needed by the wood chopper . It splits the wood into two parts by the pressure concentration at the blade . The handle of the axe also acts as a lever allowing the user to increase the force at the cutting edge - not using the full length of the handle is known as choking the axe . For fine chopping using a side axe this sometimes is a positive effect , but for felling with a double bitted axe it reduces efficiency .",
