It was founded by the Arab scholar Al-Shafii , a pupil of Malik , in the early 9th century . The other three schools of Sunni jurisprudence are Hanafi , Maliki and Hanbali . The Shafi school predominantly relies on the Quran and the Hadiths for Sharia . Where passages of Quran and Hadiths are ambiguous , the school first seeks religious law guidance from Ijma - the consensus of Scholars ( Community of Islamic scholars ) . If there was no consensus , the Shafii school relies on individual opinion ( Ijtihad ) of the companions of Muhammad , followed by analogy . The Shafii school was , in the early history of Islam , the most followed ideology for Sharia . [ citation needed ] However , with the Ottoman Empire 's expansion and patronage , it was replaced with the Hanafi school in many parts of the Muslim world . One of the many differences between the Shafii and Hanafi schools is that the Shafii school does not consider Istihsan ( judicial discretion by suitably qualified legal scholars ) as an acceptable source of religious law because it amounts to human legislation of Islamic law . [ not specific enough to verify ] The Shafii school is now predominantly found in Somalia , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Djibouti , eastern Egypt , the Swahili coast , Hijaz , Yemen , Kurdish regions of the Middle East , Dagestan , Chechen and Ingush regions of the Caucasus , Indonesia , Malaysia , Sri Lanka , Maldives , Kerala and some other coastal regions in India , Singapore , Myanmar , Thailand , Brunei , and the Philippines .",
