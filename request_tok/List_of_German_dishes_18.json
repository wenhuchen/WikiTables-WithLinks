  "/wiki/Kassler": "Kassler or Kasseler in German cuisine is the name given to a salted ( cured ) and slightly smoked cut of pork similar to British gammon . It can be either hot or cold smoked . Pork necks and loins are the most often used cuts although ribs , shoulders and bellies can also be used . It is often served with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes . In addition to pork , chicken prepared 'Kasseler ' style is available at some butchers . It is unclear where the name comes from . It is often said , that the name derived from a Berlin-based butcher called Cassel who prepared the cut in the late 19th century . However , records of the town 's inhabitants show that in the 19th century no butcher named Cassel or Kassel was living in Berlin . Likewise , it is not possible to prove that Kasseler comes from the German town Kassel . In Finland , pork neck of any type is called kassler . A similar dish , hamburgerryg , is eaten in Denmark . In this variation the meat is boiled .",

  "/wiki/Pickert": "A pickert is a flat , fried or baked potato dish from Westphalia , Germany . It can be considered a kind of flattened dumpling or very nourishing pancake . It comes as a round Pfannenpickert the size of a pan , a rectangular Kastenpickert , or a palm-sized regular Pickert . The name is derived from Low German picken , pecken ( to stick something onto something else ) . The main ingredients are grated potatoes , flour , milk , eggs , and ( usually ) raisins , with a little yeast , salt and sugar , and oil for the baking . Three big potatoes produce 10-15 palm-sized pickerts , enough for 4-5 people . Pickerts are a specialty of the district of Lippe , where they developed from a traditional meal for the poorer people . In former times , Pickert was eaten as breakfast or lunch by poor farmers , being a cheap and very nourishing dish , as would be required of food for a day 's work in the fields . They are now served spread with sugar beet syrup , butter or ( plum ) jam , or leberwurst . A related dish , Lappenpickert , is found in the regions west of Lippe , towards M\u00fcnster and the Ruhr Area . It does not usually contain raisins and yeast , but may have a dash of sweet cream added . Lappenpickert is usually baked in rather thin pancakes on a griddle greased with a side of lard , and eaten with the same spreads as Pickerts from Lippe , or with smoked fish or cold cuts .",

  "/wiki/Westfalen": "Westphalia ( /w\u025bst\u02c8fe\u026ali\u0259/ ; German : Westfalen [ v\u025bst\u02c8fa\u02d0l\u0259n ] ; Low German : Westfalen [ v\u03b5s ( t ) 'f\u0254\u02d0ln ] ) is a region of northwestern Germany and one of the three historic parts of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia . It has an area of 20,210 km2 ( 7,803 sq mi ) and 7.9 million inhabitants . The region is almost identical with the Province of Westphalia , which was a part of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1815 to 1918 and the Free State of Prussia from 1918 to 1946 . In 1946 , Westphalia merged with the Northern Rhineland , another former part of Prussia , to form the newly created state of North Rhine-Westphalia . In 1947 , the state with its two historic parts was joined by a third one : Lippe , a former principality and free state . All of the seventeen districts and nine independent cities of Westphalia and Lippe 's only district are members of the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association ( Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe ) . Previous to the formation of Westphalia as a province of Prussia and later state part of North Rhine-Westphalia , the term Westphalia was applied to different territories of different sizes such as a part of the ancient Duchy of Saxony , the Duchy of Westphalia or the Kingdom of Westphalia . The Westphalian language , a variant of the German language , spreads beyond Westphalia 's borders into southwestern Lower Saxony and northwestern Hesse .",

  "/wiki/Stippgr\u00fctze": "Stippgr\u00fctze , also called Wurstebrei , is a German dish from Westphalia which is similar to Gr\u00fctzwurst or Knipp . It consists of barley groats cooked in sausage juices ( Wurstbr\u00fche ) , which are enriched with pieces of meat , offal , such as heart , kidney or liver and seasoned with spices and salt . More rarely , finely chopped onions are added . The cooked ingredients are minced after the juices have been poured off and a crumbly cake is left which is held together with fat and which sets on cooling . There are various recipes , but they all contain barley groats , fat and meat . A classic recipe contains pig offal or heart , belly pork with rind , lard greaves , barley groats , water , salt , pepper , allspice and thyme . The nutrition varies ; one portion made from about 300 g of pork and 60 g of groats contains about 850 kJ . Its relatively high fat content means that Stippgr\u00fctze keeps well and is often preserved or frozen , so that it can be used over the winter . The season for Stippgr\u00fctze begins with the traditional Schlachtfest or country feast in October or November , when the pigs are slaughtered , and lasts until spring . In the shops Stippgr\u00fctze is usually sold in sausage form in clear artificial casings about 12 cm in diameter . To prepare it a large piece is fried in a pan without any additional fat , until a firm crust forms on the underside , occasionally it is stirred and fried again . A sort of porridge or puree ( Brei ) results , hence its other name of Wurstebrei ( sausage puree ) ."
