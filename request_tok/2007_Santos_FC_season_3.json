  "/wiki/Association_football_positions": "In the sport of association football , each of the 11 players on a team is assigned to a particular position on the field of play . A team is made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players who fill various defensive , midfield , and attacking positions depending on the formation deployed . These positions describe both the player 's main role and their area of operation on the pitch . In the early development of the game , formations were much more offensively aggressive , with the 1-2-7 being prominent in the late 1800s . In the latter part of the 19th century , the 2-3-5 formation became widely used and the position names became more refined to reflect this . In defence , there were full-backs , known as the left-back and right-back ; in midfield , left-half , centre-half and right-half ; and for the forward line there were outside-left ( or left wing ) , inside-left , centre-forward , inside-right and outside-right ( or right wing ) . As the game has evolved , tactics and team formations have changed and so many of the names of the positions have changed to reflect their duties in the modern game ( though some old familiar ones remain ) . The term half-back fell out of use by the early 1970s and midfield was used in naming the positions that play around the middle third as in centre midfield and wide midfield . The fluid nature of the modern game means that positions in football are not as rigidly defined as in sports such as rugby or American football . Even so , most players will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career , as each position requires a particular set of skills and physical attributes . Footballers who are able to play comfortably in a number of positions are referred to as utility players . However , in Total Football tactics , the players are only loosely defined into a position .",
  "/wiki/Defender_(association_football)": "In the sport of association football , a defender is an outfield player whose primary roles is to stop attacks during the game and prevent the opposing team from scoring goals . Centre backs are usually are in pairs , with 2 full-backs to their left and right , but can come in threes with no full backs There are four types of defenders : centre-back , sweeper , full-back , and wing-back . The centre-back and full-back positions are essential in most modern formations . The sweeper and wing-back roles are more specialized for certain formations .",

  "/wiki/Forward_(association_football)": "Forwards are the players on a football ( soccer ) team who play nearest to the opposing team 's goal , and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals . Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players . Modern team formations generally include one to three forwards ; for example , the common 4-2-3-1 formation includes one forward . Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards , or none .",
