  "section_text": "The oldest known [ nb 16 ] Japanese [ nb 17 ] large-scale works are historical books ( Kojiki and Nihon Shoki ) or regional cultural and geographical records ( fudoki ) compiled on imperial order in the early 8th century . [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] They were written with the aim of legitimizing the new centralized state under imperial rule by linking the origin of emperors to the Age of the Gods . [ 138 ] [ 141 ] [ 142 ] The oldest of these historical books is the Kojiki ( `` Record of ancient matters '' ) dating from 712 and composed by \u014c no Yasumaro at the request of Empress Genmei . [ 9 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] Written in ancient Japanese style using Chinese ideographs , it presents the mythological origin of Japan and historical events up to the year 628 . [ 143 ] [ 144 ] Shortly after the completion of the Kojiki , the Nihon Shoki ( or Nihongi ) appeared in 720 , probably originating to an order by Emperor Tenmu in 681 . [ 140 ] [ 145 ] It is a much more detailed version of the Kojiki , dating events and providing alternative versions of myths ; it covers the time up to 697 . [ 144 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] Compared to the Kojiki , it follows the model of Chinese dynastic histories more closely in style and language , using orthodox classical Chinese . [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Both of these works provide the historical and spiritual basis for shinto . [ 144 ] [ 150 ] In 713 , Empress Genmei ordered provincial governors to compile official reports on the history , geography and local folk customs . [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ] These provincial gazetteers are known as fudoki ( lit . `` Records of wind and earth '' ) and provide valuable information about economic and ethnographic data , local culture and tales . [ 153 ] [ 154 ] Of more than 60 provincial records compiled in the early 8th century only five survived : one , the Izumo Fudoki ( 733 ) , in complete form and four , Bungo ( 730s ) , Harima ( circa 715 ) , Hitachi ( 714\u2013718 ) and Hizen ( 730s ) as fragments . [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 154 ] The Nihon Shoki is the first official history of Japan and the first of a set of six national histories ( Rikkokushi ) compiled over a 200-year period on Chinese models . [ 145 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] Based on these six histories , Sugawara no Michizane arranged historical events chronologically and thematically in the Ruij\u016b Kokushi which was completed in 892 . [ 157 ] [ 158 ] With the cessation of official missions to China and a general trend of turning away from Chinese-derived institutions and behavioral patterns in the latter part of the 9th century , the compilation of such national histories patterned on formal Chinese dynastic histories was abandoned . [ 159 ] With the development of kana script , new styles of uniquely Japanese literature such as the monogatari appeared around that time . [ 159 ] The newer style of historic writing that emerged during the Fujiwara regency , at the turning point of ancient imperial rule and the classical era , was called historic tale ( rekishi monogatari ) and became influenced by the fictional tale , especially by the Tale of Genji , with which it shared the scene-by-scene construction as fundamental difference to earlier historic writings . [ nb 18 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ] [ 161 ] The oldest historical tale is the Eiga Monogatari ( `` A Tale of Flowering Fortunes '' ) , giving a eulogistic chronological account of the Fujiwara from 946 to 1027 , focusing particularly on Fujiwara no Michinaga . [ 162 ] [ 163 ] [ 164 ] It was largely [ nb 19 ] written by Akazome Emon , probably shortly after the death of Michinaga in 1027 . [ 161 ] [ 165 ]",

  "intro": "The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897,\nalthough the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The written materials in the list adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value. Writing was introduced from Korea to Japan around 400 AD (in the form of Chinese books), with work done in Chinese by immigrant scribes from the mainland. [nb 1] Literacy remained at an extremely marginal level in the 5th and 6th centuries, but during the 7th century a small number of Japanese scholar-aristocrats such as Prince Sh\u014dtoku began to write in Chinese for official purposes and in order to promote Buddhism. By the late 7th century, reading and writing had become an integral part of life of some sections of the ruling and intellectual classes, particularly in government and religion. The earliest extant large-scale works compiled in Japan are the historical chronicles Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720). Other early Japanese works from the Nara period include biographies of Prince Sh\u014dtoku, cultural and geographical records (fudoki) and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, the first anthology of Japanese poetry. Necessarily all of these works were either written in Chinese or in a hybrid Japanese-Chinese style and were modeled on Chinese prototypes. The development of a distinct Japanese script (kana) in the 9th century was the starting point of the classical age of Japanese literature and led to a number of new, uniquely Japanese genres of literature, such as tales (monogatari) or diaries (nikki). Because of the strong interest and support in literature of the Heian court, writing activities flourished particularly in the 10th and 11th centuries. This list contains books of various type that have been compiled in Classical and early Feudal Japan."
