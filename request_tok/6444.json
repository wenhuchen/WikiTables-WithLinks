  "/wiki/Tule_Lake_War_Relocation_Center": "The Tule Lake National Monument in Modoc and Siskiyou counties in California , consists primarily of the site of the Tule Lake War Relocation Center , one of ten concentration camps constructed in 1942 by the United States government to incarcerate Japanese Americans forcibly removed from their homes on the West Coast . They totaled nearly 120,000 people , more than two-thirds of whom were United States citizens . After a period of use , this facility was renamed the Tule Lake Segregation Center in 1943 , and used as a maximum security , segregation camp to separate and hold those prisoners considered disloyal or disruptive to the operations of other camps . Inmates from other camps were sent here to segregate them from the general population . Draft resisters and others who protested the injustices of the camps , including by their answers on the loyalty questionnaire , were sent here . At its peak , Tule Lake Segregation Center ( with 18,700 inmates ) was the largest of the ten camps and the most controversial . 29,840 people were held there over the four years it was open . After the war it became a holding area for Japanese Americans slated for deportation or expatriation to Japan , including some who had renounced US citizenship under duress . Many joined a class action suit because of civil rights abuses ; many gained the chance to stay in the United States through court hearings but did not regain their citizenship due to opposition by the Department of Justice . The camp was not closed until March 20 , 1946 , months after the end of the war . Twenty years later , members of the class action suit gained restoration of US citizenship through court rulings . California later designated this Tule Lake camp site as a California Historical Landmark and in 2006 , it was ranked as a National Historic Landmark ."
