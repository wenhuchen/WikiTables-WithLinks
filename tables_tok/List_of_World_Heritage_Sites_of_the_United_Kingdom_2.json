  "section_text": "The Tentative List is an inventory of important heritage and natural sites that a country is considering for inscription on the World Heritage List , thereby becoming World Heritage Sites . The Tentative List can be updated at any time , but inclusion on the list is a prerequisite to being considered for inscription within a five- to ten-year period . [ 60 ] The UK 's Tentative List was last updated on 25 July 2014 , and consisted of 11 sites . The properties on the Tentative List are as follows : [ 61 ]",

  "intro": "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. There are 32 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories. The UNESCO list contains one designated site in both England and Scotland (the Frontiers of the Roman Empire) plus eighteen exclusively in England, five in Scotland, three in Wales, one in Northern Ireland, and one in each of the overseas territories of Bermuda, Gibraltar, the Pitcairn Islands, and Saint Helena. The first sites in the UK to be inscribed on the World Heritage List were Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast; Durham Castle and Cathedral; Ironbridge Gorge; Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey; Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites; and the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd in 1986. The latest site to be inscribed was the Jodrell Bank Observatory in England in July 2019. The constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (commonly referred to as UNESCO) was ratified in 1946 by 26 countries, including the UK. Its purpose was to provide for the conservation and protection of the worlds inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science. The UK contributes \u00a3130,000 annually to the World Heritage Fund which finances the preservation of sites in developing countries. Some designated properties contain multiple sites that share a common geographical location or cultural heritage. The United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO advises the British government, which is responsible for maintaining its World Heritage Sites, on policies regarding UNESCO. The UK National Commission for UNESCO conducted research in 2014-15 on the Wider Value of UNESCO to the UK, and found that the UK's World Heritage Sites generated an estimated \u00a385 million from April 2014 to March 2015 through their association with the global network. World Heritage Site selection criteria i-vi are culturally related, and selection criteria vii-x are the natural criteria."
