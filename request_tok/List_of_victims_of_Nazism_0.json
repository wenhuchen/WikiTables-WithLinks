Poisonous agents used include hydrogen cyanide , carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide . Gas chambers were used as a method of execution for condemned prisoners in the United States beginning in the 1920s and continue to be a legal execution method in three states . During the Holocaust , large-scale gas chambers designed for mass killing were used by Nazi Germany as part of their genocide program . The use of gas chambers in North Korea has also been reported .",
  "/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp": "The Auschwitz concentration camp ( Konzentrationslager Auschwitz ) was a complex of over 40 concentration and extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II and the Holocaust . It consisted of Auschwitz I , the main camp ( Stammlager ) in O\u015bwi\u0119cim ; Auschwitz II-Birkenau , a concentration and extermination camp built with several gas chambers ; Auschwitz III-Monowitz , a labor camp created to staff a factory for the chemical conglomerate IG Farben ; and dozens of subcamps . The camps became a major site of the Nazis ' Final Solution to the Jewish Question . After Germany sparked World War II by invading Poland in September 1939 , the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) converted Auschwitz I , an army barracks , into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners . The first inmates , German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as functionaries , established the camp 's reputation for sadism , beating , torturing , and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons . The first gassings - of Soviet and Polish prisoners - took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941 . Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month , and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers . Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz , 1.1 million died . The death toll includes 960,000 Jews ( 865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival ) , 74,000 non-Jewish Poles , 21,000 Roma , 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war , and up to 15,000 other Europeans . Those not gassed died of starvation , exhaustion , disease , individual executions , or beatings . Others were killed during medical experiments . At least 802 prisoners tried to escape , 144 successfully , and on 7 October 1944 two Sonderkommando units , consisting of prisoners who staffed the gas chambers , launched an unsuccessful uprising .",

It played a significant role in Adolf Hitler 's rise to power in the 1920s and 1930s . Its primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies , disrupting the meetings of opposing parties , fighting against the paramilitary units of the opposing parties , especially the Red Front Fighters League ( Rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund ) of the Communist Party of Germany ( KPD ) , and intimidating Romani , trade unionists , and , especially , Jews - for instance , during the 1933 Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses . The SA were also called the Brownshirts ( Braunhemden ) , from the color of their uniform shirts , similar to Benito Mussolini 's blackshirts . The SA developed pseudo-military titles for its members , with ranks that were later adopted by several other Nazi Party groups , chief amongst them the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) . This had originated as a branch of the SA before being separated . Brown-colored shirts were chosen as the SA uniform because a large number of them were cheaply available after World War I , having originally been ordered during the war for colonial troops posted to Germany 's former African colonies . After Adolf Hitler ordered the blood purge of 1934 , he withdrew support from the SA . This event became known as the Night of the Long Knives ( die Nacht der langen Messer ) . The SA continued to exist , but was effectively superseded by the SS , although the paramilitary forces were not formally dissolved until after Nazi Germany 's final capitulation to the Allies in 1945 .",

  "/wiki/Concentration_camp": "Internment is the imprisonment of people , commonly in large groups , without charges or intent to file charges , and thus no trial . The term is especially used for the confinement of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects . Thus , while it can simply mean imprisonment , it tends to refer to preventive confinement rather than confinement after having been convicted of some crime . Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities . Interned persons may be held in prisons or in facilities known as internment camps , also known as concentration camps . This involves internment generally , as distinct from the subset , the Nazi extermination camps , commonly referred to as death camps . Internment also refers to a neutral country 's practice of detaining belligerent armed forces and equipment on its territory during times of war under the Hague Convention of 1907 . The Universal Declaration of Human Rights restricts the use of internment . Article 9 states that No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest , detention or exile .",

The camp operated between 23 July 1942 and 19 October 1943 as part of Operation Reinhard , the deadliest phase of the Final Solution . During this time , it is estimated that between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews were killed in its gas chambers , along with 2,000 Romani people . More Jews were killed at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz . Managed by the German SS and the Trawniki guards - enlisted voluntarily from among Soviet POWs to serve with the Germans - the camp consisted of two separate units . [ c ] Treblinka I was a forced-labour camp ( Arbeitslager ) whose prisoners worked in the gravel pit or irrigation area and in the forest , where they cut wood to fuel the cremation pits . Between 1941 and 1944 , more than half of its 20,000 inmates died from summary executions , hunger , disease and mistreatment . The second camp , Treblinka II , was an extermination camp ( Vernichtungslager ) , referred to euphemistically as the SS-Sonderkommando Treblinka by the Nazis . A small number of Jewish men who were not killed immediately upon arrival became its Jewish slave-labour units called Sonderkommandos , forced to bury the victims ' bodies in mass graves . These bodies were exhumed in 1943 and cremated on large open-air pyres along with the bodies of new victims . Gassing operations at Treblinka II ended in October 1943 following a revolt by the Sonderkommandos in early August .",

  "/wiki/Suicide": "Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one 's own death . Mental disorders , including depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , personality disorders , anxiety disorders , and substance abuse - including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines - are risk factors . Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress , such as from financial difficulties , relationship problems such as breakups , or bullying . Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts . Effective suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide - such as firearms , drugs , and poisons ; treating mental disorders and substance misuse ; careful media reporting about suicide ; and improving economic conditions . Even though crisis hotlines are common , they have not been well studied . The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries , and is partly related to the availability of effective means . Common methods of suicide include hanging , pesticide poisoning , and firearms . Suicides resulted in 828,000 global deaths in 2015 , an increase from 712,000 deaths in 1990 . This makes suicide the 10th leading cause of death worldwide . Approximately 1.5% of people die by suicide . In a given year this is roughly 12 per 100,000 people .",

  "/wiki/Heart_failure": "Heart failure ( HF ) , also known as congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and congestive cardiac failure ( CCF ) , is when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body 's needs . Signs and symptoms of heart failure commonly include shortness of breath , excessive tiredness , and leg swelling . The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise or while lying down , and may wake the person at night . A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature . Chest pain , including angina , does not typically occur due to heart failure . Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease , including a previous myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) , high blood pressure , atrial fibrillation , valvular heart disease , excess alcohol use , infection , and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause . These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the function of the heart . The two types of left ventricular heart failure - heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) , and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) - are based on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract , or to relax , is affected . The severity of the heart failure is graded by the severity of symptoms with exercise . Heart failure is not the same as heart attack ( in which part of the heart muscle dies ) or cardiac arrest ( in which blood flow stops altogether ) . Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity , kidney failure , liver problems , anemia , and thyroid disease . Diagnosis is based on symptoms , physical findings , and echocardiography .",

In 1925 , Heinrich Himmler joined the unit , which had by then been reformed and given its final name .

During the interwar period , German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in Soviet Union . With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty , the Luftwaffe 's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935 , just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German re-armament and conscription would be announced on 16 March . The Condor Legion , a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War , provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft . Partially as a result of this combat experience , the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated , technologically advanced , and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in 1939 . By the summer of 1939 , the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader ( wings ) . The Luftwaffe also operated Fallschirmj\u00e4ger paratrooper units .

Situated in the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , and originally intended as a preliminary step upon a more extensive plan of creating the Judenfrei province of Warthegau , the ghetto was transformed into a major industrial centre , manufacturing war supplies for Nazi Germany and especially for the Wehrmacht . The number of people incarcerated in it was increased further by the Jews deported from the Third Reich territories . On 30 April 1940 , when the gates closed on the ghetto , it housed 163,777 residents . Because of its remarkable productivity , the ghetto managed to survive until August 1944 . In the first two years , it absorbed almost 20,000 Jews from liquidated ghettos in nearby Polish towns and villages , as well as 20,000 more from the rest of German-occupied Europe . After the wave of deportations to Che\u0142mno death camp beginning in early 1942 , and in spite of a stark reversal of fortune , the Germans persisted in eradicating the ghetto : they transported the remaining population to Auschwitz and Che\u0142mno extermination camps , where most were murdered upon arrival .

  "/wiki/Sobib\u00f3r_extermination_camp": "Sobibor ( /so\u028a\u02c8bi\u02d0b\u0254\u02d0r/ ) was a Nazi German extermination camp built and operated by the SS as part of Operation Reinhard . It was located in the forest next to the railway station of Sobib\u00f3r within the semi-colonial territory of the General Government in occupied Poland . Unlike many other Nazi concentration camps , Sobibor existed for the sole purpose of exterminating Jews . Most new arrivals were immediately sent to the gas chambers , with rare exceptions being made for those who were forced to serve as slave labourers who assisted in the operation of the camp . Some 200,000 to 250,000 people were murdered at Sobibor , making it the fourth deadliest extermination camp after Belzec , Treblinka , and Auschwitz . Sobibor is notable for the prisoner revolt which occurred on 14 October 1943 , an event which is often described as the most successful revolt ever to have taken place in a Nazi extermination camp . The plan for the revolt , which was developed by Alexander Pechersky and Leon Feldhendler , involved two phases . In the first phase , teams of prisoners were to assassinate all of the on-duty SS officers in discrete locations . In the second phase , all 600 prisoners would assemble for roll call and walk to freedom out the front gate . However , the revolt did not go as planned . The operation was discovered while several SS officers were still alive and prisoners ended up having to escape by climbing over barbed wire fences and running through a mine field under heavy machine gun fire . Even so , about 300 prisoners made it out of the camp , of whom roughly 60 survived to the end of the war .",
