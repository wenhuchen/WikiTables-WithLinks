The original and best-known lineup consisted of Stanley ( vocals and rhythm guitar ) , Simmons ( vocals and bass ) , Frehley ( lead guitar and vocals ) , and Criss ( drums and vocals ) . With their make-up and costumes , they took on the personae of comic book-style characters : the Starchild ( Stanley ) , the Demon ( Simmons ) , the Spaceman or Space Ace ( Frehley ) , and the Catman ( Criss ) . Due to creative differences , both Criss and Frehley had departed the group by 1982 . In 1983 , Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes , thus marking the beginning of the band 's unmasked era that would last for over a decade . They accordingly experienced a commercial resurgence , with the platinum certified album Lick It Up successfully introducing them to a new generation of fans , and their music videos received regular airplay on MTV . Eric Carr , who had replaced Criss in 1980 , died in 1991 of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer . In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s , the original lineup re-united in 1996 , which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes . The resulting Alive/Worldwide Tour was highly successful , grossing $ 143.7 million , making it their most successful tour to date .
