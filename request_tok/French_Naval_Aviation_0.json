  "/wiki/Breguet_Atlantic": "The Breguet Br.1150 Atlantic is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft designed and manufactured by French aircraft manufacturer Breguet Aviation . Designed in response to a 1958 NATO specification as a replacement for the Lockheed P2V Neptune , Breguet 's submission was declared the winner over several competing bids . To produce the Atlantic , a multinational consortium , Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tude et de Construction de Breguet Atlantic ( SECBAT ) , was established . During 1963 , an initial order for 60 Atlantics - 40 for France and 20 for Germany - was received . Follow-on orders from export customers followed shortly thereafter . It was first introduced to operational service during 1965 . The Atlantic has been operated by a number of countries , commonly performing maritime roles such as reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare . The Atlantic is also capable of carrying air-to-ground munitions to perform ground-attack missions ; a small number of aircraft were also equipped to perform ELINT operations . An updated version , the Atlantique 2 or ATL2 , was produced by Dassault Aviation for the French Navy in the 1980s . A further improved model , the Atlantique 3 , was proposed during the 1990s but ultimately unbuilt . Other operators of the Atlantic have included the German Navy , the Italian Air Force , the Pakistan Navy , and the Royal Netherlands Navy .",

  "/wiki/Dassault_Falcon_10": "The Dassault Myst\u00e8re/Falcon 10 is an early corporate jet aircraft developed by French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation . Despite its numbering sequence it was actually developed after the Falcon 20 , and although it is sometimes considered as a scaled-down version of that aircraft , it was totally redesigned with a non-circular fuselage , a new wing with slotted flaps , a split passenger door and many simplified circuits compared to the Falcon 20 . Production began in 1971 and ceased in 1989 , but it remains a popular business jet on the second hand market . By 2018 , Falcon 10s from the 1970s were priced at $ 300,000 to $ 600,000 .",
  "/wiki/Utility": "Within economics , the concept of utility is used to model worth or value . Its usage has evolved significantly over time . The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or satisfaction within the theory of utilitarianism by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill . The term has been adapted and reapplied within neoclassical economics , which dominates modern economic theory , as a utility function that represents a consumer 's preference ordering over a choice set . It is devoid of its original interpretation as a measurement of the pleasure or satisfaction obtained by the consumer from that choice .",

  "/wiki/Dassault_Falcon_20": "The Dassault Falcon 20 is a French business jet developed and manufactured by Dassault Aviation . The first business jet developed by the firm , it became the first of a family of business jets to be produced under the same name ; of these , both the smaller Falcon 10 and the larger trijet Falcon 50 were direct derivatives of the Falcon 20 . Initially known as the Dassault-Breguet Myst\u00e8re 20 , approval to proceed with development of the aircraft was issued during December 1961 . It is a low-wing monoplane design , powered by a pair of rear-mounted General Electric CF700 turbojet engines . On 4 May 1963 the prototype made its maiden flight . The first production aircraft was introduced on 3 June 1965 . On 10 June 1965 , French aviator Jacqueline Auriol achieved the women 's world speed record using the first prototype . As a result of an early distributor arrangement with American airline Pan American , American-delivered aircraft were marketed under the name Fan Jet Falcon ; it soon became popularly known as the Falcon 20 . American orders proved valuable early on ; by 1968 , Pan American Business Jets Division had placed orders for a combined total of 160 Falcon 20s . Further major orders were soon placed for the type by several operators , both civil and military ; amongst others , these included the French Navy , the United States Coast Guard , and Federal Express . An improved model of the aircraft , designated the Falcon 200 , was developed . This variant , powered by a pair of Garrett ATF3 engines , featured several major improvements to increase its range , capacity and comfort .",
  "/wiki/Dassault_Rafale": "The Dassault Rafale ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ \u0281afal ] , literally meaning gust of wind , and burst of fire in a more military sense ) is a French twin-engine , canard delta wing , multirole fighter aircraft designed and built by Dassault Aviation . Equipped with a wide range of weapons , the Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy , interdiction , aerial reconnaissance , ground support , in-depth strike , anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions . The Rafale is referred to as an omnirole aircraft by Dassault . In the late 1970s , the French Air Force and Navy were seeking to replace and consolidate their current fleets of aircraft . In order to reduce development costs and boost prospective sales , France entered into an arrangement with UK , Germany , Italy and Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose fighter , the Eurofighter Typhoon . Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing requirements led to France 's pursuit of its own development programme . Dassault built a technology demonstrator which first flew in July 1986 as part of an eight-year flight-test programme , paving the way for the go-ahead of the project . The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its era in that it is almost entirely built by one country , involving most of France 's major defence contractors , such as Dassault , Thales and Safran . Many of the aircraft 's avionics and features , such as direct voice input , the RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array ( AESA ) radar and the optronique secteur frontal infra-red search and track ( IRST ) sensor , were domestically developed and produced for the Rafale programme . Originally scheduled to enter service in 1996 , the Rafale suffered significant delays due to post-Cold War budget cuts and changes in priorities . The aircraft is available in three main variants : Rafale C single-seat land-based version , Rafale B twin-seat land-based version , and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based version . Introduced in 2001 , the Rafale is being produced for both the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in the French Navy .",

  "/wiki/Grumman_E-2C_Hawkeye": "The Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye is an American all-weather , carrier-capable tactical airborne early warning ( AEW ) aircraft . This twin-turboprop aircraft was designed and developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s by the Grumman Aircraft Company for the United States Navy as a replacement for the earlier , piston-engined E-1 Tracer , which was rapidly becoming obsolete . The aircraft 's performance has been upgraded with the E-2B , and E-2C versions , where most of the changes were made to the radar and radio communications due to advances in electronic integrated circuits and other electronics . The fourth major version of the Hawkeye is the E-2D , which first flew in 2007 . The E-2 was the first aircraft designed specifically for its role , as opposed to a modification of an existing airframe , such as the Boeing E-3 Sentry . Variants of the Hawkeye have been in continuous production since 1960 , giving it the longest production run of any carrier-based aircraft . The E-2 also received the nickname Super Fudd because it replaced the WF ( later E-1 ) Willy Fudd . In recent decades , the E-2 has been commonly referred to as the Hummer because of the distinctive sounds of its turboprop engines , quite unlike that of turbojet and turbofan jet engines . In addition to U.S. Navy service , smaller numbers of E-2s have been sold to the armed forces of Egypt , France , Israel , Japan , Mexico , Singapore , and Taiwan .",
  "/wiki/Airborne_early_warning_and_control": "An airborne early warning and control ( AEW & C ) system is an airborne radar picket system designed to detect aircraft , ships and vehicles at long ranges and perform command and control of the battlespace in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack aircraft strikes . AEW & C units are also used to carry out surveillance , including over ground targets and frequently perform C2BM ( command and control , battle management ) functions similar to an Air Traffic Controller given military command over other forces . When used at altitude , the radar on the aircraft allows the operators to detect and track targets and distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft much farther away than a similar ground-based radar . Like a ground-based radar , it can be detected by opposing forces , but because of its mobility , it is much less vulnerable to counter-attack . The first known aerial engagement with both opposing sides using Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft was in South Asia , during the February 27 , 2019 aerial engagement between India and Pakistan , with India using A-50I Phalcon AWACS and Pakistan using the Saab 2000 . AEW & C aircraft are used for both defensive and offensive air operations , and are to the NATO and US forces trained or integrated Air Forces what the combat information center is to a US Navy warship , plus a highly mobile and powerful radar platform . The system is used offensively to direct fighters to their target locations , and defensively , directing counterattacks on enemy forces , both air and ground . So useful is the advantage of command and control from a high altitude , the US Navy operates Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye AEW & C aircraft from its Supercarriers to augment and protect its carrier Command Information Centers ( CICs ) . The designation airborne early warning ( AEW ) was used for earlier similar aircraft , such as the Fairey Gannet AEW.3 and Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star , and continues to be used by the RAF for its Sentry AEW1 , while AEW & C ( airborne early warning and control ) emphasizes the command and control capabilities that may not be present on smaller or simpler radar picket aircraft . AWACS ( Airborne Warning and Control System ) is the name of the specific system installed in the E-3 and Japanese Boeing E-767 AEW & C airframes , but is often used as a general synonym for AEW & C .",

The NH90 has the distinction of being the first production helicopter to feature entirely fly-by-wire flight controls . There are two main variants , the Tactical Transport Helicopter ( TTH ) for army use and the navalised NATO Frigate Helicopter ( NFH ) ; each customer typically has various alterations and customisations made to their own NH90 fleets , such as different weapons , sensors and cabin arrangements , to meet their own specific requirements . In early service , the NH90 has suffered several teething issues , which has in turn delayed active deployment of the type by some operators .",
  "/wiki/Westland_Lynx": "The Westland Lynx is a British multi-purpose twin-engined military helicopter designed and built by Westland Helicopters at its factory in Yeovil . Originally intended as a utility craft for both civil and naval usage , military interest led to the development of both battlefield and naval variants . The Lynx went into operational usage in 1977 and was later adopted by the armed forces of over a dozen nations , primarily serving in the battlefield utility , anti-armour , search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare roles . The Lynx is a fully aerobatic helicopter with the ability to perform loops and rolls . In 1986 , a specially modified Lynx set the current F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale 's official airspeed record for helicopters ( category excludes compound helicopters ) at 400.87 km/h ( 249.09 mph ) , which remains unbroken as of 2019 . Several land and naval variants of the Lynx have been produced along with some major derivatives . The Westland 30 was produced as a civil utility helicopter ; it was not a commercial success and only a small number were built during the 1980s . In the 21st century , a modernised variant of the Lynx was designed as a multi-role combat helicopter , designated as the AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat ; the Wildcat is intended to replace existing Lynx helicopters . The Lynx remains in production by AgustaWestland , the successor to Westland Helicopters .",
  "/wiki/Attack_aircraft": "An attack aircraft , strike aircraft , or attack bomber , is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers , and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack . This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions , overlapping the tactical bomber mission . Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft . Fighter aircraft often carry out the attack role , although they would not be considered attack aircraft per se , although fighter-bomber conversions of those same aircraft would be considered part of the class . Strike fighters , which have effectively replaced the fighter-bomber and light bomber concepts , also differ little from the broad concept of an attack aircraft . The dedicated attack aircraft as a separate class existed primarily during and after World War II . The precise implementation varied from country to country , and was handled by a wide variety of designs . In the United States and Britain attack aircraft were generally light bombers or medium bombers , sometimes carrying heavier forward-firing weapons like the North American B-25G Mitchell and de Havilland Mosquito Tsetse . In Germany and the USSR , where they were known as Schlachtflugzeug ( battle aircraft ) or sturmovik ( storm trooper ) respectively , this role was carried out by purpose-designed and heavily armored aircraft such as the Henschel Hs 129 and Ilyushin Il-2 . The Germans and Soviets also used light bombers in this role : cannon-armed versions of the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka greatly outnumbered the Hs 129 , while the Petlyakov Pe-2 was used for this role in spite of not being specifically designed for it . In the latter part of World War II the fighter-bomber began to take over many attack roles , a transition that continued in the post-war era . Jet-powered examples were relatively rare but not unknown , such as the Blackburn Buccaneer ."
