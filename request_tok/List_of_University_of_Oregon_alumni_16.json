  "/wiki/Saudi_Arabia": "Saudi Arabia , [ c ] officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , [ d ] is a country in Western Asia constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula . With a land area of approximately 2,150,000 km2 ( 830,000 sq mi ) , Saudi Arabia is geographically the largest sovereign state in Western Asia , the second-largest in the Arab world ( after Algeria ) , the fifth-largest in Asia , and the 12th-largest in the world . Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north , Kuwait to the northeast , Qatar , Bahrain , and the United Arab Emirates to the east , Oman to the southeast and Yemen to the south ; it is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba . It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast , and most of its terrain consists of arid desert , lowland and mountains . As of October 2018 , the Saudi economy was the largest in the Middle East and the 18th largest in the world . Saudi Arabia also has one of the world 's youngest populations ; 50 percent of its 33.4 million people are under 25 years old . The territory that now constitutes Saudi Arabia was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations . The prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world . The world 's second-largest religion , Islam , emerged in modern-day Saudi Arabia . In the early 7th century , the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabia and created a single Islamic religious polity . Following his death in 632 , his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia , conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory ( from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to modern-day Pakistan in the East ) in a matter of decades . Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun ( 632-661 ) , Umayyad ( 661-750 ) , Abbasid ( 750-1517 ) and Fatimid ( 909-1171 ) caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia , Africa and Europe .",

Buxtun , then a 27-year-old social worker and epidemiologist in San Francisco , was hired by the Public Health Service in December 1965 to interview patients with sexually transmitted diseases ; in the course of his duties , he learned of the Tuskegee Experiment from co-workers . He later said - I did n't want to believe it . This was the Public Health Service . We did n't do things like that . In November 1966 , he filed an official protest on ethical grounds with the Service 's Division of Venereal Diseases ; this was rejected on the grounds that the Experiment was not yet complete . He filed another protest in November 1968 ; again , his concerns were ruled irrelevant . In 1972 , Buxtun leaked information on the Tuskegee Experiment to Jean Heller of the Washington Star . Heller 's story exposing the Experiment was published on July 25 , 1972 ; It became front-page news in the New York Times the following day . Senator Edward Kennedy called Congressional hearings , at which Buxtun and HEW officials testified and the Experiment was terminated shortly thereafter . Buxtun subsequently testified at the ensuing Congressional hearing . In May 1999 , Buxtun attended the launch of a memorial center and public exhibit to the experiment in Tuskegee .",
  "/wiki/Whistleblower": "A whistleblower ( also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower ) is a person who exposes secretive information or activity that is deemed illegal , unethical , or not correct within a private or public organization . The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways : violation of company policy/rules , law , regulation , or threat to public interest/national security , as well as fraud , and corruption . Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally . Internally , a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor . Externally , a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media , government , law enforcement , or those who are concerned . Whistleblowers , however , take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing . Because of this , a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers . Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers , but that protection can only go so far . Whistleblowers face legal action , criminal charges , social stigma , and termination from any position , office , or job . Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public . The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on : private sector , or public sector . Depending on many factors , both can have varying results .",

The purpose of this study was to observe the natural history of untreated syphilis ; the African American men in the study were only told they were receiving free health care from the Federal government of the United States . Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University , a historically black college in Alabama . Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished , African American sharecroppers from Macon County , Alabama . Of these men , 399 had latent syphilis and 201 did not have the disease . The men were given free medical care , meals and free burial insurance for participating in the study . The men were told that the study was only going to last six months , but it actually lasted 40 years . After funding for treatment was lost , the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated . None of the men were told that they had the disease , and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the men were told that they were being treated for bad blood , a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis , anemia and fatigue . Bad blood - specifically the collection of illnesses the term included - was a leading cause of death within the southern African American community . The 40-year Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male study was a major violation of ethical standards .",

The position was formed on October 1 , 1977 with the creation of the Department of Energy when President Jimmy Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act . Originally the post focused on energy production and regulation . The emphasis soon shifted to developing technology for better and more efficient energy sources as well as energy education . After the end of the Cold War , the department 's attention also turned toward radioactive waste disposal and maintenance of environmental quality . The current Secretary of Energy is Dan Brouillette .

  "/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan": "The presidency of Ronald Reagan began at noon EST on January 20 , 1981 , when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as the 40th President of the United States , and ended on January 20 , 1989 . Reagan , a Republican from California , took office following a landslide victory over Democratic incumbent President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election . Reagan was succeeded by his Vice President , George H. W. Bush , who won the 1988 presidential election with Reagan 's support . Reagan 's 1980 election resulted from a dramatic conservative shift to the right in American politics , including a loss of confidence in liberal , New Deal , and Great Society programs and priorities that had dominated the national agenda since the 1930s . Domestically , the Reagan administration enacted a major tax cut , sought to cut non-military spending , and eliminated federal regulations . The administration 's economic policies , known as Reaganomics , were inspired by supply-side economics . The combination of tax cuts and an increase in defense spending led to budget deficits , and the federal debt increased significantly during Reagan 's tenure . Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( which simplified the tax code by reducing rates and removing several tax breaks ) and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ( which enacted sweeping changes to U.S. immigration law and granted amnesty to three million illegal immigrants ) . Reagan also appointed more federal judges than any other president , including four Supreme Court Justices . Reagan 's foreign policy stance was resolutely anti-communist ; its plan of action , known as the Reagan Doctrine , sought to roll back the global influence of the Soviet Union in an attempt to end the Cold War . Under this doctrine , the Reagan administration initiated a massive buildup of the United States military ; promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems ; and , in 1983 , undertook an invasion of Grenada , the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the Vietnam War . The administration also created controversy by granting aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow leftist governments , particularly in war-torn Central America and Afghanistan .",

  "/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency": "The Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States , tasked with gathering , processing , and analyzing national security information from around the world , primarily through the use of human intelligence ( HUMINT ) . As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community ( IC ) , the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States . Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates . The CIA has increasingly expanded its role , including covert paramilitary operations . One of its largest divisions , the Information Operations Center ( IOC ) , has shifted focus from counter-terrorism to offensive cyber-operations .",

  "/wiki/Attorney_General": "In most common law jurisdictions , the attorney general or attorney-general ( sometimes abbreviated AG ) is the main legal advisor to the government . The plural is attorneys general or attorney generals . In some jurisdictions , attorneys general also have executive responsibility for law enforcement , prosecutions or even responsibility for legal affairs generally . In practice , the extent to which the attorney general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions , and even between individual office-holders within the same jurisdiction , often depending on the level and nature of the office-holder 's prior legal experience . Where the attorney general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general ( as is the case , for example , with the United States Attorney General or the Attorney-General for Australia , and the respective attorneys general of the states in each country ) , the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to that of a Minister of Justice in some other countries . The term was originally used to refer to any person who holds a general power of attorney to represent a principal in all matters . In the common law tradition , anyone who represents the state , especially in criminal prosecutions , is such an attorney . Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general , anyone who came to represent the state in the same way could , in the past , be referred to as such , even if only for a particular case . Today , however , in most jurisdictions , the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state , sovereign or other member of the royal family . Civil law jurisdictions have similar offices , which may be variously called public prosecutor general , procurators , advocates general , public attorneys , and other titles . Many of these offices also use attorney general or attorney-general as the English translation of the title , although because of different historical provenance , the nature of such offices is usually different from that of attorneys-general in common law jurisdictions .",

The founding of the party was prompted in part due to concerns about the Nixon administration , the Vietnam War , conscription , and the introduction of fiat money . The party generally promotes a classical liberal platform , in contrast to the Democratic Party 's modern liberalism and progressivism and the Republican Party 's conservatism . Gary Johnson , the party 's presidential nominee in 2012 and 2016 , states that the Libertarian Party is more culturally liberal than Democrats , and more fiscally conservative than Republicans . Current fiscal policy positions include lowering taxes , abolishing the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) , decreasing the national debt , allowing people to opt out of Social Security and eliminating the welfare state , in part by utilizing private charities . Current cultural policy positions include ending the prohibition of illegal drugs , advocating criminal justice reform , supporting same-sex marriage , ending capital punishment and supporting gun ownership rights .

Beginning in the late 19th century , besides women working for broad-based economic and political equality and for social reforms , women sought to change voting laws to allow them to vote . National and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts towards that objective , especially the International Woman Suffrage Alliance ( founded in 1904 in Berlin , Germany ) , as well as for equal civil rights for women . Women who owned property gained the right to vote in the Isle of Man in 1881 , and in 1893 , women in the then British colony of New Zealand were granted the right to vote . In Australia , women progressively gained the right to vote between 1894 and 1911 ( federally in 1902 ) . Most major Western powers extended voting rights to women in the interwar period , including Canada ( 1917 ) , Britain and Germany ( 1918 ) , Austria and the Netherlands ( 1919 ) and the United States ( 1920 ) . Notable exceptions in Europe were France , where women could not vote until 1944 , Greece ( 1952 ) , and Switzerland ( 1971 ) .

His ultimate defeat by Republican Lee Johnson , who garnered some 80,000 more votes than Thornton in the 1968 general election , became a matter for the courts . Thornton challenged the outcome by bringing a suit charging that Johnson had violated campaign spending limits and falsified a report by signing the blank form . Johnson admitted he had done so in anticipation of being out of the country when the report was to be filed . A three-judge panel in Marion County ruled in favor of Thornton , invalidating the election results and awarding Thornton an additional term .

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan .
