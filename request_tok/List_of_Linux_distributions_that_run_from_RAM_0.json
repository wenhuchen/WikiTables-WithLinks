  "/wiki/Alpine_Linux": "Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution based on musl and BusyBox , designed for security , simplicity , and resource efficiency . It uses a hardened kernel and compiles all user-space binaries as position-independent executables with stack-smashing protection . Because of its small size , it is heavily used in containers providing quick boot-up times . The postmarketOS project which is designed to run on mobile devices is based on Alpine Linux .",
  "/wiki/CD": "Compact disc ( CD ) is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by Philips and Sony and released in 1982 . The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ( CD-DA ) but was later adapted for storage of data ( CD-ROM ) . Several other formats were further derived from these , including write-once audio and data storage ( CD-R ) , rewritable media ( CD-RW ) , Video Compact Disc ( VCD ) , Super Video Compact Disc ( SVCD ) , Photo CD , PictureCD , Compact Disc-Interactive ( CD-i ) , and Enhanced Music CD . The first commercially available audio CD player , the Sony CDP-101 , was released October 1982 in Japan . Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres ( 4.7 in ) and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700 MiB of data . The Mini CD has various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 millimetres ( 2.4 to 3.1 in ) ; they are sometimes used for CD singles , storing up to 24 minutes of audio , or delivering device drivers . At the time of the technology 's introduction in 1982 , a CD could store much more data than a personal computer hard drive , which would typically hold 10 MB . By 2010 , hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs , while their prices had plummeted to commodity level . In 2004 , worldwide sales of audio CDs , CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs . By 2007 , 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide . From the early 2000s , CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution , with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak ; however , they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry . In 2014 , revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time .",
  "/wiki/USB_flash_drive": "A USB flash drive [ note 1 ] is a data storage device that includes flash memory with an integrated USB interface . It is typically removable , rewritable and much smaller than an optical disc . Most weigh less than 30 g ( 1 oz ) . Since first appearing on the market in late 2000 , as with virtually all other computer memory devices , storage capacities have risen while prices have dropped . As of March 2016 [ update ] , flash drives with anywhere from 8 to 256 gigabytes ( GB ) were frequently sold , while 512 GB and 1 terabyte ( TB ) units were less frequent . As of 2018 , 2 TB flash drives were the largest available in terms of storage capacity . Some allow up to 100,000 write/erase cycles , depending on the exact type of memory chip used , and are thought to last between 10 and 100 years under normal circumstances ( shelf storage time ) . USB flash drives are often used for storage , data back-up and transfer of computer files . Compared with floppy disks or CDs , they are smaller , faster , have significantly more capacity , and are more durable due to a lack of moving parts . Additionally , they are immune to electromagnetic interference ( unlike floppy disks ) , and are unharmed by surface scratches ( unlike CDs ) . Until about 2005 , most desktop and laptop computers were supplied with floppy disk drives in addition to USB ports , but floppy disk drives became obsolete after widespread adoption of USB ports and the larger USB drive capacity compared to the 1.44 megabyte ( 1440 kibibyte ) 3.5-inch floppy disk . USB flash drives use the USB mass storage device class standard , supported natively by modern operating systems such as Windows , Linux , macOS and other Unix-like systems , as well as many BIOS boot ROMs .",
  "/wiki/Hard_disk_drive": "A hard disk drive ( HDD ) , hard disk , hard drive , or fixed disk [ b ] is an electro-mechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital data using one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material . The platters are paired with magnetic heads , usually arranged on a moving actuator arm , which read and write data to the platter surfaces . Data is accessed in a random-access manner , meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order . HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage , retaining stored data even when powered off . Introduced by IBM in 1956 , HDDs were the dominant secondary storage device for general-purpose computers beginning in the early 1960s . HDDs maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers , though personal computing devices produced in large volume , like cell phones and tablets , rely on flash products . More than 224 companies have produced HDDs historically , though after extensive industry consolidation most units are manufactured by Seagate , Toshiba , and Western Digital . HDDs dominate the volume of storage produced ( exabytes per year ) for servers . Though production is growing slowly , sales revenues and unit shipments are declining because solid-state drives ( SSDs ) have higher data-transfer rates , higher areal storage density , better reliability , and much lower latency and access times . The revenues for SSDs , most of which use NAND , slightly exceed those for HDDs . Flash storage products had more than twice the revenue of hard disk drives as of 2017 . Though SSDs have four to nine times higher cost per bit , they are replacing HDDs in applications where speed , power consumption , small size , high capacity and durability are important .",

  "/wiki/Slackware": "Slackware is a Linux distribution created by Patrick Volkerding in 1993 . Originally based on Softlanding Linux System , Slackware has been the basis for many other Linux distributions , most notably the first versions of SUSE Linux distributions , and is the oldest distribution that is still maintained . Slackware aims for design stability and simplicity and to be the most Unix-like Linux distribution . It makes as few modifications as possible to software packages from upstream and tries not to anticipate use cases or preclude user decisions . In contrast to most modern Linux distributions , Slackware provides no graphical installation procedure and no automatic dependency resolution of software packages . It uses plain text files and only a small set of shell scripts for configuration and administration . Without further modification it boots into a command-line interface environment . Because of its many conservative and simplistic features , Slackware is often considered to be most suitable for advanced and technically inclined Linux users . Slackware is available for the IA-32 and x86_64 architectures , with a port to the ARM architecture . While Slackware is mostly free and open source software , it does not have a formal bug tracking facility or public code repository , with releases periodically announced by Volkerding .

  "/wiki/DVD": "DVD ( an abbreviation of digital versatile disc ) is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed in 1995 and released in late 1996 . The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players . DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions . Prerecorded DVDs are mass-produced using molding machines that physically stamp data onto the DVD . Such discs are a form of DVD-ROM because data can only be read and not written or erased . Blank recordable DVD discs ( DVD-R and DVD+R ) can be recorded once using a DVD recorder and then function as a DVD-ROM . Rewritable DVDs ( DVD-RW , DVD+RW , and DVD-RAM ) can be recorded and erased many times . DVDs are used in DVD-Video consumer digital video format and in DVD-Audio consumer digital audio format as well as for authoring DVD discs written in a special AVCHD format to hold high definition material ( often in conjunction with AVCHD format camcorders ) .
