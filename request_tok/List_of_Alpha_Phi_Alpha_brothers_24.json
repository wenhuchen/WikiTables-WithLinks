Following his demise , his few remaining adherents elected to reunite with the main Cutlerite church in Independence , Missouri . Born and raised in the Cutlerite community in Clitherall , Minnesota , Fletcher elected not to relocate with the main body when that group moved the church headquarters to Independence in the 1920s . Following the death of President Emery Fletcher in 1953 , the Independence church , which then contained the majority of Cutlerite members , elected Erle Whiting as the new President of the Church . This was in keeping with a Cutlerite tradition that passed the presidency of the church to the former leader 's First Counselor , subject to the approval of the membership . Clyde Fletcher and the Cutlerite remnant in Minnesota did not approve of this step , and Fletcher was accordingly elected president of his congregation in Clitherall , which he subsequently claimed to be the sole legitimate continuation of the Cutlerite organization . Fletcher named his church the True Church of Jesus Christ ( Cutlerite ) , and began a lengthy court battle with the Independence organization over church properties in Minnesota . A Minnesota court finally ruled in favor of the Independence church in 1966 , giving them sole control over all Cutlerite properties and church records . Fletcher refused to accept the legitimacy of the Independence organization , however , and remained at the head of his church ( which was headquartered in the Cutlerite meetinghouse in Clitherall ) until his death in 1969 . To the end of his life , he continued to claim that his was the only true Cutlerite sect , and the only true church on earth . Fletcher did not change any of the distinctive beliefs of the Cutlerite church ; his organization remained exactly identical to the main body in Independence in every respect save leadership . Following Fletcher 's death , the few remaining members of his organization elected to accept an offer to return to the Independence church , which led to the folding of Fletcher 's church and the healing of the schism he had provoked .",

These Games , which were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States , marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens - the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games . They were also the first since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics , under a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating , even-numbered years . More than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports , including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball , mountain biking , and softball , as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing and women 's football ( soccer ) . 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debut in Atlanta , including eleven former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations . The hosting United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals , and the most gold ( 44 ) and silver ( 32 ) medals out of all countries . The U.S. topped the medal count for the first time since 1984 , and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics . Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi - who became the first men 's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal , Donovan Bailey - who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men 's 100 meters , and Lilia Podkopayeva - who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics . The festivities were marred by violence on July 27 , when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park - a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games ' festivities , killing 1 and injuring 111 .

He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors .",
