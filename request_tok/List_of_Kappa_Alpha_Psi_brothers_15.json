  "/wiki/Gold_medalist": "A gold medal is a medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field .

  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people , usually wearing protective gloves , throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring . Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games - it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing , disqualification of an opponent , or resignation of an opponent . When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing , the judges ' scorecards determine the victor . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , professional bouts are considered a draw . In Olympic boxing , because a winner must be declared , judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria . While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history , the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC . The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece , where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules .",
  "/wiki/Ph.D": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries . PhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields . As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree .
