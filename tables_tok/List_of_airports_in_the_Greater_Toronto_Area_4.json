  "intro": "The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) contains ten airports, eight heliports, and one water aerodrome. These aviation installments are situated within and around Toronto and its neighbouring cities, serving airline passengers, regional air travel and commercial cargo transportation. Toronto Pearson International Airport, located mainly in Mississauga, is the busiest airport in Canada and hosts international travel with various airlines. Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport on the Toronto Islands is a regional airport, providing regular services to U.S. destinations. John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in Hamilton is a base for low-cost carriers that fly domestic and transatlantic routes. Region of Waterloo International Airport in Waterloo also offers domestic air routes. Pearson, Bishop and Hamilton combined served over 53 million passengers in 2018, making Toronto the world's 31st busiest city airport system in the world. Heliports and water aerodromes are mostly for private use only, mainly by institutions and medical services."
