Construction of the canal involved some major feats of civil engineering , and led to the development of some new technologies , particularly in rail transport . Its operation stimulated the city 's growth and encouraged settlement in the sparsely populated region . Unlike many other canals of that era , the canal remained a profitable private operation for most of its existence . For these reasons , the canal was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968 . The canal was abandoned in the early 20th century , and much of it was subsequently drained and filled . A few fragments remain in New York and Pennsylvania , and are in use as parks and historic sites .",
