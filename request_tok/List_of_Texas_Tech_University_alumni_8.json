  "/wiki/Computer_scientist": "A computer scientist is a person who has acquired the knowledge of computer science , the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application . Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computer systems , as opposed to the hardware side on which computer engineers mainly focus ( although there is overlap ) . Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas ( such as algorithm and data structure development and design , software engineering , information theory , database theory , computational complexity theory , numerical analysis , programming language theory , computer graphics , and computer vision ) , their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive . A primary goal of computer scientists is to develop or validate models , often mathematical , to describe the properties of computer-based systems ( processors , programs , computers interacting with people , computers interacting with other computers , etc . ) with an overall objective of discovering designs that yield useful benefits ( faster , smaller , cheaper , more precise , etc . ) .",

  "/wiki/Tornadogenesis": "Tornadogenesis is the process by which a tornado forms . There are many types of tornadoes and these vary in methods of formation . Despite ongoing scientific study and high-profile research projects such as VORTEX , tornadogenesis is a volatile process and the intricacies of many of the mechanisms of tornado formation are still poorly understood . A tornado is a violently rotating column of air in contact with the surface and a cumuliform cloud base . Tornado formation is caused by the stretching of environmental and/or storm-induced vorticity that tightens it into an intense vortex . There are various ways this may come about and thus various forms and sub-forms of tornadoes . Although each tornado is unique , most kinds of tornadoes go through a life cycle of formation , maturation , and dissipation . The process by which a tornado dissipates or decays , occasionally conjured as tornadolysis , is of particular interest for study as is tornadogenesis , longevity , and intensity ."
