It has been guarded by the same family for over 250 years . Its guardians have traditionally only shown the cloak to recognized leaders of Afghanistan , although in times of great crisis such as natural disasters , it has been publicly displayed as a means of reassurance . The cloak was given to Amir Ahmad Shah Durrani ( regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan ) by Amir Murad Beg of Bukhara ( in modern Uzbekistan ) in 1768 in order to solidify a treaty between the two leaders . An alternate account states that when Ahmad Shah had traveled to Bukhara , he saw the cloak of Muhammad . He then decided to take the artifact with him to Kandahar , and asked whether he could borrow the cloak from its keepers . They , worrying that he might try to remove it from Bukhara , told him it could not be taken from the city .

According to Islamic doctrine , he was a prophet , sent to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached previously by Adam , Abraham , Moses , Jesus , and other prophets . He is viewed as the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam , though some modern denominations diverge from this belief . [ n 3 ] Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity , with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief . He is referred to by many appellations , including Messenger of Allah , The Prophet Muhammad , Allah 's Apostle , Last Prophet of Islam , and others ; there are also many variant spellings of Muhammad , such as Mohamet , Mahamad , Muhamad , and many others . Born approximately 570 CE ( Year of the Elephant ) in the Arabian city of Mecca , Muhammad was orphaned at the age of six . He was raised under the care of his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib , and upon his death , by his uncle Abu Talib . In later years , he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer . When he was 40 , Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave , and receiving his first revelation from God . Three years later , in 610 , Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly , proclaiming that God is One , that complete submission ( isl\u0101m ) to God is the right way of life ( d\u012bn ) , and that he was a prophet and messenger of God , similar to the other prophets in Islam . The followers of Muhammad were initially few in number , and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists . He sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615 to shield them from prosecution , before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina ( then known as Yathrib ) in 622 .",
