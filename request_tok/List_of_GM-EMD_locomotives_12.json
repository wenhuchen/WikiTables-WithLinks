  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",
  "/wiki/Beep_(SWBLW)": "The Beep ( also referred to as the SWBLW ) is an individual switcher locomotive built in 1970 by the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at its Cleburne , Texas , workshops . Technically a rebuild , the Beep ( a portmanteau of Baldwin Geep , whose official designation was derived from SWitcher , Baldwin Locomotive Works ) originally entered service on the Santa Fe as a Baldwin Model VO-1000 . Following its successful CF7 capital rebuilding program , the company hoped to determine if remanufacturing its aging , non-EMD end cab switchers by fitting them with new EMD prime movers was an economically viable proposition . The conversion procedure proved too costly and only the one unit was modified . As of end of 2008 per Trains Magazine March 2009 , this locomotive was retired and stored operational at Topeka , Kansas . In May 2009 the unit was donated to the Western America Railroad Museum in Barstow , California .",
  "/wiki/EMD_567": "The EMD 567 is a line of large medium-speed diesel engines built by General Motors ' Electro-Motive Division . This engine , which succeeded Winton 's 201A , was used in EMD 's locomotives from 1938 until its replacement in 1966 by the EMD 645 . It has a bore of 8 1\u20442 in ( 216 mm ) , a stroke of 10 in ( 254 mm ) and a displacement of 567 cu in ( 9.29 L ) per cylinder . Like the Winton 201A , the EMD 645 and the EMD 710 , the EMD 567 is a two-stroke engine . EMD 's chief competitor , GE , now makes EMD-compatible replacement parts .",
  "/wiki/CF7": "The CF7 is an EMD F-unit railroad locomotive that has had its streamlined carbody removed and replaced with a custom-made , general purpose body in order to adapt the unit for switching duty . All of the conversions were performed by the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in their Cleburne , Texas workshops between October , 1970 and March , 1978 . The program was initiated in response to a system-wide need for more than 200 additional four-axle diesel road switchers to meet projected motive power demands on branch lines and secondary main lines . Santa Fe 's aging fleet of 200-series F-units were in dire need of overhaul , and were not suitable for switching service in their original configuration due to the poor visibility resulting from their full-width carbody ; the engineer was required to stick their head out of the window in order to see the end of the train or locomotive when coupling and uncoupling cars . As new , state-of-the-art locomotives cost upwards of $ 150,000 each at the time , Santa Fe elected to experiment with modifying its existing F-units to serve their purpose , which they hoped they could accomplish for around $ 60,000 each . Changes in business philosophy led the company to sell off its entire CF7 inventory by 1987 , with most of the units ( all but nine ) ending up in the hands of regional and short-line railroads , and a few excursion lines . A number remain in service today . [ vague ]",

  "/wiki/GP16": "The EMD GP16 was a series of rebuilt road switcher diesel-electric locomotives , a result of a remanufacturing program initiated by the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad ( SCL ) in an effort to spare the cost of purchasing new motive power in the late 1970s . This involved the rebuilding of their aging fleet of EMD GP7 , GP9 , and GP18 road switchers ( many of which were over twenty years old ) . 155 locomotives ( 122 GP7 , 31 GP9 and two GP18 ) were rebuilt by the SCL .",
  "/wiki/EMD_645": "The EMD 645 family of diesel engines was designed and manufactured by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors . While the 645 series was intended primarily for locomotive , marine and stationary engine use , one 16-cylinder version powered the 33-19 Titan prototype haul truck designed by GM 's Terex division . The 645 series was an evolution of the earlier 567 series and a precursor to the later 710 series . First introduced in 1965 , the EMD 645 series remained in production on a by-request basis long after it was replaced by the 710 , and most 645 service parts are still in production . The EMD 645 engine series is currently supported by Electro-Motive Diesel , Inc. , which purchased the assets of the Electro-Motive Division from General Motors in 2005 . In 1951 , E. W. Kettering wrote a paper for the ASME entitled , History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine , which goes into great detail about the technical obstacles that were encountered during the development of the 567 engine . These same considerations apply to the 645 and 710 , as these engines were a logical extension of the 567C , by applying a cylinder bore increase , 645 , and a cylinder bore increase and a stroke increase , 710 , to achieve a greater power output , without changing the external size of the engines , or their weight , thereby achieving significant improvements in horsepower per unit volume and horsepower per unit weight .",
