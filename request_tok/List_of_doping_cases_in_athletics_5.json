The capital and largest city is Dublin , which is located on the eastern side of the island . Around a third of the country 's population of 4.9 million people resides in the greater Dublin area . The sovereign state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland , a part of the United Kingdom . It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the Celtic Sea to the south , St George 's Channel to the south-east , and the Irish Sea to the east . It is a unitary , parliamentary republic . The legislature , the Oireachtas , consists of a lower house , D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann , an upper house , Seanad \u00c9ireann , and an elected President ( Uachtar\u00e1n ) who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state , but with some important powers and duties . The head of government is the Taoiseach ( Prime Minister , literally 'Chief ' , a title not used in English ) , who is elected by the D\u00e1il and appointed by the President ; the Taoiseach in turn appoints other government ministers . The state was created as the Irish Free State in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . It had the status of Dominion until 1937 when a new constitution was adopted , in which the state was named Ireland and effectively became a republic , with an elected non-executive president as head of state . It was officially declared a republic in 1949 , following the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 . Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955 .",

Low levels of EPO ( around 10 mU/mL ) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover . Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO ( up to 10 000 mU/mL ) include any anemia , and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease . Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule . It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver . Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period ; renal production predominates in adulthood . It is homologous with thrombopoietin . Exogenous erythropoietin , recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) : two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta . ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease , anemia in myelodysplasia , and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy . Risks of therapy include death , myocardial infarction , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and tumor recurrence . Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL : this is to be avoided . rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug .",

The prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world . The world 's second-largest religion , Islam , emerged in modern-day Saudi Arabia . In the early 7th century , the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabia and created a single Islamic religious polity . Following his death in 632 , his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia , conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory ( from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to modern-day Pakistan in the East ) in a matter of decades . Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun ( 632-661 ) , Umayyad ( 661-750 ) , Abbasid ( 750-1517 ) and Fatimid ( 909-1171 ) caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia , Africa and Europe .",
  "/wiki/Amphetamine": "Amphetamine [ note 1 ] ( contracted from alpha-methylphenethylamine ) is a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , narcolepsy , and obesity . Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers : [ note 2 ] levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine . Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical , the racemic free base , which is equal parts of the two enantiomers , levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine , in their pure amine forms . The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers , or to either of them alone . Historically , it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression . Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a prescription drug in many countries , and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use . [ sources 1 ] The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine , a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions . Currently , pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine , Adderall , [ note 3 ] dextroamphetamine , or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine . Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain , with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems . [ sources 2 ] At therapeutic doses , amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria , change in desire for sex , increased wakefulness , and improved cognitive control . It induces physical effects such as improved reaction time , fatigue resistance , and increased muscle strength .",

  "/wiki/Testosterone": "Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid . In male humans , testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate , as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass , and the growth of body hair . In addition , testosterone is involved in health and well-being , and the prevention of osteoporosis . Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss . Testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively . It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites . It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor . In humans and most other vertebrates , testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and , to a lesser extent , the ovaries of females . On average , in adult males , levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females . As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced , the daily production is about 20 times greater in men . Females are also more sensitive to the hormone . In addition to its role as a natural hormone , testosterone is used as a medication in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men , transgender hormone therapy for transgender men , and breast cancer in women .",

Its population is approximately 10.7 million as of 2018 ; Athens , the nation 's capital , is its largest city , followed by Thessaloniki . Situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula , Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe , Asia , and Africa . It shares land borders with Albania to the northwest , North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north , and Turkey to the northeast . The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland , the Ionian Sea to the west , the Cretan Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km ( 8,498 mi ) in length , featuring many islands , of which 227 are inhabited . Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous , with Mount Olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres ( 9,573 ft ) . The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions : Macedonia , Central Greece , the Peloponnese , Thessaly , Epirus , the Aegean Islands ( including the Dodecanese and Cyclades ) , Thrace , Crete , and the Ionian Islands . Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilisation , being the birthplace of democracy , Western philosophy , Western literature , historiography , political science , major scientific and mathematical principles , Western drama and the Olympic Games . From the eighth century B.C. , the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states , known as poleis ( singular polis ) , which spanned the entire Mediterranean region and the Black Sea . Philip of Macedon united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC , with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world , from the eastern Mediterranean to India . Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century B.C. , becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor , the Byzantine Empire , which adopted the Greek language and culture .",

Peripheral vascular resistance falls during the infusion of 1-8 mg etilefrine but begins to rise at higher dosage . Marked falls in pulse rate , cardiac output , stroke volume and peripheral bloodflow , accompanied by rises in mean arterial pressure , occur when etilefrine is infused after administration of intravenous propranolol 2,5 mg .

  "/wiki/Ephedrine": "Ephedrine is a medication and stimulant . It is often used to prevent low blood pressure during spinal anesthesia . It has also been used for asthma , narcolepsy , and obesity but is not the preferred treatment . It is of unclear benefit in nasal congestion . It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle , vein , or just under the skin . Onset with intravenous use is fast , while injection into a muscle can take 20 minutes , and by mouth can take an hour for effect . When given by injection it lasts about an hour and when taken by mouth it can last up to four hours . Common side effects include trouble sleeping , anxiety , headache , hallucinations , high blood pressure , fast heart rate , loss of appetite , and inability to urinate . Serious side effects include stroke , heart attack , and abuse . While likely safe in pregnancy , its use in this population is poorly studied . Use during breastfeeding is not recommended .

It was commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter cough and cold preparations . In veterinary medicine , it is used to control urinary incontinence in dogs . PPA is also known as \u03b2-hydroxyamphetamine , and is a member of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes . It is closely related to the cathinones ( \u03b2-ketoamphetamines ) . The compound exists as four stereoisomers , which include d- and l-norephedrine and d- and l-norpseudoephedrine . d-Norpseudoephedrine is also known as cathine , and is found naturally in Catha edulis ( khat ) . Pharmaceutical drug preparations of PPA have varied in their stereoisomer composition in different countries , which may explain differences in misuse and side effect profiles . Analogues of PPA include ephedrine , pseudoephedrine , amphetamine , methamphetamine , and cathinone . Although originally thought to act as a direct agonist of adrenergic receptors , PPA was subsequently found to show only weak or negligible affinity for these receptors , and has been instead characterized as an indirect sympathomimetic which acts by inducing norepinephrine release and thereby activating adrenergic receptors . It was patented in 1938 . In the United States , PPA is no longer sold due to a purported increased risk of stroke in younger women .",

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations . Beginning in the 1840s , the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations . The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962 .

  "/wiki/Anabolic_steroids": "Anabolic steroids , also known more properly as anabolic-androgenic steroids ( AAS ) , are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone . They are anabolic and increase protein within cells , especially in skeletal muscles , and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects , including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair .

Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists , the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone . AAS were synthesized in the 1930s , and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite , induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions , such as cancer and AIDS . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS , in the presence of adequate diet , can contribute to increases in body weight , often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals . Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS . These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels ( increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein ) , acne , high blood pressure , liver damage ( mainly with most oral AAS ) , and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart . These risks are further increased when , as they often do , athletes take steroids alongside other drugs , causing significantly more damage to their bodies . The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes . Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS . In women and children , AAS can cause irreversible masculinization ."
