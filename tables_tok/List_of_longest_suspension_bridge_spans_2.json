  "intro": "The world's longest suspension bridges are listed according to the length of their main span (i.e. the length of suspended roadway between the bridge's towers). The length of main span is the most common method of comparing the sizes of suspension bridges, often correlating with the height of the towers and the engineering complexity involved in designing and constructing the bridge. If one bridge has a longer span than another it does not necessarily mean that the bridge is longer from shore to shore (or from abutment to abutment). Suspension bridges have the longest spans of any type of bridge. Cable-stayed bridges, the next longest design, are practical for spans up to just over 1 kilometre. Therefore, the 17 longest bridges on this list are all currently the 17 longest spans of all types of vehicular bridges (other than floating pontoon bridges). Since 1998 Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge in Japan holds the record with its span of 1,991 metres (6,532 ft). The \u00c7anakkale 1915 Bridge of the Dardanelles, currently under construction in Turkey, is expected to surpass it with a span of 2,023 metres (6,637 ft)."
