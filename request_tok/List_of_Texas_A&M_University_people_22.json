  "/wiki/Norman_Borlaug": "Norman Ernest Borlaug ( /\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0rl\u0254\u02d0\u0261/ ; March 25 , 1914 - September 12 , 2009 ) was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed the Green Revolution . Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work , including the Nobel Peace Prize , the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal . Borlaug received his B.S . in forestry in 1937 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942 . He took up an agricultural research position in Mexico , where he developed semi-dwarf , high-yield , disease-resistant wheat varieties . During the mid-20th century , Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico , Pakistan , and India . As a result , Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963 . Between 1965 and 1970 , wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India , greatly improving the food security in those nations . Borlaug was often called the father of the Green Revolution , and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation . According to Jan Douglas , executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation , the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook 's 1997 article Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity . The article states that the form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths . He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply .",
  "/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom": "The Presidential Medal of Freedom is an award bestowed by the president of the United States . The Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal are the highest civilian awards of the United States . The presidential medal seeks to recognize those people who have made an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States , world peace , cultural or other significant public or private endeavors . The award is not limited to U.S. citizens and , while it is a civilian award , it can also be awarded to military personnel and worn on the uniform . It was established in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy , superseding the Medal of Freedom that was established by President Harry S. Truman in 1945 to honor civilian service during World War II .",
  "/wiki/Congressional_Gold_Medal": "A Congressional Gold Medal is an award bestowed by the United States Congress . The congressional practice of issuing gold medals to occasionally honor recipients from the military began during the American Revolution . Later the practice extended to individuals in all walks of life and in the late 20th century also to groups . The Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the highest civilian awards in the United States . The congressional medal seeks to honor those , individually or as a group , who have performed an achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient 's field long after the achievement . However , There are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals . When a Congressional Gold Medal has been deemed appropriate , Congress has , by legislative action , provided for the creation of a medal on an ad hoc basis . Thus , there are generally fewer gold medals than presidential medals . U.S. citizenship is not a requirement . As of April 4 , 2019 , 163 institutions , people , or events have been awarded a Congressional Gold Medal .",
