  "/wiki/Treasury_of_Atreus": "The Treasury of Atreus or Tomb of Agamemnon is a large tholos or beehive tomb on Panagitsa Hill at Mycenae , Greece , constructed during the Bronze Age around 1250 BC . The stone lintel above the doorway weighs 120 tons , with approximate dimensions 8.3 x 5.2 x 1.2m , the largest in the world . The tomb was used for an unknown period . Mentioned by the Roman geographer Pausanias in the 2nd century AD , it was still visible in 1879 when the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered the shaft graves under the agora in the Acropolis at Mycenae . The tomb perhaps held the remains of the sovereign who completed the reconstruction of the fortress or one of his successors . The grave is in the style of the other tholoi of Mycenaean Greece , of which there are nine in total around the citadel of Mycenae and many more in the Argolid . However , in its monumental shape and grandeur it is one of the most impressive monuments surviving from the Mycenaean period . The tomb has probably no relationship with either Atreus or Agamemnon - legendary rulers of Mycenae or Argos in the works of Homer , in the Epic Cycle , and the Oresteia - as archaeologists believe that the Mycenaean sovereign buried there ruled at an earlier date than king ; it was named thus by Heinrich Schliemann and the name has been used ever since . [ citation needed ] The historicity of the Trojan War , to which Schliemann sought to connect both Mycenae and Hisarlik , is a matter of long-standing and ongoing debate .",
  "/wiki/Mycenae": "Mycenae ( Ancient Greek : \u039c\u03c5\u03ba\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 or \u039c\u03c5\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 , Myc\u0113n\u0113 ) is an archaeological site near Mykines in Argolis , north-eastern Peloponnese , Greece . It is located about 120 kilometres ( 75 miles ) south-west of Athens ; 11 kilometres ( 7 miles ) north of Argos ; and 48 kilometres ( 30 miles ) south of Corinth . The site is 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) inland from the Saronic Gulf and built upon a hill rising 900 feet above sea level . In the second millennium BC , Mycenae was one of the major centres of Greek civilization , a military stronghold which dominated much of southern Greece , Crete , the Cyclades and parts of southwest Anatolia . The period of Greek history from about 1600 BC to about 1100 BC is called Mycenaean in reference to Mycenae . At its peak in 1350 BC , the citadel and lower town had a population of 30,000 and an area of 32 hectares . The first correct identification of Mycenae in modern literature was during a survey conducted by Francesco Grimani , commissioned by the Provveditore Generale of the Kingdom of the Morea in 1700 , who used Pausanias 's description of the Lion Gate to identify the ruins of Mycenae .",
  "/wiki/Corbel_arch": "A corbel arch ( or corbeled / corbelled arch ) is an arch-like construction method that uses the architectural technique of corbeling to span a space or void in a structure , such as an entranceway in a wall or as the span of a bridge . A corbel vault uses this technique to support the superstructure of a building 's roof . A corbel arch is constructed by offsetting successive courses of stone ( or brick ) at the springline of the walls so that they project towards the archway 's center from each supporting side , until the courses meet at the apex of the archway ( often , the last gap is bridged with a flat stone ) . For a corbeled vault covering , the technique is extended in three dimensions along the lengths of two opposing walls .",

It was a fashionable resort for centuries in antiquity , particularly towards the end of the Roman Republic , when it was reckoned as superior to Capri , Pompeii , and Herculaneum by the super-rich , who built luxurious villas here from 100 BC to 500 AD . It was notorious for its hedonistic offerings and the attendant rumours of corruption and scandal . The lower part of the town later became submerged in the sea due to local volcanic , bradyseismic activity which raised or lowered the land , and recent underwater archaeology has revealed many of the fine buildings now protected in the submerged archaeological park .

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) .",

Thermae usually refers to the large imperial bath complexes , while balneae were smaller-scale facilities , public or private , that existed in great numbers throughout Rome . Most Roman cities had at least one - if not many - such buildings , which were centres not only for bathing , but socializing and reading as well . Bath-houses were also provided for wealthy private villas , town houses , and for forts . They were supplied with water from an adjacent river or stream , or within cities by aqueduct . The water would be heated by fire then channelled into the caldarium ( hot bathing room ) . The design of baths is discussed by Vitruvius in De architectura ( V.10 ) .",
  "/wiki/Baths_of_Trajan": "The Baths of Trajan were a massive thermae , a bathing and leisure complex , built in ancient Rome starting from 104 AD and dedicated during the Kalends of July in 109 . Commissioned by Emperor Trajan , the complex of baths occupied space on the southern side of the Oppian Hill on the outskirts of what was then the main developed area of the city , although still inside the boundary of the Servian Wall . The architect of the complex is said to be Apollodorus of Damascus . The baths were being utilized mainly as a recreational and social center by Roman citizens , both men and women , as late as the early 5th century . The complex seems to have been deserted soon afterwards as a cemetery dated to the 5th century ( which remained in use until the 7th century ) has been found in front of the northeastern exedra . The baths were thus no longer in use at the time of the siege of Rome by the Ostrogoths in 537 ; with the destruction of the Roman aqueducts , all thermae were abandoned , as was the whole of the now-waterless Mons Oppius .

It was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated about 126 AD . Its date of construction is uncertain , because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa 's older temple , which had burned down . The building is cylindrical with a portico of large granite Corinthian columns ( eight in the first rank and two groups of four behind ) under a pediment . A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda , which is under a coffered concrete dome , with a central opening ( oculus ) to the sky . Almost two thousand years after it was built , the Pantheon 's dome is still the world 's largest unreinforced concrete dome . The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same , 43 metres ( 142 ft ) . It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings , in large part because it has been in continuous use throughout its history and , since the 7th century , the Pantheon has been in use as a church dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs ( Latin : Sancta Maria ad Martyres ) but informally known as Santa Maria Rotonda . The square in front of the Pantheon is called Piazza della Rotonda . The Pantheon is a state property , managed by Italy 's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism through the Polo Museale del Lazio ; in 2013 it was visited by over 6 million people . The Pantheon 's large circular domed cella , with a conventional temple portico front , was unique in Roman architecture . Nevertheless , it became a standard exemplar when classical styles were revived , and has been copied many times by later architects .",
  "/wiki/Western_world": "The Western world , also known as the West , refers to various regions , nations and states , depending on the context , most often including at least parts of Europe , Australasia , and the Americas . There are many accepted definitions , all closely interrelated . The Western world is also known as the Occident ( from the Latin word occidens , sunset , West ) , in contrast to the Orient ( from the Latin word oriens , rise , East ) , or Eastern world . It might mean the Northern half of the North-South divide . Ancient Greece [ a ] and Ancient Rome [ b ] are generally considered to be the birthplaces of Western civilization - Greece having heavily influenced Rome - the former due to its impact on philosophy , democracy , science , aesthetics and art , building designs and proportions , architecture ; the latter due to its influence on law , warfare , governance , republicanism , engineering and religion . Western civilization is also strongly associated with Christianity , which is in turn shaped by Hellenistic philosophy , Judaism and Roman culture . In the modern era , Western culture has been heavily influenced by the Renaissance , the Ages of Discovery and Enlightenment and the Industrial and Scientific Revolutions . Through extensive imperialism , colonialism and Christianization by Western powers in the 15th to 20th centuries , and later exportation of mass culture , much of the rest of the world has been extensively influenced by Western culture , in a phenomenon often called Westernization . The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the theological , methodological and emphatical division between the Western Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches . West was originally literal , opposing Catholic Europe with the cultures and civilizations of Orthodox Europe , the Middle East and North Africa , Sub-Saharan Africa , South Asia , Southeast Asia and the remote Far East , which early-modern Europeans saw as the East . By the mid-20th century , Western culture was exported worldwide through the emergent mass media : film , radio , television and recorded music ; and the development and growth of international transport and telecommunication ( such as transatlantic cable and the radiotelephone ) played a decisive role in modern globalization . In modern usage , Western world sometimes refers to Europe and to areas whose populations have had a large European ethnical presence since the 15th century Age of Discovery .",

He was also a pioneer of the use of prestressed concrete , patenting the technique of external prestressing ( where the prestressing bars or tendons are not encased in the concrete ) in 1934 . After completing Gymnasium in Karlsruhe , Germany , Dischinger went to the Technical University in Karlsruhe where he studied and received a degree in building engineering . After getting his degree in 1913 , he then started working for Dyckerhoff & Widmann A.G. , an engineering firm in Germany . In 1928 Dischinger went back to school to receive his doctorate at the Technical School in Dresden , Germany . In 1922 , he designed the Zeiss Planetarium in Jena with Walther Bauersfeld , using a thin-shell concrete roof in the shape of a hemisphere . Their system was subsequently patented , and Dischinger published a paper on the relevant mathematics in 1928 . Since the previous stay and cable bridges in Dischinger 's opinion were both flawed technically and disturbing looking , he decided to publish his own cable stayed bridge . This design has been used ever since , more than 100 of these cable stayed bridges have been built . For the 1938 design of a rail suspension bridge ( not built ) , he had studied historical bridges incorporating inclined stay elements , such as those by Ferdinand Arnodin and John Roebling . He went on to design the 183 m span Str\u00f6msund Bridge in Sweden , completed in 1955 and generally considered the first of the modern tradition of cable-stayed bridges , although there had been many isolated examples of the bridge form before then . This employed a steel deck and cables , with large spacings between the stays typical of the early designs .",

One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe , the Vin\u010da culture , evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC . In antiquity , Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and , after 279 BC , Celts settled the city , naming it Singid\u016bn .

It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s , and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire , the Frankish Empire , the Bulgarian Empire , and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284 . In 1521 , Belgrade was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo . It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule , which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars . Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841 .

The country claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo . [ a ] Serbia 's population numbers approximately seven million . Its capital , Belgrade , ranks among the largest citi\u0435s in southeastern Europe . Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age , the territory of modern-day Serbia faced Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe in the 6th century , establishing several regional states in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the Byzantine , Frankish and Hungarian kingdoms . The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s .

  "/wiki/Prestressed_concrete": "Prestressed concrete is a form of concrete used in construction . It is substantially prestressed ( compressed ) during its fabrication , in a manner that strengthens it against tensile forces which will exist when in service . :3-5 This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength tendons located within or adjacent to the concrete and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service . Tendons may consist of single wires , multi-wire strands or threaded bars that are most commonly made from high-tensile steels , carbon fiber or aramid fiber . :52-59 The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied , the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces . This can result in improved structural capacity and/or serviceability compared with conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations . :6 In a prestressed concrete member , the internal stresses are introduced in a planned manner so that the stresses resulting from the superimposed loads are counteracted to the desired degree . Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved performance can allow for longer spans , reduced structural thicknesses , and material savings compared with simple reinforced concrete . Typical applications include high-rise buildings , residential slabs , foundation systems , bridge and dam structures , silos and tanks , industrial pavements and nuclear containment structures . First used in the late-nineteenth century , prestressed concrete has developed beyond pre-tensioning to include post-tensioning , which occurs after the concrete is cast . Tensioning systems may be classed as either monostrand , where each tendon 's strand or wire is stressed individually , or multi-strand , where all strands or wires in a tendon are stressed simultaneously . Tendons may be located either within the concrete volume ( internal prestressing ) or wholly outside of it ( external prestressing ) .",

  "/wiki/Singapore": "Singapore ( /\u02c8s\u026a\u014b ( \u0261 ) \u0259p\u0254\u02d0r/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Singapore , is a sovereign city-state and island country in Southeast Asia . Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 ."
