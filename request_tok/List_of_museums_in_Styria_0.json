  "/wiki/Johannes_Brahms": "Johannes Brahms ( German : [ jo\u02c8han\u0259s \u02c8b\u0281a\u02d0ms ] ; 7 May 1833 - 3 April 1897 ) was a German composer , pianist , and conductor of the Romantic period . Born in Hamburg into a Lutheran family , Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna . His reputation and status as a composer are such that he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the Three Bs of music , a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von B\u00fclow . Brahms composed for symphony orchestra , chamber ensembles , piano , organ , and voice and chorus . A virtuoso pianist , he premiered many of his own works . He worked with some of the leading performers of his time , including the pianist Clara Schumann and the violinist Joseph Joachim ( the three were close friends ) . Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire . An uncompromising perfectionist , Brahms destroyed some of his works and left others unpublished . Brahms has been considered , by his contemporaries and by later writers , as both a traditionalist and an innovator . His music is firmly rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters . While many contemporaries found his music too academic , his contribution and craftsmanship have been admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar . The diligent , highly constructed nature of Brahms 's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers .",

  "/wiki/Neolithic_Age": "The Neolithic ( /\u02ccni\u02d0o\u028a\u02c8l\u026a\u03b8\u026ak/ ( listen ) , also known as the New Stone Age ) , the final division of the Stone Age , began about 12,000 years ago when the first developments of farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic Near East , and later in other parts of the world . The division lasted until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago ( 4500 BC ) , marked by the development of metallurgy , leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age . In Northern Europe , the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC , while in China it extended until 1200 BC . Other parts of the world ( including the New World ) remained broadly in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact . The Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes , including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals . [ a ] The term Neolithic derives from the Greek \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 n\u00e9os , new and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 l\u00edthos , stone , literally meaning New Stone Age .

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",
  "/wiki/Hallstatt_period": "The Hallstatt culture was the predominant Western and Central European culture of Late Bronze Age ( Hallstatt A , Hallstatt B ) from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and Early Iron Age Europe ( Hallstatt C , Hallstatt D ) from the 8th to 6th centuries BC , developing out of the Urnfield culture of the 12th century BC ( Late Bronze Age ) and followed in much of its area by the La T\u00e8ne culture . It is commonly associated with Proto-Celtic and Celtic populations in the Western Hallstatt zone and with ( pre- ) Illyrians in the eastern Hallstatt zone . It is named for its type site , Hallstatt , a lakeside village in the Austrian Salzkammergut southeast of Salzburg , where there was a rich salt mine , and some 1,300 burials are known , many with fine artifacts . Material from Hallstatt has been classified into 4 periods , designated Hallstatt A to D. Hallstatt A and B are regarded as Late Bronze Age and the terms used for wider areas , such as Hallstatt culture , or period , style and so on , relate to the Iron Age Hallstatt C and D. By the 6th century BC , it had expanded to include wide territories , falling into two zones , east and west , between them covering much of western and central Europe down to the Alps , and extending into northern Italy . Parts of Britain and Iberia are included in the ultimate expansion of the culture . The culture was based on farming , but metal-working was considerably advanced , and by the end of the period long-range trade within the area and with Mediterranean cultures was economically significant . Social distinctions became increasingly important , with emerging elite classes of chieftains and warriors , and perhaps those with other skills . Society was organized on a tribal basis , though very little is known about this . Only a few of the largest settlements , like Heuneburg in the south of Germany , were towns rather than villages by modern standards .",
