The party reached the Salmon River valley ( then in Oregon Territory ) on May 27 and selected a permanent site for its mission on June 15 , 1855 . The mission was named Fort Limhi for King Limhi who was one of the kings cited in the Book of Mormon . In Mormon scripture , King Limhi organized an expedition that lasted 22 days , the same duration it required the Mormon missionaries to reach the Salmon River Country . Consequently , they named their mission after King Limhi , and Limhi eventually became Lemhi . The community grew to over 200 people . The settlers brought stock raising and irrigated farming to the region , and dug ditches which are still in use . At least three of the Mormon missionaries at Fort Lemhi married Shoshone women . Due to high prices for cattle to supply the US Army sent to participate in the Utah War and anger at the Mormons aiding their traditional enemies the Nez Perce , the Bannocks under the leadership of Shoo-woo-koo and some Shoshone acting in alliance with them stole the Mormon missionaries ' cattle herd and many of their horses .
