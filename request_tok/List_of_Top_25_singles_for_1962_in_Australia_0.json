  "/wiki/Roy_Orbison": "Roy Kelton Orbison ( April 23 , 1936 - December 6 , 1988 ) was an American singer , songwriter , and musician known for his impassioned singing style , complex song structures , and dark , emotional ballads . Many critics described his music as operatic , nicknaming him the Caruso of Rock and the Big O . While most male rock-and-roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity , many of Orbison 's songs conveyed vulnerability . He performed standing still , wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses . Orbison began singing in a rockabilly and country-and-western band in high school . He was signed by Sam Phillips , of Sun Records , in 1956 , but his greatest success came with Monument Records . From 1960 to 1966 , 22 of his singles reached the Billboard Top 40 , and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10 , including Only the Lonely ( 1960 ) , Running Scared ( 1961 ) , Crying ( 1961 ) , In Dreams ( 1963 ) , and Oh , Pretty Woman ( 1964 ) . Soon afterward , he was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined . In the 1980s , Orbison experienced a resurgence in popularity following the success of several cover versions of his songs . In 1988 , he co-founded the Traveling Wilburys , a rock supergroup , with George Harrison , Bob Dylan , Tom Petty , and Jeff Lynne . Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at the age of 52 . One month later , Orbison 's song You Got It ( 1989 ) , co-written with Lynne and Petty , was released as a solo single and became his first hit to reach the U.S. Top 10 in nearly 25 years .",

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century , he is often referred to as the King of Rock and Roll or simply The King . Presley was born in Tupelo , Mississippi , and relocated to Memphis , Tennessee , with his family when he was 13 years old . His music career began there in 1954 , recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips , who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience . Presley , on rhythm acoustic guitar , and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black , was a pioneer of rockabilly , an uptempo , backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues . In 1955 , drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley 's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker , who would manage him for more than two decades . Presley 's first RCA single , Heartbreak Hotel , was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States . With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records , he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll . His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style , combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations , made him enormously popular - and controversial . In November 1956 , Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender . Drafted into military service in 1958 , Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work . He held few concerts however , and guided by Parker , proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums , most of them critically derided .",
