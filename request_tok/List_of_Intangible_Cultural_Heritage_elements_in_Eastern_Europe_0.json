  "/wiki/Pagan": "Paganism ( from classical Latin p\u0101g\u0101nus rural , rustic , later civilian ) is a term first used in the fourth century by early Christians for people in the Roman Empire who practiced polytheism . This was either because they were increasingly rural and provincial relative to the Christian population , or because they were not milites Christi ( soldiers of Christ ) . Alternate terms in Christian texts for the same group were hellene , gentile , and heathen . Ritual sacrifice was an integral part of ancient Graeco-Roman religion and was regarded as an indication of whether a person was pagan or Christian . Paganism was originally a pejorative and derogatory term for polytheism , implying its inferiority . Paganism has broadly connoted the religion of the peasantry . During and after the Middle Ages , the term paganism was applied to any unfamiliar religion , and the term presumed a belief in false god ( s ) . Most modern pagan religions existing today ( Modern or Neopaganism ) express a world view that is pantheistic , polytheistic or animistic ; but some are monotheistic . The origin of the application of the term pagan to polytheism is debated . In the 19th century , paganism was adopted as a self-descriptor by members of various artistic groups inspired by the ancient world . In the 20th century , it came to be applied as a self-descriptor by practitioners of Modern Paganism , Neopagan movements and Polytheistic reconstructionists . Modern pagan traditions often incorporate beliefs or practices , such as nature worship , that are different from those in the largest world religions .",

  "/wiki/Polyphony": "In music , polyphony is a type of musical texture consisting of two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody , as opposed to a musical texture with just one voice , monophony , or a texture with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords , which is called homophony . Within the context of the Western musical tradition , the term polyphony is usually used to refer to music of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance . Baroque forms such as fugue , which might be called polyphonic , are usually described instead as contrapuntal . Also , as opposed to the species terminology of counterpoint , [ clarification needed ] polyphony was generally either pitch-against-pitch / point-against-point or sustained-pitch in one part with melismas of varying lengths in another . In all cases the conception was probably what Margaret Bent ( 1999 ) calls dyadic counterpoint , with each part being written generally against one other part , with all parts modified if needed in the end . This point-against-point conception is opposed to successive composition , where voices were written in an order with each new voice fitting into the whole so far constructed , which was previously assumed . The term polyphony is also sometimes used more broadly , to describe any musical texture that is not monophonic . Such a perspective considers homophony as a sub-type of polyphony .",

The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

In a broader meaning , Bohemia sometimes refers to the entire Czech territory , including Moravia and Czech Silesia , especially in a historical context , such as the Lands of the Bohemian Crown ruled by Bohemian kings . Bohemia was a duchy of Great Moravia , later an independent principality , a kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire , and subsequently a part of the Habsburg Monarchy and the Austrian Empire . After World War I and the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak state , the total of Bohemia became a part of Czechoslovakia , defying claims of the German speaking inhabitants that regions with German speaking majority should be included in the Republic of German-Austria . Between 1938 and 1945 , these border regions were joined to Nazi Germany as the Sudetenland . The remainder of Czech territory became the Second Czechoslovak Republic and was subsequently occupied as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia . In 1969 , the Czech lands ( including Bohemia ) were given autonomy within Czechoslovakia as the Czech Socialist Republic . In 1990 , the name was changed to the Czech Republic , which became a separate state in 1993 with the breakup of Czechoslovakia . Until 1948 , Bohemia was an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia as one of its lands ( zem\u011b ) . Since then , administrative reforms have replaced self-governing lands with a modified system of regions ( kraje ) which do not follow the borders of the historical Czech lands ( or the regions from the 1960 and 2000 reforms ) . However , the three lands are mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution of the Czech Republic : We , citizens of the Czech Republic in Bohemia , Moravia and Silesia\u2026 Bohemia had an area of 52,065 km2 ( 20,102 sq mi ) and today is home to approximately 6.5 million of the Czech Republic 's 10.5 million inhabitants . Bohemia was bordered in the south by Upper and Lower Austria ( both in Austria ) , in the west by Bavaria and in the north by Saxony and Lusatia ( all in Germany ) , in the northeast by Silesia ( in Poland ) , and in the east by Moravia ( also part of the Czech Republic ) .",
  "/wiki/Lent": "Lent ( Latin : Quadragesima , 'Fortieth ' ) is a solemn religious observance in the Christian liturgical calendar that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends approximately six weeks ( 40 days ) later on Holy Thursday , the memorial of the Lord 's supper the Thursday of Holy Week before Easter Sunday . The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer for Easter through prayer , doing penance , mortifying the flesh , repentance of sins , almsgiving , and denial of ego . This event is observed in the Anglican , Eastern Orthodox , Lutheran , Methodist , Moravian , Oriental Orthodox , Reformed , and Roman Catholic Churches . Some Anabaptist and evangelical churches also observe the Lenten season . The last week of Lent is Holy Week , starting with Palm Sunday . Following the New Testament story , Jesus ' crucifixion is commemorated on Good Friday , and at the beginning of the next week the joyful celebration of Easter Sunday recalls the Resurrection of Jesus Christ . In Lent , many Christians commit to fasting , as well as giving up certain luxuries in order to replicate the account of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ 's journey into the desert for 40 days ; this is known as one 's Lenten sacrifice . Many Christians also add a Lenten spiritual discipline , such as reading a daily devotional or praying through a Lenten calendar , to draw themselves near to God . The Stations of the Cross , a devotional commemoration of Christ 's carrying the Cross and of his execution , are often observed . Many Roman Catholic and some Protestant churches remove flowers from their altars , while crucifixes , religious statues , and other elaborate religious symbols are often veiled in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event . Throughout Christendom , some adherents mark the season with the traditional abstention from the consumption of meat , most notably among Lutherans , Roman Catholics and Anglicans . Lent is traditionally described as lasting for 40 days , in commemoration of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert , according to the Gospels of Matthew , Mark and Luke , before beginning his public ministry , during which he endured temptation by Satan .",

The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope . Its central administration is the Holy See . The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed . The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , [ note 1 ] that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles , and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ . It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith , reserving infallibility , passed down by sacred tradition .

  "/wiki/Carnival": "Carnival is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent . The main events typically occur during February or early March , during the period historically known as Shrovetide ( or Pre-Lent ) . Carnival typically involves public celebrations , including events such as parades , public street parties and other entertainments , combining some elements of a circus . Elaborate costumes and masks allow people to set aside their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity . Participants often indulge in excessive consumption of alcohol , meat , and other foods that will be forgone during upcoming Lent . Traditionally , butter , milk , and other animal products were not consumed excessively , rather , their stock was fully consumed as to reduce waste . Pancakes , donuts , and other desserts were prepared and eaten for a final time . During Lent , animal products are eaten less , and individuals have the ability to make a Lenten sacrifice , thus giving up a certain object or activity of desire . Other common features of Carnival include mock battles such as food fights ; expressions of social satire ; mockery of authorities ; costumes of the grotesque body that display exaggerated features such as large noses , bellies , mouths , phalli , or elements of animal bodies ; abusive language and degrading acts ; depictions of disease and gleeful death ; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms . The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence , as well as in Greece . In historically Evangelical Lutheran countries , the celebration is known as Fastelavn , and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans ( Church of England/US Episcopal Church ) , Methodists , and other Protestants , pre-Lenten celebrations , along with penitential observances , occur on Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras . In Slavic Eastern Orthodox nations , Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent .",

The verbunkos is typically in a pair of sections , slow ( lass\u00fa ) , with a characteristic dotted rhythm , and fast ( friss ) , with virtuosic running-note passages . In some cases , this slow-fast pair alternates at greater length ( Bellman 2001 ) . The name is derived from the German word Werbung , a noun derived from the verb werben that means , in particular , to recruit ; verbunkos - recruiter . This music and dance was played during military recruiting before the Habsburg Emperors , who were also Kings of Hungary , introduced conscription in 1849 . A group of a dozen hussars performed the dance in different parts , with the leading sergeant opening with slow movements , then the lower officers joining for more energetic parts , and the youngest soldiers concluding the dance with jumps and spur-clicking ( Bellman 2001 ) . Despite its name , the melodies originate from Hungarian folk and popular music and have been sometimes attributed to Romani people ( Gypsies ) , because the accompaniment was usually played by Romani musicians in characteristic Romani style ( Bellman 2001 ; Head 2005 , 89 ; Loya 2011 , 17 ) . The Romani composer J\u00e1nos Bihari ( 1764-1827 ) remains the most well-known composer and interpreter of verbunkos . Eighty-four compositions of his remain ( Sisa 1990 , 301 ) . Bihari was an accomplished violinist during his lifetime , and he played in the court in Vienna during the entire Congress of Vienna in 1814 . Another composer of verbunkos was J\u00f3zsef Kossovits ( d. c. 1819 ) . Already with the establishment in 1837 of the Hungarian National Theatre in Pest , the verbunkos style had begun to change under the influence of the first director of the theatre and Hungary 's most important operatic composer , Ferenc Erkel , whose most successful operas were Hunyadi L\u00e1szl\u00f3 ( 1844 ) and B\u00e1nk b\u00e1n ( 1861 ) ( Sisa 1990 , 301 ) .",

Hungarian classical music has long been an experiment , made from Hungarian antedecents and on Hungarian soil , to create a conscious musical culture [ using the ] musical world of the folk song . Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe , leading to an influx of European musical ideas , the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to ( re ) create a Hungarian classical style . For example , B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly , two of Hungary 's most famous composers , are known for using folk themes in their music . Bart\u00f3k collected folk songs from across Central and Eastern Europe , including the Czech Republic , Poland , Romania and Slovakia , whilst Kod\u00e1ly was more interested in creating a distinctively Hungarian musical style . During the era of Communist rule in Hungary ( 1949-1989 ) a Song Committee scoured and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity .

According to the Romanian historian Mircea Eliade , the C\u0103lu\u0219ari were known for their ability to create the impression of flying in the air which he believed represented both the galloping of a horse and the dancing of the fairies ( z\u00eene ) . Indeed , the groups patron was the Queen of the Fairies ( Doamna Z\u00eenelor ) , who was also known as Irodiada and Arada , and who Eliade connected with the folkloric figure Diana . Due to their connection with the fairies , the C\u0103lu\u0219ari were believed to be able to cure the victims of fairies and for around two weeks - from three weeks after Easter till Pentecost - would travel to all the local communities where they would dance , accompanied by a few fiddlers , in order to do so . In their dance , the C\u0103lu\u0219ari carried clubs and a sword , as well as a flag and a wooden horsehead . They swore on the groups flag to treat each other as brothers , to respect the customs of the C\u0103lu\u0219ari and to remain chaste for the next nine days . Upon their return home , their flag was fixed into the ground , with one member climbing it and crying out war , dear ones , war ! . The origins of the C\u0103lu\u0219ari are unknown , although the first written attestations are from the 17th century musical notations of Ioan C\u0103ianu .

Its capital and largest city is Bucharest , and other major urban areas include Cluj-Napoca , Timi\u0219oara , Ia\u0219i , Constan\u021ba , Craiova , Bra\u0219ov , and Gala\u021bi . The River Danube , Europe 's second-longest river , rises in Germany 's Black Forest and flows in a general southeast direction for 2,857 km ( 1,775 mi ) , coursing through ten countries before emptying into Romania 's Danube Delta . The Carpathian Mountains , which cross Romania from the north to the southwest , include Moldoveanu Peak , at an altitude of 2,544 m ( 8,346 ft ) . Modern Romania was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia . The new state , officially named Romania since 1866 , gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877 . Following World War I after declaring its neutrality in 1914 , when Romania fought on the side of the Allied powers starting with 1916 , Bukovina , Bessarabia , Transylvania as well as parts of Banat , Cri\u0219ana , and Maramure\u0219 became part of the sovereign Kingdom of Romania . In June-August 1940 , as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award , Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union , and Northern Transylvania to Hungary . In November 1940 , Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and , consequently , in June 1941 entered World War II on the Axis side , fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944 , when it joined the Allies and recovered Northern Transylvania .",

  "/wiki/Accordion": "Accordions ( from 19th-century German Akkordeon , from Akkord - musical chord , concord of sounds ) are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type , colloquially referred to as a squeezebox . A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist . The concertina and bandone\u00f3n are related ; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family . The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys , causing pallets to open , which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel , called reeds . These vibrate to produce sound inside the body . Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument 's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block . [ notes 1 ] The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand manual , and the accompaniment , consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons , on the left-hand manual . The accordion is widely spread across the world . In some countries ( for example Brazil , Colombia , Dominican Republic , Mexico and Panama ) it is used in popular music ( for example Gaucho , Forr\u00f3 and Sertanejo in Brazil , Vallenato in Colombia , and norte\u00f1o in Mexico ) , whereas in other regions ( such as Europe , North America and other countries in South America ) it tends to be more used for dance-pop and folk music and is often used in folk music in Europe , North America and South America . In Europe and North America , some popular music acts also make use of the instrument . Additionally , the accordion is used in cajun , zydeco , jazz music and in both solo and orchestral performances of classical music . The piano accordion is the official city instrument of San Francisco , California .",
  "/wiki/Violin": "The violin , sometimes known as a fiddle , is a wooden string instrument in the violin family . Most violins have a hollow wooden body . It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use . Smaller violin-type instruments exist , including the violino piccolo and the kit violin , but these are virtually unused . The violin typically has four strings , usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3 , D4 , A4 , E5 , and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings , though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers ( pizzicato ) and by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow ( col legno ) . Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres . They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition , both in ensembles ( from chamber music to orchestras ) and as solo instruments and in many varieties of folk music , including country music , bluegrass music and in jazz . Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion , with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound . Further , the violin has come to be played in many non-Western music cultures , including Indian music and Iranian music . The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it . The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy , with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection . In Europe , it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music , such as the viola .",

Since 15 October 2018 , the ROC is not in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople , having unilaterally severed ties in reaction to the establishment of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine , which was finalised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 5 January 2019 . The Christianization of Kievan Rus ' , widely seen as the birth of the ROC , is believed to have occurred in 988 through the baptism of the Kievan prince Vladimir and his people by the clergy of the Ecumenical Patriarchate , whose constituent part the ROC remained for the next six centuries , while the Kievan see remained in the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate until 1686 . The ROC currently claims its exclusive jurisdiction over the Orthodox Christians , irrespective of their ethnic background , who reside in the former member republics of the Soviet Union , excluding Georgia and Armenia , although this claim is disputed in such countries as Estonia , Moldova and Ukraine and consequently parallel canonical Orthodox jurisdictions exist in those : the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church , the Metropolis of Bessarabia , and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine , respectively . It also exercises ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the autonomous Church of Japan and the Orthodox Christians resident in the People 's Republic of China . The ROC branches in Belarus , Estonia , Latvia , Moldova and Ukraine since the 1990s enjoy various degrees of self-government , albeit short of the status of formal ecclesiastical autonomy . The ROC should not be confused with the Orthodox Church in America ( OCA ) , another autocephalous Orthodox church ( since 1970 , but not universally recognised in this status and viewed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate as a branch of the ROC ) , that traces its existence in North America to the time of the Russian missionaries in Alaska ( then part of the Russian Empire ) in the late 18th century .

They are often set in a dim and nonspecific past that historian of religion Mircea Eliade termed in illo tempore ( 'at that time ' ) . Creation myths address questions deeply meaningful to the society that shares them , revealing their central worldview and the framework for the self-identity of the culture and individual in a universal context .

A tone hole is , in wind instruments [ , ] a hole that may be stopped by the finger , or a key , to change the pitch of the tone produced . The resonant frequencies of the air column in a pipe are inversely proportional to the pipe 's effective length . In other words , a shorter pipe produces higher notes . For a pipe with no tone holes but open at both ends , the effective length is the physical length of the pipe plus a little more for the small volumes of air just beyond the ends of the pipe that are also involved in the resonance . An open hole anywhere along the middle of the pipe shortens the pipe 's effective length and therefore raises the pitch of the notes it produces . The closer an open hole is to the blowing end , the shorter the remaining effective length is and the more it raises the pitch . Generally , a hole in a given position does n't reduce the effective length quite as much as cutting the pipe at that position would , and the smaller the hole , the less it reduces the effective length when open . Closing the hole increases the effective length and lowers the pitch again . However , a pipe with a closed tone hole is not acoustically identical to a pipe with no hole ; the shape of the fingertip or pad that closes the hole modifies the pipe 's internal volume and effective length . When there are multiple tone holes , the first ( closest to the blowing end ) open tone hole usually has the largest influence on the pipe 's effective length .",
  "/wiki/Elder_tree": "Sambucus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Adoxaceae . The various species are commonly called elder or elderberry . The genus was formerly placed in the honeysuckle family , Caprifoliaceae , but was reclassified as Adoxaceae due to genetic and morphological comparisons to plants in the genus Adoxa .",
  "/wiki/Maple_trees": "Acer /\u02c8e\u026as\u0259r/ is a genus of trees and shrubs commonly known as maple . The genus is placed in the family Sapindaceae . There are approximately 128 species , most of which are native to Asia , with a number also appearing in Europe , northern Africa , and North America . Only one species , Acer laurinum , extends to the Southern Hemisphere . The type species of the genus is the sycamore maple , Acer pseudoplatanus , the most common maple species in Europe . The maples have easily recognizable palmate leaves and distinctive winged fruits . The closest relatives of the maples are the horse chestnuts ."
