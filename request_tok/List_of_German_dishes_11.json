  "/wiki/Sauerbraten": "Sauerbraten is a traditional German roast of heavily marinated meat . It is regarded as a national dish of Germany , and is frequently served in German-style restaurants internationally . It can be prepared from a variety of meats , most often from beef , but also from venison , lamb and mutton , pork and horse . Before cooking , the raw meat is marinated for three to ten days in a mixture of vinegar or wine , water , herbs , spices , and seasonings . Usually , tougher cuts of meat such as rump roast or bottom round of beef are used , and the long marinating tenderizes the meat . A Sauerbraten dinner is almost always accompanied by a hearty gravy resulting from its roasting and is most often served with potato pancakes ( Kartoffelpuffer ) , potato dumplings ( Kartoffelkl\u00f6\u00dfe ) , or Sp\u00e4tzle pasta . Ingredients used in the marinade , and accompanyments served with Sauerbraten , vary across regions .

  "/wiki/Potato": "The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas , a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum , and the plant itself , a perennial in the family Solanaceae . Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas , from the United States to southern Chile . The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations , but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes . In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia , from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex , potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000-10,000 years ago . In the Andes region of South America , where the species is indigenous , some close relatives of the potato are cultivated . Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish . Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world 's food supply . As of 2014 , potatoes were the world 's fourth-largest food crop after maize ( corn ) , wheat , and rice . Following millennia of selective breeding , there are now over 1,000 different types of potatoes . Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile , which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andes . The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing . It remains an essential crop in Europe , especially Northern and Eastern Europe , where per capita production is still the highest in the world , while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia , with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2014 .",

  "/wiki/Mussels": "Mussel ( /\u02c8m\u028cs\u0259l/ ) is the common name used for members of several families of bivalve molluscs , from saltwater and freshwater habitats . These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams , which are often more or less rounded or oval . The word mussel is frequently used to mean the bivalves of the marine family Mytilidae , most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal zone , attached by means of their strong byssal threads ( beard ) to a firm substrate . A few species ( in the genus Bathymodiolus ) have colonised hydrothermal vents associated with deep ocean ridges . In most marine mussels the shell is longer than it is wide , being wedge-shaped or asymmetrical . The external colour of the shell is often dark blue , blackish , or brown , while the interior is silvery and somewhat nacreous . The common name mussel is also used for many freshwater bivalves , including the freshwater pearl mussels . Freshwater mussel species inhabit lakes , ponds , rivers , creeks , canals , and they are classified in a different subclass of bivalves , despite some very superficial similarities in appearance . Freshwater zebra mussels and their relatives in the family Dreissenidae are not related to previously mentioned groups , even though they resemble many Mytilus species in shape , and live attached to rocks and other hard surfaces in a similar manner , using a byssus . They are classified with the Heterodonta , the taxonomic group which includes most of the bivalves commonly referred to as clams .",

Korn must contain a minimum of 32% ABV ( 64 proof ) . Above 37.5% ABV ( 75 proof ) it may be named Kornbrand , and the name Doppelkorn , with 38% ABV ( 76 proof ) , has been used in the market .
