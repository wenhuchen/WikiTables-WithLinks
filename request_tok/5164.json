  "/wiki/Call_to_the_Bar": "The call to the bar is a legal term of art in most common law jurisdictions where persons must be qualified to be allowed to argue in court on behalf of another party and are then said to have been called to the bar or to have received a call to the bar . The bar is now used as a collective noun for barristers , but literally referred to the wooden barrier in old courtrooms , which separated the often crowded public area at the rear from the space near the judges reserved for those having business with the Court . Barristers would sit or stand immediately behind it , facing the judge , and could use it as a table for their briefs . Like many other common law terms , the term originated in England in the Middle Ages , and the call to the bar refers to the summons issued to one found fit to speak at the 'bar ' of the royal courts . In time , English judges allowed only legally qualified men to address them on the law and later delegated the qualification and admission of barristers to the four Inns of Court . Once an Inn calls one of its members to its bar , they are thereafter a barrister . They may not , however , practise as a barrister until they have completed ( or been exempted from ) an apprenticeship called pupillage . After completing pupillage , they are considered to be a practising barrister with a right of audience before all courts . England and Wales and some other jurisdictions distinguish two types of lawyers , who are regulated by different bodies , with separate training , examinations , regulation and traditions :",

  "/wiki/Lord_High_Treasurer": "The post of Lord High Treasurer or Lord Treasurer was an English government position and has been a British government position since the Acts of Union of 1707 . A holder of the post would be the third-highest-ranked Great Officer of State , below the Lord High Steward and the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain . The Lord High Treasurer functions as the head of Her Majesty 's Treasury . Since the 18th century , the office has often been held , not by a single person , but placed in commission , so that a board of individuals jointly exercise the powers of the Lord High Treasurer . Such persons are known as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury . The office has been in commission continuously since the resignation of Charles Talbot , 1st Duke of Shrewsbury in 1714 . Although the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was created in 1801 , it was not until the Consolidated Fund Act 1816 that the separate offices of 'Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain ' and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland were united into one office as the 'Lord High Treasurer of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ' on 5 January 1817 . The office continued in commission and the commissioners of the old office of 'Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain ' continued as the commissioners of the new combined office . In modern times , by convention , the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury include the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , usually serving as the 'First Lord of the Treasury ' , and the Chancellor of the Exchequer , serving as the 'Second Lord of the Treasury ' .

Cromwell was one of the strongest and most powerful proponents of the English Reformation . He helped to engineer an annulment of the king 's marriage to Queen Catherine so that Henry could lawfully marry Anne Boleyn . Henry failed to obtain the Pope 's approval for the annulment in 1534 , so Parliament endorsed the king 's claim to be Supreme Head of the Church of England , giving him the authority to annul his own marriage . However , Cromwell subsequently charted an evangelical and reformist course for the Church of England from the unique posts of Vicegerent in Spirituals and vicar-general . :658 , fn . 2 During his rise to power , Cromwell made many enemies , including his former ally Anne Boleyn .

He was senior in rank to the Solicitor-General for Ireland : both advised the Crown on Irish legal matters . With the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 , the duties of the Attorney General and Solicitor General for Ireland were taken over by the Attorney General of Ireland . The office of Solicitor General for Ireland was abolished at the same time , for reasons of economy . This led to repeated complaints from the first Attorney General of Ireland , Hugh Kennedy , about the immense volume of work which he was now forced to deal with single-handed . The first record of the existence of the office of Attorney General in Ireland , some 50 years after the equivalent office was established in England , is in 1313 when Richard Manning was appointed King 's Attorney ( the title Attorney General was not widely used until the 1530s ) . The Attorney General was , initially , junior to the serjeant-at-law , but since the titles King 's Serjeant and King 's Attorney were often used interchangeably , it can be difficult to establish who held which office at any given time . From the early 1660s , due largely to the personal prestige of Sir William Domville , ( AG 1660-1686 ) , the Attorney General became the chief legal adviser to the Crown . In certain periods , notably during the reign of Elizabeth I , who thought poorly of her Irish-born law officers , the English Crown adopted a policy of choosing English lawyers for this office . The Attorney General was always a member of the Privy Council of Ireland , and a strong Attorney , like Philip Tisdall , William Saurin , or Francis Blackburne , could exercise great influence over the Dublin administration . Tisdall ( AG 1760-1777 ) , was for much of his tenure as Attorney General also the Government leader in the Irish House of Commons , and a crucial member of the administration .

His works are credited with developing the scientific method and remained influential through the scientific revolution . Bacon has been called the father of empiricism . His works argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature . Most importantly , he argued science could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves . Although his practical ideas about such a method , the Baconian method , did not have a long-lasting influence , the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method . This method was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science , the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology . Francis Bacon was a patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories - history , poetry , and philosophy - which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings . Bacon was educated at Trinity College , Cambridge , where he rigorously followed the medieval curriculum , largely in Latin . Bacon was the first recipient of the Queen 's counsel designation , which was conferred in 1597 when Elizabeth I of England reserved Bacon as her legal advisor .

  "/wiki/Peterborough_(UK_Parliament_constituency)": "Peterborough is a borough constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Its current form is the direct , unbroken successor of a smaller constituency that was created in the mid-16th century and used for the legislatures of England , Great Britain and the United Kingdom ( UK ) . The seat today elects one Member of Parliament ( MP ) by the first-past-the-post system of election since 1885 , before which its earlier form had two-member representation using the similar bloc vote system and both forms had a broadening but restricted franchise until 1918 .

  "/wiki/William_Bowen_Rowlands": "William Bowen Rowlands ( 1837 - 4 September 1906 ) , was a British politician and Member of Parliament . He was educated at Jesus College , Oxford , matriculating on 22 March 1854 at the age of 18 . He was a scholar from 1855 to 1858 , obtaining his BA degree in 1859 and his MA in 1865 . In 1864 , he was appointed headmaster of a grammar school in Haverfordwest , Pembrokeshire and also curate of Narberth in the same county . He studied law from 1868 at Gray 's Inn , and was called to the Bar in 1871 . He was appointed QC in 1871 and made a Bencher in 1882 . In 1885 he sought the Liberal candidature for the East Glamorganshire constituency and had some influential supporters such as Idris Williams , Porth . However , he lost the nomination to Alfred Thomas . In 1886 , following the decision of David Davies to join the Liberal Unionists , Rowlands was selected as the new Liberal Party candidate for the Cardiganshire constituency . Initially , he was regarded as an outsider due to the network of supporters that the sitting member had in the county , including his influence within the Calvinistic Methodist denomination . However , superior Liberal organization and the support of the majority of nonconformist ministers , who were widely regarded as having influenced the result through their congregations , allowed Rowlands to capture the seat from Davies by a mere nine votes . It may well be that Rowlands , a non-Welsh speaker , did not expect to succeed , and he showed relatively little enthusiasm for his parliamentary responsibilities and seldom visited the county .",
  "/wiki/Ceredigion_(UK_Parliament_constituency)": "Ceredigion , formerly Cardiganshire , is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament . Created in 1536 , the franchise expanded in the late 19th century and on the enfranchisement of women . Its boundaries remained virtually unchanged until 1983 . From 1536 until 1885 the area had two seats ( electing MPs ) : a county constituency ( Cardiganshire ) comprising the rural areas , the other the borough constituency known as the Cardigan District of Boroughs comprising a few separate towns ; in 1885 the latter was abolished , its towns and electors incorporated into the former , reduced to one MP . The towns which comprised the Boroughs varied slightly over this long period , but primarily consisted of Cardigan , Aberystwyth , Lampeter and Adpar , the latter now a suburb of Newcastle Emlyn across the Teifi , in Carmarthenshire . The county constituency ( a distinction from borough class remains , namely as to type of returning officer and permissible electoral expenses ) was merged in 1983 with part of Pembrokeshire , making a new constituency named Ceredigion and Pembroke North . In 1997 it was recreated and its non-Anglicised name became its formal name , Ceredigion . The Ceredigion Welsh Assembly constituency was created with the same boundaries in 1999 .",

  "/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_India": "His ( or Her ) Majesty 's Principal Secretary of State for India , known for short as the India Secretary or the Indian Secretary , was the British Cabinet minister and the political head of the India Office responsible for the governance of the British Indian Empire ( usually known simply as 'the Raj ' or British India ) , Aden , and Burma . The post was created in 1858 when the East India Company 's rule in Bengal ended and India , except for the Princely States , was brought under the direct administration of the government in Whitehall in London , beginning the official colonial period under the British Empire . In 1937 , the India Office was reorganised which separated Burma and Aden under a new Burma Office , but the same Secretary of State headed both Departments and a new title was established as His Majesty 's Principal Secretary of State for India and Burma . The India Office and its Secretary of State were abolished in August 1947 , when the United Kingdom granted independence in the Indian Independence Act , which created two new independent dominions , the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan . Burma soon achieved independence separately in early 1948 ."
