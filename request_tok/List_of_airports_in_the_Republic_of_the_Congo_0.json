Flight information regions are also identified by a unique ICAO-code .",
  "/wiki/IATA_airport_code": "An IATA airport code , also known as an IATA location identifier , IATA station code or simply a location identifier , is a three-letter geocode designating many airports and metropolitan areas around the world , defined by the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) . The characters prominently displayed on baggage tags attached at airport check-in desks are an example of a way these codes are used . The assignment of these codes is governed by IATA Resolution 763 , and it is administered by the IATA 's headquarters in Montreal . The codes are published semi-annually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory . IATA also provides codes for railway stations and for airport handling entities . A list of airports sorted by IATA code is available . A list of railway station codes , shared in agreements between airlines and rail lines such as Amtrak , SNCF French Railways , and Deutsche Bahn , is available . Many railway administrations have their own list of codes for their stations , such as the list of Amtrak station codes .",

Coordinates : 1\u00b038\u2032N 18\u00b004\u2032E / 1.633\u00b0N 18.067\u00b0E / 1.633 ; 18.067Historically called Desbordesville , Impfondo is usually a stopping point on the way to Bangui by barge . It is a frontier kind of place , the last vestige of what could be called civilisation in an area overwhelmed by dense forest swamps and small villages . Rumours abound of a police force and sets of soldiers more corrupt than in other parts of the Congo , probably due to its remoteness , in addition to being so close to the Democratic Republic of Congo over the river . Soldiers from the DR Congo have been known to cross and harass the population on occasion , making people here more on edge than usual . The entire western side of the Congo River in the Likouala is also home to refugee camps , though as conflict in the DR Congo subsides , they should be making their way back across the river . To the west of Impfondo lies the Lac Tele area of tropical jungle . This area is one of the least developed regions of Africa , with stretches of barely touched equatorial rain-forest and wetlands stretching for hundreds of kilometres in every direction . The footprint of civilisation is small , and in some ways threaten to disappear altogether - with barely existent dirt roads connecting small villages with the addition of the looming presence of Ebola epidemics . Wilderness and animal concerns take precedence over the daily lives of people , and by some accounts , the Congo 's north is the 'last great wilderness of Africa ' .",
