It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era . The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch . Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale , which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene , the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage , which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago , and is now included in the Pleistocene . As with other older geologic periods , the geological strata that define the start and end are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain . The boundaries defining the Pliocene are not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer Miocene and the relatively cooler Pliocene . The upper boundary was set at the start of the Pleistocene glaciations .",
  "/wiki/Chait\u00e9n_Volcano": "Chait\u00e9n is a volcanic caldera 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) in diameter , 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) west of the elongated ice-capped Michinmahuida volcano and 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) northeast of the town of Chait\u00e9n , near the Gulf of Corcovado in southern Chile . The most recent eruptive phase of the volcano erupted on 2008 . Originally , radiocarbon dating of older tephra from the volcano suggested that its last previous eruption was in 7420 BC \u00b1 75 years . However , recent studies have found that the volcano is more active than thought . According to the Global Volcanism Program , its last eruption was in 2011 . The caldera rim reaches 1,122 metres ( 3,681 ft ) above sea level . Before the current eruption , it was mostly filled by a rhyolite obsidian lava dome that reached a height of 962 metres ( 3,156 ft ) , partly devoid of vegetation . Two small lakes occupied the caldera floor on the west and north sides of the lava dome . The translucent grey obsidian which had erupted from the volcano was used by pre-Columbian cultures as a raw material for artifacts and has been found as far away as 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) to the south and north , for example in Chan-Chan .",

  "/wiki/Cerro_Porquesa": "Cerro Porquesa is an approximately 4,600 metres ( 15,100 ft ) high ( 800 metres ( 2,600 ft ) above base ) rhyodacite lava dome in the Andes . The lava dome is of Pliocene/Pleistocene age with little glacial features on the younger domes indicating young ages . The dome was formed in at least three different eruption stages , with each stage contributing about two or three different lobes . Further , a rhyolitic ignimbrite with 69.5% SiO2 may be linked to the domes . It fills a valley in the south of the complex about 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) thick . This ignimbrite is dated 0.73\u00b10.16 and 0.63 +0.92/-0.63 mya by potassium-argon dating in biotite , although with low precision . This lava dome is located 20\u00b0 in a volcanic gap named Pica gap . In this gap volcanic activity younger than 2 mya is n't found and where lead ( Pb ) isotope ratios in rocks change with the radiogenicity of the isotope ratio decreasing northward . Porquesa has intermediary isotope ratios . The lower ratio was principally imparted by the low-radiogenic Pb upper crust . Samples and the appearance of the domes in aerial photographs indicate a homogeneous composition with about 68% SiO2 .",

In volcanology this group is known as the Puyehue-Cord\u00f3n Caulle Volcanic Complex ( PCCVC ) . Four volcanoes constitute the volcanic group or complex , the Cordillera Nevada caldera , the Pliocene Mencheca volcano , Cord\u00f3n Caulle fissure vents and the Puyehue stratovolcano . Like most stratovolcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt , Puyehue and Cord\u00f3n Caulle are along the intersection of a traverse fracture with the larger north-south Liqui\u00f1e-Ofqui Fault . The volcanic complex has shaped the local landscape and produced a huge variety of volcanic landforms and products over the last 300,000 years . Cinder cones , lava domes , calderas and craters can be found in the area apart from the widest variety of volcanic rocks in all the Southern Zone , for example both primitive basalts and rhyolites . Cord\u00f3n Caulle erupted shortly after the 1960 Valdivia earthquake , the largest recorded earthquake in history . Apart from this , the Puyehue-Cord\u00f3n Caulle area is one of the main sites of exploration for geothermal power in Chile . Geothermal activity is manifested on the surface of Puyehue and Cord\u00f3n Caulle as several boiling springs , solfataras and fumaroles . Most of the stone artifacts found in Pilauco Bajo ( dated to c. 12.5 to 13.5 ka BP ) are made of dacite , rhyodacite and rhyolite from the Puyehue-Cord\u00f3n Caulle .

It began approximately 11,650 cal years before present , after the last glacial period , which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat . The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene together form the Quaternary period . The Holocene has been identified with the current warm period , known as MIS 1 . It is considered by some to be an interglacial period within the Pleistocene Epoch , called the Flandrian interglacial . The Holocene corresponds with rapid proliferation , growth and impacts of the human species worldwide , including all of its written history , technological revolutions , development of major civilizations , and overall significant transition towards urban living in the present . Human impacts on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for future evolution of living species , including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence , or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of human impacts . In July 2018 , the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene epoch into three distinct subsections , Greenlandian ( 11,700 years ago to 8,326 years ago ) , Northgrippian ( 8,326 years ago to 4,200 years ago ) and Meghalayan ( 4,200 years ago to the present ) , as proposed by International Commission on Stratigraphy .

  "/wiki/Lascar_Volcano": "Lascar is a stratovolcano within the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , a volcanic arc that spans the countries of Peru , Bolivia , Argentina and Chile . It is the most active volcano in the region , with records of eruptions going back to 1848 . It is composed of two separate cones with several summit craters . The westernmost crater of the eastern cone is presently active . Volcanic activity is characterized by constant release of volcanic gas and occasional vulcanian eruptions . Lascar has been active since at least 56,000 years ago , though some argue for activity beginning 220,000 years ago . The first known activity occurred at the eastern cone and was characterized by lava flows , before shifting to the western cone where lava domes were emplaced . An eruption event known as Piedras Grandes was followed by the large Soncor eruption . A new western edifice was constructed on top of the Soncor vent , during the Holocene activity then shifted again to the eastern edifice and continues there to this day . The magma supplied to the volcano ultimately comes from the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate . A number of other volcanoes are found in the region , such as Aguas Calientes , Cordon de Puntas Negras and the giant La Pacana caldera . The volcano experienced at least three major eruptions throughout its history : One is the Soncor eruption about 26,450 \u00b1 500 years ago , another in 7,250 BCE and the third in 1993 .",

It is part of the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes , one of the four volcanic belts in the Andes chain . The volcano has evolved in close contact with glacial ice . It differs from many calderas in that Sollipulli appears to have collapsed in a non-explosive manner . The age of collapse is not yet known , but it is presently filled with ice to thicknesses of 650 m ( 2,130 ft ) . The ice drains through two glaciers in the west and the north of the caldera . Sollipulli has developed on a basement formed by Mesozoic and Cenozoic geological formations . Sollipulli was active in the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs . A large Plinian eruption occurred 2,960-2,780 years before present , forming the Alpehu\u00e9 crater and generating a high eruption column and ignimbrite deposits .

  "/wiki/Taapaca": "Taapaca is a Holocene volcanic complex in northern Chile 's Arica y Parinacota Region . Located in the Chilean Andes , it is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt , one of four distinct volcanic chains in South America . The town of Putre lies at the southwestern foot of the volcano . Like other volcanoes of the Central Volcanic Zone , Taapaca formed from the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate . It lies on the western margin of the Altiplano high plateau , on top of older volcanic and sedimentary units . Taapaca has mainly erupted dacite , in the form of numerous lava domes , although an andesitic stratovolcano is also present . Volcanic activity at Taapaca occurred in several stages starting during the Plio-Pleistocene . The emplacement of lava domes was often followed by their collapse and the formation of block-and-ash avalanches , and parts of the volcano underwent sector collapses ( large landslides ) . It was at first assumed that activity ended during the Pleistocene , but late eruptions occurred until 2,300 years ago ; the latest is dated to 320 BCE . The Chilean Geological Service monitors the volcano as it is a hazard to Putre , but eruptions could also impact local roads and areas as far east as Bolivia ."
