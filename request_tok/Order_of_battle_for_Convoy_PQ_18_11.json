  "/wiki/German_cruiser_Admiral_Scheer": "Admiral Scheer was a Deutschland-class heavy cruiser ( often termed a pocket battleship ) which served with the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany during World War II . The vessel was named after Admiral Reinhard Scheer , German commander in the Battle of Jutland . She was laid down at the Reichsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven in June 1931 and completed by November 1934 . Originally classified as an armored ship ( Panzerschiff ) by the Reichsmarine , in February 1940 the Germans reclassified the remaining two ships of this class as heavy cruisers . [ a ] The ship was nominally under the 10,000 long tons ( 10,000 t ) limitation on warship size imposed by the Treaty of Versailles , though with a full load displacement of 15,180 long tons ( 15,420 t ) , she significantly exceeded it . Armed with six 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns in two triple gun turrets , Admiral Scheer and her sisters were designed to outgun any cruiser fast enough to catch them . Their top speed of 28 knots ( 52 km/h ; 32 mph ) left only a handful of ships in the Anglo-French navies able to catch them and powerful enough to sink them . Admiral Scheer saw heavy service with the German Navy , including a deployment to Spain during the Spanish Civil War , where she bombarded the port of Almer\u00eda . Her first operation during World War II was a commerce raiding operation into the southern Atlantic Ocean ; she also made a brief foray into the Indian Ocean . During the operation , she sank 113,223 gross register tons ( GRT ) of shipping , making her the most successful capital ship surface raider of the war . Following her return to Germany , she was deployed to northern Norway to interdict shipping to the Soviet Union . She was part of the abortive attack on Convoy PQ 17 and conducted Operation Wunderland , a sortie into the Kara Sea .",
  "/wiki/Deutschland-class_cruiser": "The Deutschland class was a series of three Panzerschiffe ( armored ships ) , a form of heavily armed cruiser , built by the Reichsmarine officially in accordance with restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles . The ships of the class , Deutschland , Admiral Scheer and Admiral Graf Spee , were all stated to displace 10,000 long tons ( 10,000 t ) in accordance with the Treaty , though they actually displaced 10,600 to 12,340 long tons ( 10,770 to 12,540 t ) at standard displacement . Despite violating the weight limit , the design for the ships incorporated several radical innovations to save weight . They were the first major warships to use welding and all-diesel propulsion . Due to their heavy armament of six 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns and lighter weight , the British began referring to the vessels as pocket battleships . The Deutschland-class ships were initially classified as Panzerschiffe but the Kriegsmarine reclassified them as heavy cruisers in February 1940 . The three ships were built between 1929 and 1936 by the Deutsche Werke in Kiel and the Reichsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven , seeing much service with the German Navy . All three vessels served on non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War . While on patrol , Deutschland was attacked by Republican bombers , and in response , Admiral Scheer bombarded the port of Almer\u00eda . In 1937 , Admiral Graf Spee represented Germany at the Coronation Review for Britain 's King George VI . For the rest of their peacetime careers , the ships conducted a series of fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic and visited numerous foreign ports in goodwill tours . Before the outbreak of World War II , Deutschland and Admiral Graf Spee were deployed to the Atlantic to put them in position to attack Allied merchant traffic once war was declared .",
  "/wiki/Kriegsmarine": "The Kriegsmarine ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8k\u0281i\u02d0ksma\u02cc\u0281i\u02d0n\u0259 ] , lit . War Navy ) was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945 . It superseded the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) and the inter-war Reichsmarine ( 1919-1935 ) of the Weimar Republic . The Kriegsmarine was one of three official branches , along with the Heer and the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht , the German armed forces from 1933 to 1945 . In violation of the Treaty of Versailles , the Kriegsmarine grew rapidly during German naval rearmament in the 1930s . The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of submarines . Kriegsmarine ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the Spanish Civil War ( 1936-1939 ) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention , but in reality supported the Nationalists against the Spanish Republicans . In January 1939 , Plan Z was ordered , calling for surface naval parity with the British Royal Navy by 1944 . When World War II broke out in September 1939 , Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building program for submarines ( U-boats ) instead of capital surface warships and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources . The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine ( as for all branches of armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power ) was Adolf Hitler , who exercised his authority through the Oberkommando der Marine . The Kriegsmarine 's most significant ships were the U-boats , most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II . Wolfpacks were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic but this tactic was largely abandoned by May 1943 when U-boat losses mounted .",
  "/wiki/German_cruiser_Admiral_Hipper": "Admiral Hipper , the first of five ships of her class , was the lead ship of the Admiral Hipper class of heavy cruisers which served with Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine during World War II . The ship was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in July 1935 and launched February 1937 ; Admiral Hipper entered service shortly before the outbreak of war , in April 1939 . The ship was named after Admiral Franz von Hipper , commander of the German battlecruiser squadron during the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and later commander-in-chief of the German High Seas Fleet . She was armed with a main battery of eight 20.3 cm ( 8.0 in ) guns and , although nominally under the 10,000-long-ton ( 10,000 t ) limit set by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement , actually displaced over 16,000 long tons ( 16,000 t ) . Admiral Hipper saw a significant amount of action during the war , notably present during the Battle of the Atlantic . She led the assault on Trondheim during Operation Weser\u00fcbung ; while en route to her objective , she sank the British destroyer HMS Glowworm . In December 1940 , she broke out into the Atlantic Ocean to operate against Allied merchant shipping , though this operation ended without significant success . In February 1941 , Admiral Hipper sortied again , sinking several merchant vessels before eventually returning to Germany via the Denmark Strait . The ship was then transferred to northern Norway to participate in operations against convoys to the Soviet Union , culminating in the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942 , where she sank the destroyer Achates and the minesweeper Bramble but was in turn damaged and forced to withdraw by the light cruisers HMS Sheffield and HMS Jamaica . Disappointed by the failure to sink merchant ships in that battle , Adolf Hitler ordered the majority of the surface warships scrapped , though Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz was able to persuade Hitler to retain the surface fleet . As a result , Admiral Hipper was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs . The ship was never restored to operational status , however , and on 3 May 1945 , Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged her while she was in Kiel .",
  "/wiki/Admiral_Hipper-class_cruiser": "The Admiral Hipper class was a group of five heavy cruisers built by Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine beginning in the mid-1930s . The class comprised Admiral Hipper , the lead ship , Bl\u00fccher , Prinz Eugen , Seydlitz , and L\u00fctzow . Only the first three ships of the class saw action with the German Navy during World War II . Work on Seydlitz stopped when she was approximately 95 percent complete ; it was decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier , but this was not completed either . L\u00fctzow was sold incomplete to the Soviet Union in 1940 . Admiral Hipper and Bl\u00fccher took part in Operation Weser\u00fcbung , the invasion of Norway in April 1940 . Bl\u00fccher was sunk by Norwegian coastal defenses outside Oslo while Admiral Hipper led the attack on Trondheim . She then conducted sorties into the Atlantic to attack Allied merchant shipping . In 1942 , she was deployed to northern Norway to attack shipping to the Soviet Union , culminating in the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 , where she was damaged by British cruisers . Prinz Eugen saw her first action during Operation Rhein\u00fcbung with the battleship Bismarck . She eventually returned to Germany during the Channel Dash in 1942 , after which she too went to Norway . After being torpedoed by a British submarine , she returned to Germany for repairs .",
  "/wiki/German_cruiser_K\u00f6ln": "K\u00f6ln was a light cruiser , the third member of the K\u00f6nigsberg class that was operated between 1929 and March 1945 , including service in World War II . She was operated by two German navies , the Reichsmarine and the Kriegsmarine . She had two sister ships , K\u00f6nigsberg and Karlsruhe . K\u00f6ln was built by the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel ; she was laid down in August 1926 , launched in May 1928 , and commissioned into the Reichsmarine in 15 January 1930 . She was armed with a main battery of nine 15 cm SK C/25 guns in three triple turrets and had a top speed of 32 knots ( 59 km/h ; 37 mph ) . Like her sister ships , K\u00f6ln served as a training ship for naval cadets in the 1930s , and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War during the latter part of the decade . After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , she conducted several operations in the North Sea , but did not encounter any British warships . She participated in the attack on Bergen during Operation Weser\u00fcbung in April 1940 , and she was the only member of her class to survive the operation . In 1942 , she was modified to carry a Flettner Fl 282 helicopter experimentally . Later in 1942 , she returned to Norway , but did not see significant action . She remained there until early 1945 , when she returned to Germany ; in March , she was sunk by American bombers in Wilhelmshaven . She remained on an even keel , with her gun turrets above water ; this allowed her to provide gunfire support to defenders of the city until the end of the war in May 1945 .",
  "/wiki/K\u00f6nigsberg-class_cruiser_(1927)": "The K\u00f6nigsberg class , sometimes referred to as the K class , was a class of light cruisers of the German Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine . The class comprised three ships named after German cities : K\u00f6nigsberg , Karlsruhe , and K\u00f6ln , all built between 1926 and 1930 . These ships were the first of the Reichsmarine with a modern cruiser design ; their predecessor , Emden , was based on World War I-era designs . They were armed with a main battery of nine 15 cm ( 5.9 in ) guns and with twelve 50 cm ( 20 in ) torpedo tubes . All three ships of the class were used extensively as training cruisers throughout the 1930s . They went on numerous overseas cruises and participated in the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 1936-1939 . After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , the three ships laid defensive minefields in the North Sea . They all saw action in Operation Weser\u00fcbung , the invasion of Norway , in April 1940 ; K\u00f6nigsberg was damaged by Norwegian coastal guns outside Bergen and sunk by British bombers the following day . Karlsruhe was sunk by the British submarine HMS Truant ; only K\u00f6ln survived the attack on Norway . After returning to Germany , K\u00f6ln operated Flettner Fl 282 helicopters as an experiment . She provided gunfire support to German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa , the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 , and returned to Norway in 1942 . Ultimately , she was sunk in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945 by American bombers .",
  "/wiki/German_destroyer_Z4_Richard_Beitzen": "The German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen was one of four Type 1934 destroyers built for the German Navy ( Kriegsmarine ) during the mid-1930s . Completed in 1937 , the ship spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939 . At the beginning of World War II in September 1939 , the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast , but was soon transferred to the Kattegat where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods . In late 1939 and early 1940 , the ship laid two offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed 17 merchant ships . Z4 Richard Beitzen was in reserve during the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year , where she made several attacks on British shipping . The ship returned to Germany in early 1941 for a refit and was transferred to Norway in June as part of the preparations for Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union . Z4 Richard Beitzen spent some time at the beginning of the campaign conducting anti-shipping patrols in Soviet waters but these were generally fruitless . She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year . The ship was briefly transferred to France in early 1942 in preparation for the Channel Dash where she was one of the escorts for two battleships and a heavy cruiser as they sailed from Brest , France , through the English Channel , to Germany , before returning to Norway . Z4 Richard Beitzen escorted several heavy cruisers at the beginning and end of their anti-shipping raids in 1942 . She participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea when Convoy JW 51B was attacked on 31 December 1942 near the North Cape , Norway . Z4 Richard Beitzen spent much of 1943 escorting ships to and from Norway until she ran aground in November .",
  "/wiki/German_World_War_II_destroyers": "At the outbreak of the Second World War Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine had 21 destroyers ( Ger : Zerst\u00f6rer ) in service , while another one was just being completed . These 22 vessels - comprising 3 classes ( Type 34 , 34A and 36 ) - had all been built in the 1930s , making them modern vessels ( no destroyers remained in German hands following the close of the First World War ) . [ note 1 ] Including that final pre-war vessel , a further 19 were brought into service during the war and more were captured from opposing navies , including the Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) after the Italian Armistice with the Allies in 1943 . German destroyer classes were generally known by the year of their design . Because of their size , use and weaponry , some vessels classified as fleet torpedo boats , Flottentorpedoboot , are also described . During World War II , destroyers were administratively grouped into one of several destroyer flotillas . Class general characteristics are taken from the first of each class , and may differ slightly for individual ships , particularly when they were refitted . Post-war , some surviving ships had significant changes to armament .",
  "/wiki/German_destroyer_Z23": "Z23 was one of fifteen Type 1936A destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine ( German Navy ) during World War II . Completed in 1940 , the ship spent the war in Norwegian and French waters , escorting German ships and occasionally engaging Allied warships . In early 1941 she escorted ships between the Baltic and southern Norway before spending four months protecting ships as they transited through the Bay of Biscay . A few months after the Operation Barbarossa began in June , Z23 was transferred to northern Norway where she attempted to intercept one of the Arctic convoys returning from the Soviet Union and helped to lay several minefield . Transferred to back to France in early 1943 where she resumed her former role of escorting ships through the Bay of Biscay , which were threatened by Allied aircraft and cruisers attempting to prevent Axis blockade runners from reaching port through the bay . One such mission resulted in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay at the end of the year , in which Z23 played a minor role . On 12 August , she was bombed by British heavy bombers and was declared a constructive total loss . The French salvaged her after the war and used her as a source of spare parts for the ex-German destroyers that they had in service . The ship was condemned in 1951 and later broken up .",
