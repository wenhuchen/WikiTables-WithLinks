  "/wiki/Pharaoh": "Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty ( c. 3150 BCE ) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE , although the actual term Pharaoh was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until Merneptah , c. 1200 BCE . In the early dynasty , ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to three titles , the Horus , the Sedge and Bee ( nswt-bjtj ) name , and the Two Ladies ( nbtj ) name . The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added . In Egyptian society , religion was central to everyday life . One of the roles of the pharaoh was as an intermediary between the gods and the people . The pharaoh thus deputised for the gods ; his role was both as civil and religious administrator . He owned all of the land in Egypt , enacted laws , collected taxes , and defended Egypt from invaders as the commander-in-chief of the army . Religiously , the pharaoh officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples . He was responsible for maintaining Maat ( m\ua723\ua725t ) , or cosmic order , balance , and justice , and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat , such as to obtain resources . During the early days prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt , the Deshret or the Red Crown , was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt , while the Hedjet , the White Crown , was worn by the kings of the kingdom of Upper Egypt . After the unification of both kingdoms into one united Egypt , the Pschent , the combination of both the red and white crowns was the official crown of kings . With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties like the Khat , Nemes , Atef , Hemhem crown , and Khepresh .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_Egypt": "Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa , concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River , situated in the place that is now the country Egypt . Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC ( according to conventional Egyptian chronology ) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes ( often identified with Narmer ) . The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms , separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods : the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age , the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age . Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom , ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Near East , after which it entered a period of slow decline . During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers , including the Hyksos , the Libyans , the Nubians , the Assyrians , the Achaemenid Persians , and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great . The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom , formed in the aftermath of Alexander 's death , ruled Egypt until 30 BC , when , under Cleopatra , it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province . The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture . The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops , which supported a more dense population , and social development and culture . With resources to spare , the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions , the early development of an independent writing system , the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects , trade with surrounding regions , and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance . Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes , religious leaders , and administrators under the control of a pharaoh , who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs . The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying , surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids , temples , and obelisks ; a system of mathematics , a practical and effective system of medicine , irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques , the first known planked boats , Egyptian faience and glass technology , new forms of literature , and the earliest known peace treaty , made with the Hittites . Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy .",
  "/wiki/Horus": "Horus or Her , Heru , Hor in Ancient Egyptian , is one of the most significant ancient Egyptian deities who served many functions , most notably god of kingship and the sky . He was worshipped from at least the late prehistoric Egypt until the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt . Different forms of Horus are recorded in history and these are treated as distinct gods by Egyptologists . These various forms may possibly be different manifestations of the same multi-layered deity in which certain attributes or syncretic relationships are emphasized , not necessarily in opposition but complementary to one another , consistent with how the Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality . He was most often depicted as a falcon , most likely a lanner falcon or peregrine falcon , or as a man with a falcon head . The earliest recorded form of Horus is the tutelary deity of Nekhen in Upper Egypt , who is the first known national god , specifically related to the ruling pharaoh who in time came to be regarded as a manifestation of Horus in life and Osiris in death . The most commonly encountered family relationship describes Horus as the son of Isis and Osiris , and he plays a key role in the Osiris myth as Osiris 's heir and the rival to Set , the murderer and brother of Osiris . In another tradition Hathor is regarded as his mother and sometimes as his wife .",

It became part of the city that the Egyptians named Per-Wadjet House of Wadjet and the Greeks called Buto ( now Desouk ) , which was an important site in prehistoric Egypt and the cultural developments of the Paleolithic . Wadjet was said to be the patron and protector of Lower Egypt , and upon unification with Upper Egypt , the joint protector and patron of all of Egypt . The image of Wadjet with the sun disk is called the uraeus , and it was the emblem on the crown of the rulers of Lower Egypt . She was also the protector of kings and of women in childbirth . Wadjet was said to be the nurse of the infant god Horus . With the help of his mother Isis , they protected Horus from his treacherous uncle , Set , when they took refuge in the swamps of the Nile Delta . Wadjet was closely associated in ancient Egyptian religion with the Eye of Ra , a powerful protective deity . The hieroglyph for her eye is shown below ; sometimes two are shown in the sky of religious images . Per-Wadjet also contained a sanctuary of Horus , the child of the sun deity who would be interpreted to represent the pharaoh . Much later , Wadjet became associated with Isis as well as with many other deities . In the relief shown to the right , which is on the wall of the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Luxor , there are two images of Wadjet : one of her as the uraeus with her head through an ankh and another where she precedes a Horus hawk wearing the Pschent , representing the pharaoh whom she protects .",

  "/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan": "The Emperor of Japan is the head of the Imperial Family and the head of state of Japan . Under the 1947 constitution , he is defined as the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people . Historically , he is also the highest authority of the Shinto religion . In Japanese , the Emperor is called Tenn\u014d ( \u5929\u7687 , pronounced [ tenno\ua71c\u02d0 ] ) , literally heavenly sovereign . In English , the use of the term Mikado ( \u5e1d\uff0f\u5fa1\u9580 ) for the Emperor was once common , but is now considered obsolete . Currently , the Emperor of Japan is the only head of state in the world with the English title of emperor . The Imperial House of Japan is the oldest continuing monarchical house in the world . The historical origins of the emperors lie in the late Kofun period of the 3rd-6th centuries AD , but according to the traditional account of the Kojiki ( finished 712 ) and Nihon Shoki ( finished 720 ) , Japan was founded in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu , who was said to be a direct descendant of the sun-goddess Amaterasu . Naruhito is the current Emperor of Japan . He acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne upon the abdication of his father , the now-Emperor Emeritus Akihito on 1 May 2019 at midnight JST . The role of the Emperor of Japan has historically alternated between a largely ceremonial symbolic role and that of an actual imperial ruler . Since the establishment of the first shogunate in 1199 , the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander , unlike many Western monarchs .",
  "/wiki/Shinto": "Shinto , [ a ] also known as Shintoism or kami-no-michi , [ b ] is a religion originating from Japan . Classified as an East Asian religion by scholars of religion , its practitioners often regard it as Japan 's indigenous religion . Scholars sometimes call its practitioners Shintoists , although adherents rarely use that term themselves . Shinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami ( gods or spirits ) , supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things . The link between the kami and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered animistic and pantheistic . The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines , family shrines , and public shrines . The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion 's adherents . Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances , age specific celebrations , and seasonal festivals . These festivals and rituals are collectively called matsuri . A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing . Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity , reverence for kami , and regular communion following seasonal practices . Shinto has no single creator or specific doctrinal text , but exists in a diverse range of localized and regionalised forms .",

During the pre-1945 period , Japan moved into political totalitarianism , ultranationalism and fascism culminating in Japan 's invasion of China in 1937 . This was part of a global period of social upheavals and conflicts such as the Great Depression and World War II . Defeat in the Second World War brought about radical change in Japan . For the first and only time in its history , Japan was occupied by foreign powers ; this occupation lasted seven years . Allied occupation brought forth sweeping democratic reforms . It led to the formal end of the emperor 's status as a demigod and the transformation of Japan from a form of mixed constitutional and absolute monarchy to a Constitutional monarchy with a liberal democracy . In 1952 , with the Treaty of San Francisco , Japan became a sovereign nation again . The post-war Sh\u014dwa period is characterized by the Japanese economic miracle .

Named for its heartland in Qin state ( modern Gansu and Shaanxi ) , the dynasty was founded by Qin Shi Huang , the First Emperor of Qin . The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC , during the Warring States period . In the mid and late third century BC , the Qin state carried out a series of swift conquests , first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty , and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States . Its 15 years was the shortest major dynasty in Chinese history , consisting of only two emperors , but inaugurated an imperial system that lasted from 221 BC , with interruption and adaptation , until 1912 AD . The Qin sought to create a state unified by structured centralized political power and a large military supported by a stable economy . The central government moved to undercut aristocrats and landowners to gain direct administrative control over the peasantry , who comprised the overwhelming majority of the population and labour force . This allowed ambitious projects involving three hundred thousand peasants and convicts , such as connecting walls along the northern border , eventually developing into the Great Wall of China . The Qin introduced a range of reforms such as standardized currency , weights , measures , and a uniform system of writing , which aimed to unify the state and promote commerce . Additionally , its military used the most recent weaponry , transportation , and tactics , though the government was heavy-handedly bureaucratic . Han Confucians portrayed the legalistic Qin dynasty as a monolithic tyranny , notably citing a purge known as the burning of books and burying of scholars although some modern scholars dispute the veracity of these accounts . When the first emperor died in 210 BC , two of his advisers placed an heir on the throne in an attempt to influence and control the administration of the dynasty .",

He was born Ying Zheng ( \u5b34\u653f ) or Zhao Zheng ( \u8d99\u653f ) , a prince of the state of Qin . He became Zheng , the King of Qin ( \u79e6\u738b\u653f ) when he was thirteen , then China 's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had conquered all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC .

His self-invented title emperor ( \u7687\u5e1d hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec ) , as indicated by his use of the word First , would continue to be borne by Chinese rulers for the next two millennia .

Qin Shi Huang also worked with his minister Li Si to enact major economic and political reforms aimed at the standardization of the diverse practices of the earlier Chinese states . He is traditionally said to have banned and burned many books and executed scholars , though a closer examination renders the account doubtful . His public works projects included the unification of diverse state walls into a single Great Wall of China and a massive new national road system , as well as the city-sized mausoleum guarded by the life-sized Terracotta Army . He ruled until his death in 210 BC during his fourth tour of Eastern China .",
  "/wiki/Roman_emperor": "The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period ( starting in 27 BC ) . The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history . Often when a given Roman is described as becoming emperor in English , it reflects his taking of the title Augustus or Caesar . Another title often used was imperator , originally a military honorific . Early Emperors also used the title Princeps Civitatis ( 'first citizen ' ) . Emperors frequently amassed republican titles , notably princeps senatus , consul and pontifex maximus . The legitimacy of an emperor 's rule depended on his control of the army and recognition by the Senate ; an emperor would normally be proclaimed by his troops , or invested with imperial titles by the Senate , or both . The first emperors reigned alone ; later emperors would sometimes rule with co-emperors and divide administration of the empire between them . The Romans considered the office of emperor to be distinct from that of a king . The first emperor , Augustus , resolutely refused recognition as a monarch . Although Augustus could claim that his power was authentically republican , his successors , Tiberius and Nero , could not convincingly make the same claim . Nonetheless , for the first three hundred years of Roman emperors , from Augustus until Diocletian , efforts were made to portray the emperors as leaders of a republic .",

He was also a historian and wrote Latin prose . In 60 BC , Caesar , Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate , a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years . Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate , among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero . Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a number of his accomplishments , notably his victories in the Gallic Wars , completed by 51 BC . During this time , Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the English Channel and the Rhine River , when he built a bridge across the Rhine and crossed the Channel to invade Britain . Caesar 's wars extended Rome 's territory to Britain and past Gaul . These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey , who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC . With the Gallic Wars concluded , the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome . Leaving his command in Gaul meant losing his immunity from being charged as a criminal for waging unsanctioned wars . As a result , Caesar found himself with no other options but to cross the Rubicon with the 13th Legion in 49 BC , leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms . This began Caesar 's civil war , and his victory in the war by 45 BC put him in an unrivaled position of power and influence .",

[ nb 2 ] His status as the founder of the Roman Principate has consolidated an enduring legacy as one of the most effective and controversial leaders in human history . The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana . The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries , despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire 's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors over the imperial succession . Augustus was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia . His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC , and Octavius was named in Caesar 's will as his adopted son and heir . Along with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus , he formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar . Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi , the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as de facto dictators . The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members . Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position , and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC .

He succeeded his stepfather , Augustus . Born to Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla in a Claudian family , he was given the personal name Tiberius Claudius Nero . His mother divorced Nero and married Octavian - later to ascend to Emperor as Augustus - who officially became his stepfather . Tiberius would later marry Augustus ' daughter ( from his marriage to Scribonia ) , Julia the Elder , and even later be adopted by Augustus . Through the adoption , he officially became a Julian , assuming the name Tiberius Julius Caesar . The emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years ; historians have named it the Julio-Claudian dynasty . His relationship to the other emperors of this dynasty was as follows : he was the stepson of Augustus , grand-uncle of Caligula , paternal uncle of Claudius , and great-grand uncle of Nero . Tiberius ' 22-and-a-half-year reign would be the longest after that of Augustus until that of Antoninus Pius , who surpassed his reign by a few months . Tiberius was one of the greatest Roman generals ; his conquest of Pannonia , Dalmatia , Raetia , and ( temporarily ) parts of Germania , laid the foundations for the northern frontier . Even so , he came to be remembered as a dark , reclusive and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor ; Pliny the Elder called him the gloomiest of men .

The son of the popular Roman general Germanicus and Augustus 's granddaughter Agrippina the Elder , Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire , conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty . Germanicus ' uncle and adoptive father , Tiberius , succeeded Augustus as emperor of Rome in 14 AD . Although he was born Gaius Caesar , after Julius Caesar , he acquired the nickname Caligula ( meaning little [ soldier 's ] boot , the diminutive form of caliga ) from his father 's soldiers during their campaign in Germania . When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19 , Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome , where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius . The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family , with Caligula as the sole male survivor . Untouched by the deadly intrigues , Caligula accepted an invitation in 31 to join the emperor on the island of Capri , where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier . Following the death of Tiberius , Caligula succeeded his adoptive grandfather as emperor in 37 AD . There are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula , although he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule . After this , the sources focus upon his cruelty , sadism , extravagance , and sexual perversion , presenting him as an insane tyrant . While the reliability of these sources is questionable , it is known that during his brief reign , Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor , as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate . He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself , and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome : the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus .",

Born to Drusus and Antonia Minor at Lugdunum in Roman Gaul , where his father was stationed as a military legate , he was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy . Nonetheless , Claudius was an Italic of Sabine origins and a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty . Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age , his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship , shared with his nephew Caligula in 37 . Claudius 's infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius ' and Caligula 's reigns ; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat . His survival led to his being declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula 's assassination , at which point he was the last man of his family . Despite his lack of experience , Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator . He expanded the imperial bureaucracy to include freedmen , and helped to restore the empire 's finances after the excess of Caligula 's reign . He was also an ambitious builder , constructing many new roads , aqueducts , and canals across the Empire . During his reign the Empire started its successful conquest of Britain . Having a personal interest in law , he presided at public trials , and issued up to twenty edicts a day . He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign , particularly by elements of the nobility .",

[ note 1 ] He was born Publius Aelius Hadrianus in Italica , Hispania Baetica , into a Roman Italo-Hispanic family that settled in Spain from the Italian city of Atri in Picenum . His father was of senatorial rank and was a first cousin of Emperor Trajan . He married Trajan 's grand-niece Vibia Sabina early in his career , before Trajan became emperor and possibly at the behest of Trajan 's wife Pompeia Plotina . Plotina and Trajan 's close friend and adviser Lucius Licinius Sura were well disposed towards Hadrian . When Trajan died , his widow claimed that he had nominated Hadrian as emperor immediately before his death . Rome 's military and Senate approved Hadrian 's succession , but four leading senators were unlawfully put to death soon after . They had opposed Hadrian or seemed to threaten his succession , and the senate held him responsible for it and never forgave him . He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan 's expansionist policies and territorial gains in Mesopotamia , Assyria , Armenia , and parts of Dacia . Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable , defensible borders and the unification of the empire 's disparate peoples . He is known for building Hadrian 's Wall , which marked the northern limit of Britannia . Hadrian energetically pursued his own Imperial ideals and personal interests .",

His reign is commonly considered to mark the end of the golden period in the history of the Roman Empire known as the Pax Romana . During his father 's reign , he accompanied Marcus Aurelius during the Marcomannic Wars in 172 and on a tour of the Eastern provinces in 176 . He was made the youngest consul in Roman history in 177 and later that year elevated to co-emperor with his father . His accession was the first time a son had succeeded his biological father since Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79 . He was also the first emperor to have both a father and grandfather ( who had adopted his father ) as the two preceding emperors . Commodus was the first ( and until 337 , the only ) emperor born in the purple , meaning during his father 's reign . During his solo reign , the Empire enjoyed a period of reduced military conflict compared with the reign of Marcus Aurelius , but intrigues and conspiracies abounded , leading Commodus to an increasingly dictatorial style of leadership that culminated in a god-like personality cult . His assassination in 192 marked the end of the Nerva-Antonine dynasty . He was succeeded by Pertinax , the first emperor in the tumultuous Year of the Five Emperors .",

Born in Naissus , in Dacia Ripensis , the city now known as Ni\u0161 ( Serbian Cyrillic : \u041d\u0438\u0448 , located in Serbia ) , he was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius , a Roman Army officer of Illyrian origins . His mother , Helena , was Greek . His father became Caesar , the deputy emperor in the west , in AD 293 . Constantine was sent east , where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under Emperors Diocletian and Galerius . In 305 , Constantius was raised to the rank of Augustus , senior western emperor , and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia ( Britain ) . Constantine was acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum ( modern-day York ) after his father 's death in AD 306 . He emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against Emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by AD 324 . As emperor , Constantine enacted administrative , financial , social , and military reforms to strengthen the empire . He restructured the government , separating civil and military authorities . To combat inflation he introduced the solidus , a new gold coin that became the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years .

His rejection of Christianity , and his promotion of Neoplatonic Hellenism in its place , caused him to be remembered as Julian the Apostate by the Christian church . A member of the Constantinian dynasty , Julian was orphaned as a child . He was raised by the Gothic slave Mardonius , who had a profound influence on him , providing Julian with an excellent education . Julian became caesar over the western provinces by order of Constantius II in 355 , and in this role he campaigned successfully against the Alamanni and Franks . Most notable was his crushing victory over the Alamanni at the Battle of Argentoratum ( Strasbourg ) in 357 , leading his 13,000 men against a Germanic army three times larger . In 360 , Julian was proclaimed Augustus by his soldiers at Lutetia ( Paris ) , sparking a civil war with Constantius . However , Constantius died before the two could face each other in battle , and named Julian as his successor . In 363 , Julian embarked on an ambitious campaign against the Sassanid Empire . The campaign was initially successful , securing a victory outside Ctesiphon . However , while campaigning into Persian territory , the Persians flooded the area behind him and Julian took a risky decision to withdraw up the valley of the Tigris River . During the Battle of Samarra , Julian was mortally wounded under mysterious circumstances , leaving his army trapped in Persian territory .",

On his death , it became an official title of his successor , and was so used by Roman emperors thereafter . The feminine form Augusta was used for Roman empresses and other females of the Imperial family . The masculine and feminine forms originated in the time of the Roman Republic , in connection with things considered divine or sacred in traditional Roman religion . Their use as titles for major and minor Roman deities of the Empire associated the Imperial system and Imperial family with traditional Roman virtues and the divine will , and may be considered a feature of the Roman Imperial cult .

They spoke a language with no known close relatives , although it may be very distantly related to the Muskogean languages of the Creek Confederacy . The Natchez are noted for being the only Mississippian culture with complex chiefdom characteristics to have survived long into the period after the European colonization of America began . Others had generally declined a century or two before European encounter . The Natchez are also noted for having had an unusual social system of nobility classes and exogamous marriage practices . It was a strongly matrilineal kinship society , with descent reckoned along female lines . The paramount chief named the Great Sun was always the son of the Female Sun , whose daughter would be the mother of the next Great Sun . This ensured that the chiefdom stayed under the control of the single Sun lineage . Ethnologists have not reached consensus on how the Natchez social system originally functioned , and the topic is somewhat controversial . Around 1730 , after several wars with the French , the Natchez were defeated and dispersed . Most survivors were sold by the French into slavery in the West Indies ; others took refuge with other tribes , such as the Muskogean Chickasaw and Creek , and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee .

The Indonesian capital city , Jakarta , is located on its northwestern coast . Much of the well-known part of Indonesian history took place on Java . It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires , the Islamic sultanates , and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies . Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s . Java dominates Indonesia politically , economically and culturally .

It is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues . The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues , each seated inside a perforated stupa . Built in the 9th century during the reign of the Sailendra Dynasty , the temple design follows Javanese Buddhist architecture , which blends the Indonesian indigenous cult of ancestor worship and the Buddhist concept of attaining Nirvana . The temple demonstrates the influences of Gupta art that reflects India 's influence on the region , yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian . The monument is a shrine to the Lord Buddha and a place for Buddhist pilgrimage . The pilgrim journey begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the monument , ascending to the top through three levels symbolic of Buddhist cosmology : K\u0101madh\u0101tu ( the world of desire ) , R\u016bpadh\u0101tu ( the world of forms ) and Ar\u016bpadh\u0101tu ( the world of formlessness ) .

The Dalai Lama is also considered to be the successor in a line of tulkus who are believed to be incarnations of Avalokite\u015bvara , a Bodhisattva of Compassion . The name is a combination of the Mongolic word dalai meaning ocean or big ( coming from Mongolian title Dalaiyin qan or Dalaiin khan , translated as Gyatso in Tibetan ) and the Tibetan word \u0f56\u0fb3\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f0b ( bla-ma ) meaning master , guru . Since the time of the 5th Dalai Lama in the 17th century , his personage has always been a symbol of unification of the state of Tibet , where he has represented Buddhist values and traditions . The Dalai Lama was an important figure of the Geluk tradition , which was politically and numerically dominant in Central Tibet , but his religious authority went beyond sectarian boundaries . While he had no formal or institutional role in any of the religious traditions , which were headed by their own high lamas , he was a unifying symbol of the Tibetan state , representing Buddhist values and traditions above any specific school . The traditional function of the Dalai Lama as an ecumenical figure , holding together disparate religious and regional groups , has been taken up by the present fourteenth Dalai Lama . He has worked to overcome sectarian and other divisions in the exiled community and has become a symbol of Tibetan nationhood for Tibetans both in Tibet and in exile . From 1642 until 1705 and from 1750 to the 1950s , the Dalai Lamas or their regents headed the Tibetan government ( or Ganden Phodrang ) in Lhasa which governed all or most of the Tibetan Plateau with varying degrees of autonomy under the Qing Dynasty of China , in which Tibet had been under non-Tibetan suzerainty , and a period of disputed de facto independence between 1913 and 1951 . This Tibetan government also enjoyed the patronage and protection of firstly Mongol kings of the Khoshut and Dzungar Khanates ( 1642-1720 ) and then of the emperors of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty ( 1720-1912 ) . In 1913 , several Tibetan representatives including Agvan Dorzhiev signed a treaty between Tibet and Mongolia , proclaiming mutual recognition and their independence from China , however the legitimacy of the treaty and declared independence of Tibet was rejected by both the Republic of China and the current People 's Republic of China .",

Tibetan Buddhism is a form of Mahayana Buddhism stemming from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism ( and so is also part of the tantric Vajrayana tradition ) . It thus preserves the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India . However , it also includes native Tibetan developments and practices . In the pre-modern era , Tibetan Buddhism spread outside of Tibet primarily due to the influence of the Mongol Yuan dynasty ( 1271-1368 ) , founded by Kublai Khan , which ruled China , Mongolia and parts of Siberia . In the modern era , it has spread outside of Asia due to the efforts of the Tibetan diaspora . Apart from classical Mahayana Buddhist practices like the six perfections , Tibetan Buddhism also includes Tantric practices , such as deity yoga and the Six Dharmas of Naropa .

  "/wiki/Sapa_Inca": "The Sapa Inca ( Hispanicized spelling ) , Sapan Inka or Sapa Inka ( Quechua for the only Inca ) , also known as Apu ( divinity ) , Inka Qhapaq ( mighty Inca ) , or simply Sapa ( the only one ) , was the ruler of the Kingdom of Cuzco and , later , the Emperor of the Inca Empire ( Tawantinsuyu ) and the Neo-Inca State . While the origins of the position are mythical and originate from the legendary foundation of the city of Cusco , it seems to have come into being historically around 1100 CE . Although the Inca believed the Sapa to be the son of Inti ( the Inca Sun god ) and often referred to him as Intip Churin or Son of the Sun , the position eventually became hereditary , with son succeeding father . The principal wife of the Inca was known as the Coya or Qoya . The Sapa Inca was at the top of the social hierarchy , and played a dominant role in the political and spiritual realm . There were two known dynasties , led by the Hurin and Hanan moieties respectively . The latter was in power at the time of Spanish conquest . The last effective Sapa Inca of Inca Empire was Atahualpa , who was executed by Francisco Pizarro and his conquistadors in 1533 , but several successors later claimed the title .",

Founded by King Prithvi Narayan Shah , a Gorkhali monarch of Rajput origin from medieval India , it existed for 240 years until the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008 . During this period , Nepal was formally under the rule of the Shah dynasty , which exercised varying degrees of power during the kingdom 's existence . After the invasion of Tibet and plundering of Digarcha by Nepali forces under Prince Regent Bahadur Shah in 1792 , the Dalai Lama and Chinese Ambans reported to Chinese administration for military support . The Chinese and Tibetan forces under Fu Kang An attacked Nepal but went for negotiation after failure at Nuwakot . MulKaji Damodar Pande was the most influential Kaji among the four Kajis appointed after removal of Bahadur Shah of Nepal even though Chief ( Mul ) Kaji was Kirtiman Singh Basnyat . MulKaji Damodar Pande tried to protect king Girvan Yuddha Shah and keep Rana Bahadur off of Nepal . However , in 1804 , March 4 , the former king came back and took over the post of Mukhtiyar and Damodar Pande was then beheaded and killed in Thankot . The 1806 Bhandarkhal massacre instigated upon the death of King Rana Bahadur Shah , set forth the rise of authoritative Mukhtiyar ( premier ) Bhimsen Thapa who became de facto ruler of Nepal from 1806 to 1837 . During the early nineteenth century , however , the expansion of the East India Company 's rule in India led to the Anglo-Nepalese War ( 1814-1816 ) , which resulted in Nepal 's defeat . Under the Sugauli Treaty , the kingdom retained its independence , but in exchange for territorial concessions making Mechi River to Mahakali River its boundary under Nepalese rule , sometimes known as Greater Nepal . In the political scenario , the death of Prime Minister Mathbar Singh ended the Thapa hegemony and set the stage for Kot massacre which resulted in the ascendancy of the Rana dynasty of Khas Rajput ( Chhetri ) origin , which made the office of Prime Minister of Nepal hereditary in their family for the next century , from 1843 to 1951 .",
