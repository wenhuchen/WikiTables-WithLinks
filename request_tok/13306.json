For three decades in the 20th century , it was a prominent force and leader in American television animation as it created a variety of popular animated characters and a succession of cartoon series , including The Huckleberry Hound Show , The Flintstones , The Yogi Bear Show , The Jetsons , Wacky Races , Scooby-Doo , Where Are You ! and The Smurfs . Its cartoons won eight Emmys and seven Oscars and in addition , Hanna and Barbera were honored a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . The two men and Sidney sold the studio to Taft Broadcasting on December 29 , 1966 . By the mid-1980s , when the profitability of Saturday-morning cartoons was eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication , Hanna-Barbera 's fortunes had declined . Turner Broadcasting System purchased the studio from Taft ( by then renamed Great American Broadcasting ) in late 1991 and used much of its back catalog as the foundation and programming for Cartoon Network and later Boomerang . After Turner purchased the company , Hanna and Barbera continued to serve as creative consultants and mentors . The studio became a subsidiary of Warner Bros . Animation in 1996 following Turner 's merger with Time Warner and was ultimately absorbed into Warner Bros . Animation in 2001 , existing in name only . As of 2020 , Warner Bros. continues to produce new animation based on Hanna-Barbera 's catalog using the Hanna-Barbera brand name .",
