  "/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)": "In baseball , the batting average ( BA ) is the number of hits divided by at bats . It is usually rounded to three decimal places and read without the decimal : A player with a batting average of .300 is batting three-hundred . If necessary to break ties , batting averages could be taken beyond the .001 measurement . In this context , .001 is considered a point , such that a .235 batter is 5 points higher than a .230 batter .",
  "/wiki/Babe_Ruth": "George Herman Babe Ruth Jr. ( February 6 , 1895 - August 16 , 1948 ) was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) spanned 22 seasons , from 1914 through 1935 . Nicknamed The Bambino and The Sultan of Swat , he began his MLB career as a star left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox , but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees . Ruth established many MLB batting ( and some pitching ) records , including career home runs ( 714 ) , runs batted in ( RBIs ) ( 2,213 ) , bases on balls ( 2,062 ) , slugging percentage ( .690 ) , and on-base plus slugging ( OPS ) ( 1.164 ) ; the last two still stand as of 2019 [ update ] . Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time . In 1936 , Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five inaugural members . At age seven , Ruth was sent to St. Mary 's Industrial School for Boys , a reformatory where he was mentored by Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Xaverian Brothers , the school 's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player . In 1914 , Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox . By 1916 , he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs , a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era . Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Red Sox , he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder . With regular playing time , he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 . After that season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy . The trade fueled Boston 's subsequent 86-year championship drought and popularized the Curse of the Bambino superstition .",
  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",
  "/wiki/Roger_Maris": "Roger Eugene Maris ( September 10 , 1934 - December 14 , 1985 ) was an American professional baseball right fielder . He is best known for setting a new Major League Baseball single-season home run record with 61 home runs in 1961 ; the record remained unbroken until 1998 . Maris played in the minor leagues from 1953 to 1956 , and in the major leagues from 1957 to 1968 . He reached the major leagues in 1957 as a player for the Cleveland Indians . He was traded to the Kansas City Athletics during the 1958 season , and to the New York Yankees after the 1959 season . Maris finished his playing career as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1967 and 1968 . Maris was an American League ( AL ) All-Star from 1959 through 1962 , [ a ] an AL Most Valuable Player in 1960 and 1961 , and an AL Gold Glove Award winner in 1960 . Maris appeared in seven World Series ; he played for Yankees teams that won the World Series in 1961 and 1962 and for a Cardinals team that won the World Series in 1967 . Maris ' home run record was controversial . The previous single-season home run record ( 60 , set by Babe Ruth in 1927 ) was set during a period when Major League Baseball teams played 154 games per season . Before Maris broke Ruth 's record , the American League baseball season had been extended to 162 games . Maris hit his 61st home run in the very last game of the season , which led to questions about the legitimacy of his record .",
  "/wiki/50_home_run_club": "In Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , the 50 home run club is the group of batters who have hit 50 or more home runs in a single season . Babe Ruth was the first to achieve this , doing so in 1920 . By reaching the milestone , he also became the first player to hit 30 and then 40 home runs in a single-season , breaking his own record of 29 from the 1919 season . Ruth subsequently became the first player to reach the 50 home run club on four occasions , repeating the achievement in 1921 , 1927 and 1928 . He remained the only player to accomplish this until Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa matched his feat in 1999 and 2001 , respectively , thus becoming the only players to achieve four consecutive 50 home run seasons . Barry Bonds hit the most home runs to join the club , collecting 73 in 2001 . The most recent player to reach the milestone is Pete Alonso , achieving the feat during the 2019 season . In total , 30 players have reached the 50 home run club in MLB history and nine have done so more than once . Of these , eighteen were right-handed batters , eleven were left-handed , and one was a switch hitter , meaning he could bat from either side of the plate . Five of these players ( including three active members of the 50 home run club ) have played for only one major league team . The New York Yankees are the only franchise to have five players reach the milestone while on their roster : Ruth , Mickey Mantle , Roger Maris , Alex Rodriguez , and Aaron Judge . Ten players are also members of the 500 home run club and two of them ( Willie Mays and Rodriguez ) are also members of the 3,000 hit club .",
  "/wiki/Run_batted_in": "A run batted in ( RBI ) , plural runs batted in ( RBI or RBIs ) , is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored ( except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play ) . For example , if the batter bats a base hit , then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run , and the batter gets credited with batting in that run . Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season , runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic . Nevertheless , the RBI statistic was tabulated - unofficially - from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan , according to the Society for American Baseball Research . Common nicknames for an RBI include ribby ( or ribbie ) , rib , and ribeye . The plural of RBI is generally RBIs , although some commentators use RBI as both singular and plural , as it can also stand for runs batted in .",
  "/wiki/Lou_Gehrig": "Henry Louis Gehrig ( born Heinrich Ludwig Gehrig ; June 19 , 1903 - June 2 , 1941 ) was an American professional baseball first baseman who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the New York Yankees ( 1923-1939 ) . Gehrig was renowned for his prowess as a hitter and for his durability , which earned him his nickname The Iron Horse . He was an All-Star seven consecutive times , a Triple Crown winner once , an American League ( AL ) Most Valuable Player twice , and a member of six World Series champion teams . He had a career .340 batting average , .632 slugging average , and a .447 on base average . He hit 493 home runs and had 1,995 runs batted in ( RBI ) . He still has the highest ratio of runs scored plus runs batted in per 100 plate appearances ( 35.08 ) and per 100 games ( 156.7 ) among Hall of Fame players . In 1939 , he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the first MLB player to have his uniform number ( 4 ) retired by a team . A native of New York City and a student at Columbia University , Gehrig signed with the Yankees in 1923 . He set several major-league records during his career , including the most career grand slams ( 23 ) ( since broken by Alex Rodriguez ) and most consecutive games played ( 2,130 ) , a record that stood for 56 years and was long considered unbreakable until surpassed by Cal Ripken Jr. , in 1995 . Gehrig 's consecutive game streak ended on May 2 , 1939 , when he voluntarily took himself out of the lineup , stunning both players and fans , after his performance on the field became hampered by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , an incurable neuromuscular illness ; it is now commonly referred to in North America as Lou Gehrig 's disease . The disease forced him to retire at age 36 , and was the cause of his death two years later . The pathos of his farewell from baseball was capped off by his iconic 1939 Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth speech at Yankee Stadium .",
  "/wiki/Run_(baseball)": "In baseball , a run is scored when a player advances around first , second and third base and returns safely to home plate , touching the bases in that order , before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured . A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely on base ( that is , on first , second , or third ) as a runner and subsequently brings him home . The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent . The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then , even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made , his run does not count . However , if the third out is not a force out , but a tag out , then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made , his run will count . In baseball statistics , a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run ( R ) , sometimes referred to as a run scored . While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic , it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in ( RBIs ) . Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent ; however , the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player 's contribution toward producing runs for his team . A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics , which differentiate between standard earned runs ( for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility ) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors , which do not count in his personal statistics . Specifically , if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning , the Official Scorer - the official in-game statistician - in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned , will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred . For example , with two outs , suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error , and then the next batter hits a two-run home run , and then the following batter then makes the third out , ending the inning . If the inning is reconstructed without the error , and if that third batter , instead of reaching on an error , registered an out , the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring .",

  "/wiki/Don_Mattingly": "Donald Arthur Mattingly ( born April 20 , 1961 ) is an American former professional baseball first baseman , coach , and current manager for the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . Nicknamed The Hit Man and Donnie Baseball , he spent his entire 14-year career playing with the New York Yankees and later managed the Los Angeles Dodgers for five years . Mattingly graduated from Reitz Memorial High School in Evansville , Indiana , and was selected by the Yankees in the amateur draft . Debuting with the Yankees in 1982 after three seasons in minor league baseball , Mattingly emerged as the Yankees ' starting first baseman after a successful rookie season in 1983 . Mattingly was named to the American League ( AL ) All-Star team six times . He won nine Gold Glove Awards ( an American League record for a first baseman ) , three Silver Slugger Awards , the 1984 AL batting title , and was the 1985 AL Most Valuable Player . Mattingly served as captain of the Yankees from 1991 through 1995 , when he retired as a player . The Yankees later retired Mattingly 's uniform number , 23 . Mattingly is the only Yankee to have his number retired without having won a World Series with the team . Returning to the Yankees as a coach in 2004 for manager Joe Torre , he followed Torre to the Dodgers in 2008 , and succeeded him as the Dodgers ' manager in 2011 . The Dodgers and Mattingly mutually parted ways after the 2015 season , and he became manager of the Miami Marlins .",
  "/wiki/Single_(baseball)": "In baseball , a single is the most common type of base hit , accomplished through the act of a batter safely reaching first base by hitting a fair ball ( thus becoming a runner ) and getting to first base before a fielder puts him out . As an exception , a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on the first play ; this is one type of a fielder 's choice . Also , a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder 's error trying to put him out at first base or another runner out ( as a fielder 's choice ) is not credited with a single . On a single hit to the outfield , any runners on second base or third base normally score , and sometimes the runner from first base is able to advance to third base . Depending on the location of the hit , a quick recovery by the outfielder can prevent such an advance or create a play on the advancing runner . Hitters who focus on hitting singles rather than doubles or home runs are often called contact hitters . Contact hitters who rely on positioning their hits well and having fast running speed to achieve singles are often called slap hitters . Ty Cobb , Pete Rose , Tony Gwynn , and Ichiro Suzuki are examples of contact hitters ; of these , Rose and Suzuki might be called slap hitters .",

  "/wiki/Double_(baseball)": "In baseball , a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire , without the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) or another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A double is a type of hit ( the others being the single , triple and home run ) and is sometimes called a two-bagger or two-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 2B .",
  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error .",

  "/wiki/Stolen_base": "In baseball , a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner . The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base , but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 .

Extra-base hits are often not listed separately in tables of baseball statistics , but are easily determined by calculating the sum total of a batter 's doubles , triples , and home runs . Another related statistic of interest that can be calculated is extra bases on long hits . A batter gets three of these for each home run , two for each triple , and one for each double .

  "/wiki/Base_on_balls": "A base on balls ( BB ) , also known as a walk , occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls , and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out . The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball 's Official Rules , and further detail is given in 6.08 ( a ) . It is , however , considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base ; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play . The term base on balls distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out ( e.g. , hit by pitch ( HBP ) , catcher 's interference ) . Though a base on balls , catcher 's interference , or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter ( and possibly runners on base ) being awarded a base , the term walk usually refers only to a base on balls , and not the other methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball . An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher 's interference , the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced ; the ball is live after a walk ( see below for details ) . A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been walked by the pitcher . When the batter is walked , runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base . If a batter draws a walk with the bases loaded , all preceding runners are forced to advance , including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run ; when a run is forced on a walk , the batter is credited with an RBI per rule 10.04 . Receiving a base on balls does not count as a hit or an at bat for a batter but does count as a time on base and a plate appearance . Therefore , a base on balls does not affect a player 's batting average , but it can increase his on-base percentage . A hit by pitch is not counted statistically as a walk , though the effect is mostly the same , with the batter receiving a free pass to first base .",

A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out .
