Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories , of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part , and of the District of Assiniboia . The site was previously called Wascana ( Buffalo Bones in Cree ) , but was renamed to Regina ( Latin for Queen ) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria . This decision was made by Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Louise , who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada , the Marquess of Lorne . Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek . Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre ( 850 ft ) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake . Regina 's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906 ."
