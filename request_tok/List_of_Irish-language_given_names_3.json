Originally a patronymic , Owen became a fixed surname in Wales beginning with the reign of Henry VIII . Etymologists consider it to originate from Eugene meaning 'noble-born ' . According to T. J.

LL gives the names Euguen , Iguein , Yuein , Ouein . The corresponding form in Irish is Eoghan . Morgan and Morgan note that there are less likely alternative explanations , and agree with Rachel Bromwich that Welsh Owein is normally latinised as Eugenius , and that both the Welsh and Irish forms are Latin derivatives . The Welsh name is a cognate and near-homonym of the Irish name E\u00f3gan ( pronounced /'o\u02d0\u0259un/ , partially anglicised as Eoghan , as noted by Morgan and Morgan , among other spellings ) . As such , the given name Owney is usually regarded as a diminutive of either Owen or Eoghan .
