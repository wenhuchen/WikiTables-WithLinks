However , the ADQ 's popularity declined significantly soon afterward and in the 2008 provincial elections , the party failed to secure at least twenty percent of the popular vote or twelve Members of the National Assembly ( MNAs ) in the last election , and consequently lost official party status , though in early 2009 it was recognised as an official party by the PLQ and the PQ .
