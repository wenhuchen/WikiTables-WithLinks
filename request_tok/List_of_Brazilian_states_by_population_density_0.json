  "/wiki/Tuvalu": "Tuvalu ( /tu\u02d0\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0lu\u02d0/ too-VAH-loo ) ( formerly known as the Ellice Islands ) , is a country in Polynesia , located in the Pacific Ocean , situated in Oceania and about midway between Hawaii and Australia . The island country lies east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands ( which belong to the Solomon Islands ) , southeast of Nauru , south of Kiribati , west of Tokelau , northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna , and north of Fiji . It is composed of three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 south and longitude of 176\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 , west of the International Date Line . Tuvalu has a population of 11,192 ( 2017 census ) . The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres ( 10 sq mi ) . The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians . The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago . During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes . The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls , with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia . In 1568 , Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to sail through the archipelago , sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis . The island of Funafuti was named Ellice 's Island in 1819 ; the name Ellice was applied to all of the nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay . The Ellice Islands came into Great Britain 's sphere of influence in the late 19th century , as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean .",

The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation .

It is bordered by Chad to the north , Sudan to the northeast , South Sudan to the southeast , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south , the Republic of the Congo to the southwest and Cameroon to the west . The CAR covers a land area of about 620,000 square kilometres ( 240,000 sq mi ) and had an estimated population of around 4.7 million as of 2018 [ update ] . As of 2020 [ update ] , the CAR is the scene of a civil war , ongoing since 2012 . Most of the CAR consists of Sudano-Guinean savannas , but the country also includes a Sahelo-Sudanian zone in the north and an equatorial forest zone in the south . Two thirds of the country is within the Ubangi River basin ( which flows into the Congo ) , while the remaining third lies in the basin of the Chari , which flows into Lake Chad . What is today the Central African Republic has been inhabited for millennia ; however , the country 's current borders were established by France , which ruled the country as a colony starting in the late 19th century . After gaining independence from France in 1960 , the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders , including an abortive attempt at a monarchy ; by the 1990s , calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993 . Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9 became president , but was later removed by General Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 in the 2003 coup . The Central African Republic Bush War began in 2004 and , despite a peace treaty in 2007 and another in 2011 , civil war resumed in 2012 . Despite its significant mineral deposits and other resources , such as uranium reserves , crude oil , gold , diamonds , cobalt , lumber , and hydropower , as well as significant quantities of arable land , the Central African Republic is among the ten poorest countries in the world , with the lowest GDP per capita at purchasing power parity in the world as of 2017 . As of 2019 [ update ] , according to the Human Development Index ( HDI ) , the country had the second lowest level of human development , ranking 188th out of 189 countries .",
