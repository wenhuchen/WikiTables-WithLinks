  "/wiki/Short_dance": "The short dance ( SD ) was the first segment of an ice dancing competition from the 2010-2011 to the 2017-2018 seasons . It was approved in June 2010 by the International Skating Union ( ISU ) . It merged the original dance ( OD ) and compulsory dance ( CD ) , which were both discontinued . The ISU re-named the short dance to the rhythm dance ( RD ) in 2018 . The SD was composed of two parts : the pattern dance ( formerly known as the compulsory dance ) , which lasted about one minute and could be placed anywhere in the SD , and the creative section , which took up most of the SD . The pattern dance changed each year , and was announced beforehand by the ISU . The ISU also published yearly rule changes . Ice dancers were expected to perform five required elements in their SD : two segments of the pattern dance , one short lift , a step sequence , and a set of twizzles . At first , the duration of the SD was two minutes and 50 seconds ; in 2016 , it was changed to two minutes and 40 seconds . The first SD in international competitions was performed by U.S. junior ice dancers Anastasia Cannuscio and Colin McManus .",
