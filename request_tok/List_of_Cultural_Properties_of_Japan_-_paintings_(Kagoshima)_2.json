The Acad\u00e9mie was established in the 19th century as an alternative to the government-sanctioned \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts that had , in the eyes of many promising young artists at the time , become far too conservative . Along with its equivalent Acad\u00e9mie Julian , and unlike the official \u00c9cole , the Colarossi school accepted female students and allowed them to draw from the nude male model . Among the female attendees were Jeanne H\u00e9buterne , Modigliani 's muse ; Scottish Impressionist Bessie MacNicol ; Canadian Impressionist Emily Carr ; and French sculptor Camille Claudel , who was also a student of Rodin 's . Noted also for its classes in life sculpting , the school attracted many foreign students , including a large number from the United States . In 1910 , the progressive Acad\u00e9mie appointed the New Zealand artist Frances Hodgkins ( 1869-1947 ) as its first female teacher . Among its other instructors were the influential French sculptor Jean Antoine Injalbert and the Japanese-influenced painter Raphael Collin . In 1922 sculptor Henry Moore attended , although not as a student . Moore took life-drawing classes that were open to the general public , paid for with a book of inexpensive tickets . The evening classes were progressively timed - one hour , then 20 minutes , then five minutes , then one - to develop various drawing skills .",
