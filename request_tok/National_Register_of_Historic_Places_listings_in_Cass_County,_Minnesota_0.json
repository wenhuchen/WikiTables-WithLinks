Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites .

  "/wiki/Swing_bridge": "A swing bridge is a movable bridge that has as its primary structural support a vertical locating pin and support ring , usually at or near to its center of gravity , about which the turning span can then pivot horizontally as shown in the animated illustration to the right . Small swing bridges as found over canals may be pivoted only at one end , opening as would a gate , but require substantial underground structure to support the pivot . In its closed position , a swing bridge carrying a road or railway over a river or canal , for example , allows traffic to cross . When a water vessel needs to pass the bridge , road traffic is stopped ( usually by traffic signals and barriers ) , and then motors rotate the bridge horizontally about its pivot point . The typical swing bridge will rotate approximately 90 degrees , or one-quarter turn ; however , a bridge which intersects the navigation channel at an oblique angle may be built to rotate only 45 degrees , or one-eighth turn , in order to clear the channel .",

  "/wiki/Paleo-Indians": "Paleo-Indians , Paleoindians or Paleoamericans , were the first peoples who entered , and subsequently inhabited , the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period .

The term Paleo-Indians applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere and is distinct from the term Paleolithic . Traditional theories suggest that big-animal hunters crossed the Bering Strait from North Asia into the Americas over a land-and-ice bridge ( Beringia ) . This bridge existed from 45,000 to 12,000 BCE ( 47,000-14,000 BP ) . Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska . From c. 16,500 - c. 13,500 BCE ( c. 18,500 - c. 15,500 BP ) , ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America . This allowed animals , followed by humans , to migrate south into the interior of the continent . The people went on foot or used primitive boats along the coastline . The precise dates and routes of the peopling of the New World remain subjects of ongoing debate . At least two morphologically different Paleo-Indian populations were coexisting in different geographical areas of Mexico 10,000 years ago .

The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States .
