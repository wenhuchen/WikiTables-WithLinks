In the case of televised sports coverage , commentators are usually presented as a voiceover , with images of the contest shown on viewers ' screens and sounds of the action and spectators heard in the background . Television commentators are rarely shown on screen during an event , though some networks choose to feature their announcers on camera either before or after the contest or briefly during breaks in the action ."
