The railway also made it possible to exploit the timber resources of Northern Ontario .

There is one major branchline running eastward from Swastika through Kirkland Lake and over the Quebec border to end at Rouyn-Noranda . The railway 's branch from Swastika to Rouyn-Noranda , including 40 kilometres of track in Quebec , is operated by a subsidiary , the Nipissing Central Railway .
