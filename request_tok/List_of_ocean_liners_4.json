The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies , but did not completely coordinate their activity . The Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany , Italy and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s . The first step was the treaty signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936 . Benito Mussolini declared on 1 November that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome-Berlin axis , thus creating the term Axis . The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the Anti-Comintern Pact , an anti-communist treaty between Germany and Japan . Italy and Spain joined the Pact in 1937 . The Rome-Berlin Axis became a military alliance in 1939 under the so-called Pact of Steel , with the Tripartite Pact of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany , Italy and Japan . At its zenith during World War II , the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of Europe , North Africa , and East Asia . There were no three-way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal , with slightly more between Germany and Italy . The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance . As in the case of the Allies , membership of the Axis was fluid , with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war .",
