Long after he was shunned by his family , Royal gradually reconciles with his children and ex-wife ( Huston ) . With a variety of influences , including Louis Malle 's 1963 film The Fire Within and Orson Welles ' 1942 film The Magnificent Ambersons , the story involves themes of the dysfunctional family , lost greatness , and redemption . An absurdist and ironic sense of humor pervades the film , which features a soundtrack subsequently released in two albums . The Royal Tenenbaums was shot in and around New York City , including a house in Harlem used for the Tenenbaum residence . The filmmakers went to efforts to distinguish the film 's backgrounds from a recognizable New York , with fashions and sets combining the appearances of different time periods .

A spin-off of Dallas , it was set in a fictitious coastal suburb of Los Angeles and initially centered on the lives of four married couples living in a cul-de-sac , Seaview Circle . By the time of its conclusion , storylines had included rape , murder , kidnapping , assassinations , drug smuggling , corporate intrigue , and criminal investigations ; and it had become the longest-running primetime drama on U.S. television after Gunsmoke and Bonanza . Knots Landing was created by David Jacobs ( one-time writer of Family and later producer of Lois & Clark : The New Adventures of Superman ) in conjunction with producer Michael Filerman ( who would also later co-produce Falcon Crest ) . Although a spin-off of Dallas , the concept predates that series , and was rebuffed by CBS in 1977 , as the network wanted something more saga-like . Jacobs then created Dallas , which the network accepted and premiered in 1978 . After Dallas became a hit , Jacobs was then able to adapt Knots Landing as a spin-off series by way of incorporating characters introduced in the parent series . The series was largely inspired by a 1957 movie No Down Payment but also by the 1973 Ingmar Bergman television miniseries Scenes from a Marriage . Though not as popular in the ratings as Dallas , Knots Landing eventually outlasted it and garnered much critical acclaim . The series peaked during the 1983-84 season with a 20.8 rating ( when it finished in 11th place ) and a 20.0 rating for the 1984-85 season ( finishing 9th ) . This can be attributed , in part , to more dramatic storylines as the series became more soap opera-like , and the gradual inclusion of newer characters to interact with the original cast . By the 1988-89 season , Knots Landing was ahead of Dallas in the ratings , though audiences for both shows by this time were less than their earlier years .",
