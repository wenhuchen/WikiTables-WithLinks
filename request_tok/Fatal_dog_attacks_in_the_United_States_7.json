  "/wiki/Pit_bull": "Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers . The pit bull-type is particularly ambiguous , as it encompasses a range of pedigree breeds , informal types and appearances that can not be reliably identified . Formal breeds often considered to be of the pit bull-type include the American Pit Bull Terrier , American Staffordshire Terrier , American Bully , and Staffordshire Bull Terrier . The American Bulldog is also sometimes included . Mixed-breed dogs which physically resemble these breeds often get labelled as pit bulls by shelters . Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from crossbreeding bull-baiting dogs ( used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls ) and terriers . After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned , such dogs were used as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs , to hunt and drive livestock , and as family companions . Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States , it still exists as an underground activity , and pit bulls are a common type used . According to the American Veterinary Medical Association , owners of pit bull-type dogs deal with a strong breed stigma ; however , controlled studies have not identified this breed group as disproportionately dangerous . Because owners of stigmatized breeds are more likely to have involvement in criminal or violent acts , breed correlations may have the owner 's behavior as the underlying causal factor . Some jurisdictions have enacted legislation banning the group of breeds , and some insurance companies do not cover liability from pit bull bites . Among other roles , pit bulls have served as police dogs , search and rescue dogs , and several have appeared on film .",
