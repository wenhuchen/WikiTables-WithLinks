  "/wiki/Liberalism": "Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on liberty , consent of the governed and equality before the law . Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles , but they generally support free market , free trade , limited government , individual rights ( including civil rights and human rights ) , capitalism , democracy , secularism , gender equality , racial equality , internationalism , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and freedom of religion . Yellow is the political colour most commonly associated with liberalism . Liberalism became a distinct movement in the Age of Enlightenment , when it became popular among Western philosophers and economists . Liberalism sought to replace the norms of hereditary privilege , state religion , absolute monarchy , the divine right of kings and traditional conservatism with representative democracy and the rule of law . Liberals also ended mercantilist policies , royal monopolies and other barriers to trade , instead promoting free trade and free markets . Philosopher John Locke is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct tradition , based on the social contract , arguing that each man has a natural right to life , liberty and property and governments must not violate these rights . While the British liberal tradition has emphasized expanding democracy , French liberalism has emphasized rejecting authoritarianism and is linked to nation-building . Leaders in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 , the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789 used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of royal tyranny . Liberalism started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution . The 19th century saw liberal governments established in nations across Europe and South America , whereas it was well-established alongside republicanism in the United States . In Victorian Britain , it was used to critique the political establishment , appealing to science and reason on behalf of the people .",

  "/wiki/Islamism": "Islamism is a concept whose meaning has been debated in both public and academic contexts . The term can refer to diverse forms of social and political activism advocating that public and political life should be guided by Islamic principles or more specifically to movements which call for full implementation of sharia ( Islamic order or law ) . It is commonly used interchangeably with the terms political Islam or Islamic fundamentalism . In academic usage , the term Islamism does not specify what vision of Islamic order or sharia are being advocated , or how their advocates intend to bring them about . In Western mass media it tends to refer to groups whose aim is to establish a sharia-based Islamic state , often with implication of violent tactics and human rights violations , and has acquired connotations of political extremism . In the Muslim world , the term has positive connotations among its proponents . Different currents of Islamist thought include advocating a revolutionary strategy of Islamizing society through exercise of state power , and alternately a reformist strategy to re-Islamizing society through grass-roots social and political activism . Islamists may emphasize the implementation of sharia ; pan-Islamic political unity , including an Islamic state ; or selective removal of non-Muslim , particularly Western military , economic , political , social , or cultural influences in the Muslim world that they believe to be incompatible with Islam . Graham Fuller has argued for a broader notion of Islamism as a form of identity politics , involving support for [ Muslim ] identity , authenticity , broader regionalism , revivalism , [ and ] revitalization of the community . Some authors hold the term Islamic activism to be synonymous and preferable to Islamism , and Rached Ghannouchi writes that Islamists prefer to use the term Islamic movement themselves . Central and prominent figures in twentieth-century Islamism include Hasan al-Banna , Sayyid Qutb , Abul Ala Maududi , and Ruhollah Khomeini . Most Islamist thinkers emphasize peaceful political processes , which are supported by the majority of contemporary Islamists .",

  "/wiki/Socialism": "Socialism is a political , social and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production and workers ' self-management of enterprise , including the political theories and movements associated with such systems . Social ownership can be public , collective or cooperative ownership , or citizen ownership of equity . There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them , with social ownership being the common element shared by its various forms . Socialist systems are divided into non-market and market forms . Non-market socialism involves replacing factor markets and money with engineering and technical criteria based on calculation performed in-kind , thereby producing an economic mechanism that functions according to different economic laws from those of capitalism . Non-market socialism aims to circumvent the inefficiencies and crises traditionally associated with capital accumulation and the profit system . The socialist calculation debate , originated by the economic calculation problem , concerns the feasibility and methods of resource allocation for a planned socialist system . By contrast , market socialism retains the use of monetary prices , factor markets and in some cases the profit motive , with respect to the operation of socially owned enterprises and the allocation of capital goods between them . Profits generated by these firms would be controlled directly by the workforce of each firm , or accrue to society at large in the form of a social dividend . Socialist politics has been both internationalist and nationalist in orientation ; organised through political parties and opposed to party politics ; at times overlapping with trade unions and at other times independent and critical of them ; and present in both industrialised and developing nations . Social democracy originated within the socialist movement , supporting economic and social interventions to promote social justice . While having socialism as a long-term goal , it has come to embrace a Keynesian mixed economy within a predominantly , developed capitalist market economy and liberal democratic polity that includes substantial state intervention in the form of income redistribution , regulation and a welfare state .",

  "/wiki/Secularism": "Secularism , as defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary , is indifference to , or rejection or exclusion of , religion and religious considerations . In certain contexts , the word can connote anticlericalism , atheism , desire to exclude religion from social activities or civic affairs , banishment of religious symbols from the public sphere , state neutrality toward religion , the separation of religion from state , or disestablishment ( separation of church and state ) . As a philosophy , secularism seeks to interpret life on principles taken solely from the material world , without recourse to religion . Secularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as Zeno of Citium and Marcus Aurelius ; from Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke , Denis Diderot , Voltaire , Baruch Spinoza , James Madison , Thomas Jefferson , and Thomas Paine ; and from more recent freethinkers atheists such as Matthew W. Dillahunty , Robert Ingersoll , Bertrand Russell , and Christopher Hitchens . It shifts the focus from religion to other temporal and this-worldly things , with emphasis on nature , reason , science , and development . In political terms , secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institutions and religious dignitaries ( the attainment of such is termed secularity ) . Defined briefly , secularism means that governments should remain neutral on the matter of religion and should not enforce nor prohibit the free exercise of religion , leaving religious choice to the liberty of the people . One form of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings , or , in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief , from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people . [ Notes 1 ] Another form of secularism is the view that public activities and decisions , especially political ones , should be uninfluenced by religious beliefs or practices . [ Notes 2 ] There exist distinct traditions of secularism in the West ( e.g. , French and Anglo-American ) and beyond ( e.g. , in India ) . The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely . In European laicism , it has been argued that secularism is a movement toward modernization , and away from traditional religious values ( also known as secularization ) .",

The Salafist doctrine is based on looking back to the early years of the religion to understand how the contemporary Muslims should practise their faith . They reject religious innovation or bid'ah , and support the implementation of sharia ( Islamic law ) . The movement is often divided into three categories : the largest group are the purists ( or quietists ) , who avoid politics ; the second largest group are the activists , who get involved in politics ; the third group are the jihadists , who form a minority and advocate armed struggle to restore the early Islamic movement . In legal matters , the Salafi are divided between those who , in the name of independent legal judgement ( ijtihad ) , reject strict adherence ( taqlid ) to the four Sunni schools of law ( madhahib ) , and others who remain faithful to these . In the Persian Gulf states , the majority of the Salafis reside in Qatar , United Arab Emirates , and Saudi Arabia . 46.87 per cent of Qataris and 44.8 per cent of Emiratis are Salafis . Salafis are the dominant minority in Saudi Arabia . The 4 million Saudi Salafis make up 22.9 per cent of the population .",
