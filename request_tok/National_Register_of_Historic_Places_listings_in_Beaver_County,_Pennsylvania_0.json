Ohio is bordered by Lake Erie to the north , Pennsylvania to the east , West Virginia to the southeast , Kentucky to the southwest , Indiana to the west , and Michigan to the northwest . The state takes its name from the Ohio River , whose name in turn originated from the Seneca word ohi\u02d0yo ' , meaning good river , great river or large creek . Partitioned from the Northwest Territory , Ohio was the 17th state admitted to the Union on March 1 , 1803 , and the first under the Northwest Ordinance . Ohio is historically known as the Buckeye State after its Ohio buckeye trees , and Ohioans are also known as Buckeyes . Ohio rose from the wilderness of Ohio Country west of Appalachia in colonial times through the Northwest Indian Wars as part of the Northwest Territory in the early frontier , to become the first non-colonial free state admitted to the union , to an industrial powerhouse in the 20th century before transitioning to a more information and service based economy in the 21st . The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch , led by the governor ; the legislative branch , which comprises the bicameral Ohio General Assembly ; and the judicial branch , led by the state Supreme Court . Ohio occupies 16 seats in the United States House of Representatives . Ohio is known for its status as both a swing state and a bellwether in national elections .

Among its contributing properties are three churches , the Keystone Bakery , and the William B. Dunlap Mansion , which is separately listed on the Register . Because the bridge spans the Beaver River to Rochester , a small portion of the district is located in Rochester . Another building in the district is the house of Joseph Hemphill , a local landowner who platted much of Bridgewater in 1818 . Built in 1818 , it is Bridgewater 's oldest extant house . During Bridgewater 's heyday , Bridge Street was a vibrant downtown street . Its buildings housed a wide variety of businesses , ranging from offices to stores to metalworking shops .

  "/wiki/Lock_(water_transport)": "A lock is a device used for raising and lowering boats , ships and other watercraft between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal waterways . The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber in which the water level can be varied ; whereas in a caisson lock , a boat lift , or on a canal inclined plane , it is the chamber itself ( usually then called a caisson ) that rises and falls . Locks are used to make a river more easily navigable , or to allow a canal to cross land that is not level . Later canals used more and larger locks to allow a more direct route to be taken . Since 2016 , the largest lock worldwide is the Kieldrecht Lock in the Port of Antwerp , Belgium .",
  "/wiki/Dam": "A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams . Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation , human consumption , industrial use , aquaculture , and navigability . Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity . A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations . Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water , while other structures such as floodgates or levees ( also known as dikes ) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions . The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan , dating to 3,000 BC . The word dam can be traced back to Middle English , and before that , from Middle Dutch , as seen in the names of many old cities . The first known appearance of dam occurs in 1165 . However , there is one village , Obdam , that is already mentioned in 1120 . The word seems to be related to the Greek word taphos , meaning grave or grave hill . [ citation needed ] So the word should be understood as dike from dug out earth . The names of more than 40 places ( with minor changes ) from the Middle Dutch era ( 1150-1500 CE ) such as Amsterdam ( founded as 'Amstelredam ' in the late 12th century ) and Rotterdam , also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Senate": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

  "/wiki/Recreational_Demonstration_Area": "The Recreational Demonstration Area program ( also known as the Recreation Demonstration Area program ) was a National Park Service program during the 1930s and early 1940s that built forty-six public parks in twenty-four states on 397,000 acres ( 1,606.6 km2 ) , chiefly near urban areas in the United States . The NPS used labor from a variety of Great Depression federal relief programs , chiefly the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration , to build recreational demonstration areas . By the end of World War II , the recreational demonstration areas had all either become National Park Service units or been given to their states for use as state parks . The goals of the Recreation Demonstration Area program were typically threefold : 1 ) to develop land as a park ; 2 ) to provide employment ; and 3 ) to create new parks near urban areas . For the first goal , in some cases the land developed was purchased from sub-optimal farmers , providing some of the poorest farmers with relief . In other cases , state lands ( in state forests or parks ) were developed . In the second case , the CCC and WPA laborers received payment , and in the CCC , room and board . Finally , the residents of nearby urban areas benefited from new nearby recreation areas .",
