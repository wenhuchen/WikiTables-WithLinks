  "/wiki/Mississippi's_2nd_congressional_district": "Mississippi 's 2nd congressional district ( MS-2 ) covers much of Western Mississippi . It includes most of Jackson , the riverfront cities of Greenville and Vicksburg and the interior market cities of Clarksdale , Greenwood and Clinton . The district is approximately 275 miles ( 443 km ) long , 180 miles ( 290 km ) wide and borders the Mississippi River ; it encompasses much of the Mississippi Delta , and a total of 15 counties and parts of several others . It is the only majority-black district in the state . The district is home to four of Mississippi 's eight public four-year colleges and universities : Alcorn State University in Lorman ; Delta State University in Cleveland ; Jackson State University in Jackson ; and Mississippi Valley State University in Itta Bena , a few miles west of Greenwood . All except Delta State are HBCUs and are members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference . From statehood to the election of 1846 , Mississippi elected representatives at-large statewide on a general ticket . This favored candidates who could command a majority of the voters , then consisting mostly of white men of property . Following Reconstruction , the Democratic Party regained control of the state legislature and worked to reduce Republican voting strength in the state . It redefined congressional districts , creating a 'shoestring ' congressional district running the length of the Mississippi River and taking in the black-majority ( then Republican ) areas of the Mississippi Delta . By this gerrymandering , they created five other districts with white majorities . Election campaigns were often accompanied by fraud and violence as Democrats tried to reduce black Republican voting .",

  "/wiki/South_Carolina's_4th_congressional_district": "The 4th Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in upstate South Carolina bordering North Carolina . It includes parts of Greenville and Spartanburg counties . The district is characterized by the two major cities of Greenville and Spartanburg . The district is the state 's wealthiest district and one of its most conservative . In the late 20th century , it has been in Republican hands since 1979 , aside from a six-year stint by Democrat Liz J. Patterson , the daughter of former Senator Olin Johnston . Even before the Republicans finally took control of the seat , the 4th had been a rather conservative district . Like in most of the state , the old-line Southern Democrats began splitting their tickets as early as the 1940s . However , this area 's white conservatives became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and local level as early as the 1970s , well before the rest of the state swung Republican . The district is a major destination for presidential candidates in election years , as South Carolina is one of the first states to hold a presidential primary . Republican William Timmons has represented the district since January 3 , 2019 . He succeeded Republican Trey Gowdy who did not seek reelection .",
