Directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis , Neal Purvis and Robert Wade , it is a direct sequel to Casino Royale , and the second film to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond . The film also stars Olga Kurylenko , Mathieu Amalric , Gemma Arterton , Jeffrey Wright , and Judi Dench . In the film , Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover , Vesper Lynd , and is assisted by Camille Montes , who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family . The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman Dominic Greene , a member of the Quantum organisation , who intends to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat in Bolivia to seize control of their water supply . Producer Michael G. Wilson developed the film 's plot while the previous film in the series , Casino Royale , was being shot . Purvis , Wade , and Haggis contributed to the script . Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the screenwriter strike , they received no such credits in the final cut . The title was chosen from a 1959 short story in Ian Fleming 's For Your Eyes Only , though the film does not contain any elements of that story . Location filming took place in Mexico , Panama , Chile , Italy , Austria and Wales , while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios . Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs : a vintage Douglas DC-3 was used for a flight sequence , and Dennis Gassner 's set designs are reminiscent of Ken Adam 's work on several early Bond films . Taking a course away from the usual Bond villains , Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film 's contemporary villains .",

The project resurfaced in 1985 , when producer Elliott Kastner brought the book to Parker 's attention . Parker began work on a new script , and in doing so , made several changes from Hjortsberg 's novel . The independent film studio Carolco Pictures produced Angel Heart with a budget of $ 18 million . Principal photography commenced in March 1986 and concluded in June of that year ; filming took place on location in New York and New Orleans . Before its release , Angel Heart faced censorship issues from the Motion Picture Association of America for one scene of sexual content . Parker was forced to remove ten seconds of footage to avoid an X rating and secure the R rating that the film 's distributor Tri-Star Pictures wanted . An unrated version featuring the removed footage was later released on home video .",
