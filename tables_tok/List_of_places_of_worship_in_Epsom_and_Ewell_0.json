        "Justin Alleyn designed Ewell 's Catholic church in 1962 , but Catholic worship in the town predates this by 25 years : St Matthias ' Church at Worcester Park founded a mission church in 1937 . A parish was created in 1941 . A landmark on the A240 Kingston Road because of its slim brick-built campanile , the brick and concrete church 's walls have an imaginative zigzag design with east-facing stained glass in each section . The interior layout was altered in 2003",

  "intro": "As of 2020, there are 29 churches and other places of worship in the borough of Epsom and Ewell, one of 11 local government districts in the English county of Surrey. Another four buildings were formerly used for worship but are now in alternative uses. Census statistics show that the majority of the borough's 75,000 residents are Christian, and most places of worship belong to Christian denominations. There are significant minorities of Muslims and Hindus as well, and these groups each have one venue for their worship. Many churches and chapels date from the 20th century - a period of rapid population growth in the area, which is just outside London - but the towns of Ewell and Epsom are older and have parish churches with ancient origins. English Heritage has awarded listed status to four places of worship in the borough of Epsom and Ewell. A building is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status. Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of exceptional interest; Grade II* is used for particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of special interest. As of February 2001, there were no Grade I-listed buildings, 15 with Grade II* status and 307 Grade II-listed buildings in the borough. The borough council also maintains a list of locally listed buildings, of which there are 65 as of 2020."
