He became nationally known for filing charges against House majority leader Tom DeLay in September 2005 for conspiring to violate Texas ' election law and/or to launder money . Earle prosecuted other politicians , including Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and State Representative Mike Martin , as well as Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox on charges of commercial bribery . His cases against Hutchinson and DeLay were unsuccessful ; Hutchinson was found not guilty and DeLay 's conviction was overturned on appeal about three years after the conviction . Earle 's only success was with Mike Martin , although the felony perjury charge was reduced to a misdemeanor after a plea bargain . In 1985 , as Travis County District Attorney , he accused then-Attorney General Jim Mattox of threatening Fulbright & Jaworski 's municipal bond business unless one of their lawyers stopped trying to question his sister , Janice Mattox , about a bank loan . The loan was an issue in a lawsuit involving Mobil Oil Co. and Clinton Manges , a South Texas oil man and rancher who financially supported Mattox , who was acquitted after a long trial . On one occasion , Earle prosecuted himself for an election law violation after missing a campaign finance filing deadline by one day ; he was fined $ 212 .",

  "/wiki/Jack_Abramoff_scandals": "The federal investigations into Jack Abramoff and his political and business dealings are among the broadest and most extensive in American political history , [ citation needed ] involving well over a dozen offices of the FBI and over 100 FBI agents tasked exclusively to the investigation . [ citation needed ] Given the extent and complexity of the suspected corruption , an entire inter-governmental task force , involving many federal governmental departments and agencies , has been established to aid the federal investigation . [ citation needed ] The U.S. Justice Department has announced that it will not reveal the details of the investigation , or who specifically has been targeted for investigation until indictments are issued . Under his plea agreements , Abramoff is required to answer all questions by federal investigators and prosecutors . The investigations led to several plea agreements by those involved , including Congressman Bob Ney ( R-OH ) . Abramoff himself also pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges , including tax fraud and bribing public officials . Abramoff 's activities also became an issue for many Democratic candidates in the November 2006 House and Senate elections , as many challengers painted the incumbent Republican Congress as corrupted by Abramoff and his powerful allies . On March 29 , 2006 , he was sentenced to five years and ten months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of more than $ 21 million . As a result of Abramoff 's criminal behavior , prominent politicians with close ties to Abramoff as well as hundreds of Congressional politicians who have received money from his clients ( see the monetary influence of Jack Abramoff ) came under media scrutiny ( with some even donating the money to charity ) , with lobbying reform proposals presented by both parties . In September 2006 both the Senate and House passed bills and rules changes to make public earmarks but not make other substantive lobbying reforms .",
