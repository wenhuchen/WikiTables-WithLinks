  "/wiki/Chait\u00e9n_(volcano)": "Chait\u00e9n is a volcanic caldera 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) in diameter , 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) west of the elongated ice-capped Michinmahuida volcano and 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) northeast of the town of Chait\u00e9n , near the Gulf of Corcovado in southern Chile . The most recent eruptive phase of the volcano erupted on 2008 . Originally , radiocarbon dating of older tephra from the volcano suggested that its last previous eruption was in 7420 BC \u00b1 75 years . However , recent studies have found that the volcano is more active than thought . According to the Global Volcanism Program , its last eruption was in 2011 . The caldera rim reaches 1,122 metres ( 3,681 ft ) above sea level . Before the current eruption , it was mostly filled by a rhyolite obsidian lava dome that reached a height of 962 metres ( 3,156 ft ) , partly devoid of vegetation . Two small lakes occupied the caldera floor on the west and north sides of the lava dome . The translucent grey obsidian which had erupted from the volcano was used by pre-Columbian cultures as a raw material for artifacts and has been found as far away as 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) to the south and north , for example in Chan-Chan .",

It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) of Antarctica under the Chilean Antarctic Territory . [ nb 3 ] , The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper and lithium . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil .",

Ciomadul consists of several lava domes with two embedded explosion craters known as Mohos and St. Ana , the latter of which contains a crater lake , Lake Sf\u00e2nta Ana . The dominant volcanic rock at Ciomadul is potassium-rich dacite . Volcanic activity at Ciomadul commenced with effusive activity about one million years ago . Most of the volcano was constructed between 650,000 - 500,000 years ago . Between 56,000 and 32,000 years ago explosive volcanic activity occurred at Ciomadul . Both the exact dates of the various eruptions and of the formation of the St. Ana and Mohos craters are unclear , partly because dates obtained by potassium-argon dating and other dating techniques deviate from each other . Some eruptions may have reached sub-Plinian strength , ejecting volcanic ash as far as the Black Sea . The last eruption took place between 32,600 and 27,500 years ago .

In volcanology this group is known as the Puyehue-Cord\u00f3n Caulle Volcanic Complex ( PCCVC ) . Four volcanoes constitute the volcanic group or complex , the Cordillera Nevada caldera , the Pliocene Mencheca volcano , Cord\u00f3n Caulle fissure vents and the Puyehue stratovolcano . Like most stratovolcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt , Puyehue and Cord\u00f3n Caulle are along the intersection of a traverse fracture with the larger north-south Liqui\u00f1e-Ofqui Fault . The volcanic complex has shaped the local landscape and produced a huge variety of volcanic landforms and products over the last 300,000 years . Cinder cones , lava domes , calderas and craters can be found in the area apart from the widest variety of volcanic rocks in all the Southern Zone , for example both primitive basalts and rhyolites . Cord\u00f3n Caulle erupted shortly after the 1960 Valdivia earthquake , the largest recorded earthquake in history . Apart from this , the Puyehue-Cord\u00f3n Caulle area is one of the main sites of exploration for geothermal power in Chile . Geothermal activity is manifested on the surface of Puyehue and Cord\u00f3n Caulle as several boiling springs , solfataras and fumaroles .

The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields , mountains , and glaciers , and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands . Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate , despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle . Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly , with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate . According to the ancient manuscript Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k , the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island . In the following centuries , Norwegians , and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians , emigrated to Iceland , bringing with them thralls ( i.e. , slaves or serfs ) of Gaelic origin . The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies .

Iceland is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world , with eruptions occurring on average roughly every three years ( in the 20th century there were 39 volcanic eruptions on and around Iceland ) . [ citation needed ] About a third of the basaltic lavas erupted in recorded history have been produced by Icelandic eruptions . Notable eruptions have included that of Eldgj\u00e1 , a fissure of Katla , in 934 ( the world 's largest basaltic eruption ever witnessed ) , Laki in 1783 ( the world 's second largest ) , and several eruptions beneath ice caps , which have generated devastating glacial bursts , most recently in 2010 after the eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull . Iceland 's location astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , where the Eurasian and North American Plates are moving apart , is partly responsible for this intense volcanic activity , but an additional cause is necessary to explain why Iceland is a substantial island while the rest of the ridge mostly consists of seamounts , with peaks below sea level . As well as being a region of higher temperature than the surrounding mantle , it is believed to have a higher concentration of water .

It supports many flora and fauna among its diverse habitats , which are subject to frequent snowfall and reach high elevations . A lava dome , Lassen Peak has a volume of 0.6 cubic miles ( 2.5 km3 ) making it the largest lava dome on Earth . The volcano arose from the destroyed northern flank of now-collapsed Brokeoff Volcano about 27,000 years ago , from a series of eruptions over the course of a few years . The mountain has been significantly eroded by glaciers over the last 25,000 years , and is now covered in talus deposits .

The arc formed due to subduction along the Cascadia subduction zone . Although taking its name from the Cascade Range , this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one , and the Cascade Volcanoes extend north into the Coast Mountains , past the Fraser River which is the northward limit of the Cascade Range proper . Some of the major cities along the length of the arc include Portland , Seattle , and Vancouver , and the population in the region exceeds 10 million . All could be potentially affected by volcanic activity and great subduction-zone earthquakes along the arc . Because the population of the Pacific Northwest is rapidly increasing , the Cascade volcanoes are some of the most dangerous , due to their eruptive history and potential for future eruptions , and because they are underlain by weak , hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks that are susceptible to failure . Consequently , Mount Rainier is one of the Decade Volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth 's Interior ( IAVCEI ) as being worthy of particular study , due to the danger it poses to Seattle and Tacoma .

  "/wiki/Sunda_Arc": "The Sunda Arc is a volcanic arc that produced the islands of Sumatra and Java , the Sunda Strait and the Lesser Sunda Islands . A chain of volcanoes forms the topographic spine of these islands . The Sunda Arc marks an active convergent boundary between the East Eurasian plates that underlie Indonesia , especially the Sunda Plate and the Burma Plate , with the India and Australian Plates that form the seabed of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal . The Sunda Arc is a classic example of a volcanic island arc , in which all the elements of such geodynamic features can be identified . The India and Australian Plates are subducting beneath the Sunda and Burma plates along the Sunda Arc . The tectonic deformation along this subduction zone in the Java Trench ( also known as the Sunda Trench ) caused the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake of 26 December , 2004 .",
  "/wiki/Nea_Kameni": "Nea Kameni is a small uninhabited Greek island of volcanic origin located in the Aegean Sea , within the flooded Santorini caldera . Nea Kameni and the neighbouring small island Palea Kameni ( the new and old burnt islands ) have formed over the past two millennia through repeated eruptions of dacite lava and ash . The Roman historian Cassius Dio records in the year 47 CE This year a small islet , hitherto unknown , made an appearance close to the island of Thera . Cassius 's report may refer to Palaia Kameni . Pliny the Elder reports a new island emerging during on July 8 , in the year of the consulship of M. Junius Silanus and L. Balbus , thus 19 CE . Major eruptions over the past 300 years took place in 1707-1712 , 1866-1870 , 1925-1928 , and 1939-1941 . The last small eruption happened in 1950 and involved lava dome extrusion . Nea Kameni is nearly round , and has a diameter of approximately 2 kilometers and an area of 3.4 km2 . It is monitored closely by scientists from the Institute for the Study and Monitoring of the Santorini Volcano ( ISMOSAV ) , and is a protected scientific site . The island has many active sulfur vents , as well as a carpet of red grassy succulents on the thin soil in the summertime . The nearly barren island is visited daily by dozens of tourist boats throughout the summer . Visitors climb a gravel path to reach the top of the 130-meter-high volcanic crater , where it is possible to complete a full circuit of the rim .",

An exclave of the U.S. , it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast has a maritime border with Russia 's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west . To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean , while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest . Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world . It is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state , but by far the continent 's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel , with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015 - more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland . Approximately half of Alaska 's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area . The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area , comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware . Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans . The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing the colony of Alaska that spanned most of the current state . The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for $ 7.2 million , or approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) .

With an estimated population of around 17.2 million , it is the most populous country in Central America . Guatemala is a representative democracy ; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n , also known as Guatemala City . The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Maya civilization , which extended across Mesoamerica . Most of the country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century , becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain . Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , which dissolved by 1841 . From the mid- to late-19th century , Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife . Beginning in the early 20th century , it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the United Fruit Company and the United States government . In 1944 , the authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup , initiating a decade-long revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms . A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship . From 1960 to 1996 , Guatemala endured a bloody civil war fought between the US-backed government and leftist rebels , including genocidal massacres of the Maya population perpetrated by the military .

The volcano is located in the Cascade Range and is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , a segment of the Pacific Ring of Fire that includes over 160 active volcanoes . This volcano is well known for its ash explosions and pyroclastic flows . Mount St. Helens is most notorious for its major eruption on May 18 , 1980 , the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history . Fifty-seven people were killed ; 250 homes , 47 bridges , 15 miles ( 24 km ) of railways , and 185 miles ( 298 km ) of highway were destroyed . A massive debris avalanche , triggered by an earthquake of magnitude 5.1 , caused a lateral eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain 's summit from 9,677 ft ( 2,950 m ) to 8,363 ft ( 2,549 m ) , leaving a 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) wide horseshoe-shaped crater . The debris avalanche was up to 0.7 cubic miles ( 2.9 km3 ) in volume . The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was created to preserve the volcano and allow for the eruption 's aftermath to be scientifically studied .

  "/wiki/Miocene": "The Miocene ( /\u02c8ma\u026a.\u0259\u02ccsi\u02d0n , \u02c8ma\u026a.o\u028a-/ MY-\u0259-seen , MY-oh- ) is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago ( Ma ) . The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell ; its name comes from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ( mei\u014dn , less ) and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ( kainos , new ) and means less recent because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene . The Miocene is preceded by the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene . As the earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene , the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages . The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regionally defined boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch . The apes first evolved , arose , and diversified during the early Miocene ( Aquitanian and Burdigalian stages ) , becoming widespread in the Old World . By the end of this epoch and the start of the following one , the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path during the final Messinian stage ( 7.5-5.3 Ma ) of the Miocene . As in the Oligocene before it , grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent . In the seas of the Miocene , kelp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of Earth 's most productive ecosystems . The plants and animals of the Miocene were recognizably modern . Mammals and birds were well-established . Whales , pinnipeds , and kelp spread .",
  "/wiki/Valles_Caldera": "Valles Caldera ( or Jemez Caldera ) is a 13.7-mile ( 22.0 km ) wide extinct volcanic caldera in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico . Hot springs , streams , fumaroles , natural gas seeps and volcanic domes dot the caldera floor landscape . The highest point in the caldera is Redondo Peak , an 11,253-foot ( 3,430 m ) resurgent lava dome located entirely within the caldera . Also within the caldera are several grass valleys , or valles , the largest of which is Valle Grande ( locally /\u02c8va\u026a.e\u026a \u02c8\u0261r\u0251\u02d0nde\u026a/ VY-ay GRAHN-day ) , the only one accessible by a paved road . Much of the caldera is within the Valles Caldera National Preserve , a unit of the National Park System . In 1975 , Valles Caldera was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service .",
  "/wiki/Jemez_Mountains": "The Jemez Mountains ( [ \u02e1h\u025bm\u025bz ] ) are a volcanic group of mountains in Rio Arriba , Sandoval , and Los Alamos counties , New Mexico , United States . Numerous Puebloan Indian tribes have lived in the Jemez Mountains region since before the Spanish arrived in New Mexico . The Pueblo Indians of this region are the Towa-speaking Jemez people for which this mountain range is named , the Keres-speaking Keresan Indians , and the Tewa-speaking Tewa Indians . Ts\u0105mpiye'ip'\u012fn is the Tewa language name for the Jemez Mountains . The highest point in the range is Chicoma Mountain ( also spelled as Tschicoma or Tchicoma ) at an elevation of 11,561 feet ( 3524 meters ) . The town of Los Alamos and Los Alamos National Laboratory adjoin the eastern side of the range while the town of Jemez Springs is to the west . Pajarito Mountain Ski Area is the only ski area in the Jemez . New Mexico State Highway 4 is the primary road that provides vehicular access to locations in the Jemez Mountains .",
  "/wiki/Before_Present": "Before Present ( BP ) years is a time scale used mainly in archaeology , geology and other scientific disciplines to specify when events occurred in the past . Because the present time changes , standard practice is to use 1 January 1950 as the commencement date ( epoch ) of the age scale , [ a ] reflecting the origin of practical radiocarbon dating in the 1950s . The abbreviation BP has been interpreted retrospectively as Before Physics ; that refers to the time before nuclear weapons testing artificially altered the proportion of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere , making dating after that time likely to be unreliable . In a convention that is not always observed , many sources restrict the use of BP dates to those produced with radiocarbon dating ; the alternative notation RCYBP is explicitly Radio Carbon Years Before Present ."
