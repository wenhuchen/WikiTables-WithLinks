He is often described as a polymath , and in mathematics as The Last Universalist , since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime . As a mathematician and physicist , he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics , mathematical physics , and celestial mechanics . In his research on the three-body problem , Poincar\u00e9 became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory . He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology . Poincar\u00e9 made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations , and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form . Poincar\u00e9 discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905 . Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell 's equations , an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity . In 1905 , Poincar\u00e9 first proposed gravitational waves ( ondes gravifiques ) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations . The Poincar\u00e9 group used in physics and mathematics was named after him . Early in the 20th century he formulated the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture that became over time one of the famous unsolved problems in mathematics until it was solved in 2002-2003 by Grigori Perelman .",

[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",
  "/wiki/Pure_mathematics": "Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independently of any application outside mathematics . These concepts may originate in real-world concerns , and the results obtained may later turn out to be useful for practical applications , but pure mathematicians are not primarily motivated by such applications . Instead , the appeal is attributed to the intellectual challenge and aesthetic beauty of working out the logical consequences of basic principles . While pure mathematics has existed as an activity since at least Ancient Greece , the concept was elaborated upon around the year 1900 , after the introduction of theories with counter-intuitive properties ( such as non-Euclidean geometries and Cantor 's theory of infinite sets ) , and the discovery of apparent paradoxes ( such as continuous functions that are nowhere differentiable , and Russell 's paradox ) . This introduced the need of renewing the concept of mathematical rigor and rewriting all mathematics accordingly , with a systematic use of axiomatic methods . This led many mathematicians to focus on mathematics for its own sake , that is , pure mathematics . Nevertheless , almost all mathematical theories remained motivated by problems coming from the real world or from less abstract mathematical theories . Also , many mathematical theories , which had seemed to be totally pure mathematics , were eventually used in applied areas , mainly physics and computer science . A famous early example is Isaac Newton 's demonstration that his law of universal gravitation implied that planets move in orbits that are conic sections , geometrical curves that had been studied in antiquity by Apollonius . Another example is the problem of factoring large integers , which is the basis of the RSA cryptosystem , widely used to secure internet communications . It follows that , presently , the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a philosophical point of view or a mathematician 's preference than a rigid subdivision of mathematics . In particular , it is not uncommon that some members of a department of applied mathematics describe themselves as pure mathematicians .",
  "/wiki/Applied_mathematics": "Applied mathematics is the application of mathematical methods by different fields such as science , engineering , business , computer science , and industry . Thus , applied mathematics is a combination of mathematical science and specialized knowledge . The term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models . In the past , practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories , which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake . The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics .",

The three-body problem is a special case of the n-body problem . Unlike two-body problems , no general closed-form solution exists , as the resulting dynamical system is chaotic for most initial conditions , and numerical methods are generally required . Historically , the first specific three-body problem to receive extended study was the one involving the Moon , the Earth , and the Sun . In an extended modern sense , a three-body problem is any problem in classical mechanics or quantum mechanics that models the motion of three particles .",
  "/wiki/Chaos_theory": "Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the study of chaos - states of dynamical systems whose apparently-random states of disorder and irregularities are often governed by deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions . Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory stating that , within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems , there are underlying patterns , interconnectedness , constant feedback loops , repetition , self-similarity , fractals , and self-organization . The butterfly effect , an underlying principle of chaos , describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state ( meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions ) . A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in Texas . Small differences in initial conditions , such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation , can yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems , rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general . This can happen even though these systems are deterministic , meaning that their future behavior follows a unique evolution and is fully determined by their initial conditions , with no random elements involved . In other words , the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable . This behavior is known as deterministic chaos , or simply chaos .

  "/wiki/Topology": "In mathematics , topology ( from the Greek \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 , 'place ' , and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 , 'study ' ) is concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations , such as stretching , twisting , crumpling and bending , but not tearing or gluing . A topological space is a set endowed with a structure , called a topology , which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces , and , more generally , all kinds of continuity . Euclidean spaces , and , more generally , metric spaces are examples of a topological space , as any distance or metric defines a topology . The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies . A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property . Basic examples of topological properties are : the dimension , which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface ; compactness , which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle ; connectedness , which allows distinguishing a circle from two non-intersecting circles . The ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Leibniz , who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs and analysis situs . Leonhard Euler 's Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field 's first theorems . The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century , although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed .",

February 19 ] 1845 - January 6 , 1918 ) was a German mathematician . He created set theory , which has become a fundamental theory in mathematics . Cantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets , defined infinite and well-ordered sets , and proved that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers . In fact , Cantor 's method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an infinity of infinities . He defined the cardinal and ordinal numbers and their arithmetic . Cantor 's work is of great philosophical interest , a fact he was well aware of . Cantor 's theory of transfinite numbers was originally regarded as so counter-intuitive - even shocking - that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincar\u00e9 and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer , while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections . Cantor , a devout Lutheran , believed the theory had been communicated to him by God . Some Christian theologians ( particularly neo-Scholastics ) saw Cantor 's work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God - on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism - a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected . The objections to Cantor 's work were occasionally fierce : Leopold Kronecker 's public opposition and personal attacks included describing Cantor as a scientific charlatan , a renegade and a corrupter of youth . Kronecker objected to Cantor 's proofs that the algebraic numbers are countable , and that the transcendental numbers are uncountable , results now included in a standard mathematics curriculum .",

  "/wiki/Set_theory": "Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets , which informally are collections of objects . Although any type of object can be collected into a set , set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics . The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all mathematical objects . The modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s . After the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory , such as Russell 's paradox , numerous axiom systems were proposed in the early twentieth century , of which the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms , with or without the axiom of choice , are the best-known . Set theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for mathematics , particularly in the form of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice . Beyond its foundational role , set theory is a branch of mathematics in its own right , with an active research community . Contemporary research into set theory includes a diverse collection of topics , ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals .",
  "/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics": "Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics , or , in a broader sense , the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics . In this latter sense , the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague . Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts ( set , function , geometrical figure , number , etc . ) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts , especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics ( formulas , theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas , definitions , proofs , algorithms , etc . ) also called metamathematical concepts , with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics . The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics ; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges . The foundations of mathematics as a whole does not aim to contain the foundations of every mathematical topic . Generally , the foundations of a field of study refers to a more-or-less systematic analysis of its most basic or fundamental concepts , its conceptual unity and its natural ordering or hierarchy of concepts , which may help to connect it with the rest of human knowledge . The development , emergence and clarification of the foundations can come late in the history of a field , and may not be viewed by everyone as its most interesting part . Mathematics always played a special role in scientific thought , serving since ancient times as a model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry , and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences ( especially physics ) . Mathematics ' many developments towards higher abstractions in the 19th century brought new challenges and paradoxes , urging for a deeper and more systematic examination of the nature and criteria of mathematical truth , as well as a unification of the diverse branches of mathematics into a coherent whole . The systematic search for the foundations of mathematics started at the end of the 19th century and formed a new mathematical discipline called mathematical logic , with strong links to theoretical computer science .",

There are no unpaired elements . In mathematical terms , a bijective function f : X \u2192 Y is a one-to-one ( injective ) and onto ( surjective ) mapping of a set X to a set Y .

  "/wiki/Well-order": "In mathematics , a well-order ( or well-ordering or well-order relation ) on a set S is a total order on S with the property that every non-empty subset of S has a least element in this ordering . The set S together with the well-order relation is then called a well-ordered set . In some academic articles and textbooks these terms are instead written as wellorder , wellordered , and wellordering or well order , well ordered , and well ordering . Every non-empty well-ordered set has a least element . Every element s of a well-ordered set , except a possible greatest element , has a unique successor ( next element ) , namely the least element of the subset of all elements greater than s. There may be elements besides the least element which have no predecessor ( see Natural numbers below for an example ) . In a well-ordered set S , every subset T which has an upper bound has a least upper bound , namely the least element of the subset of all upper bounds of T in S. If \u2264 is a non-strict well ordering , then < is a strict well ordering . A relation is a strict well ordering if and only if it is a well-founded strict total order . The distinction between strict and non-strict well orders is often ignored since they are easily interconvertible . Every well-ordered set is uniquely order isomorphic to a unique ordinal number , called the order type of the well-ordered set . The well-ordering theorem , which is equivalent to the axiom of choice , states that every set can be well ordered . If a set is well ordered ( or even if it merely admits a well-founded relation ) , the proof technique of transfinite induction can be used to prove that a given statement is true for all elements of the set . The observation that the natural numbers are well ordered by the usual less-than relation is commonly called the well-ordering principle ( for natural numbers ) .",
  "/wiki/Real_number": "In mathematics , a real number is a value of a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line . The adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by Ren\u00e9 Descartes , who distinguished between real and imaginary roots of polynomials . The real numbers include all the rational numbers , such as the integer \u22125 and the fraction 4/3 , and all the irrational numbers , such as \u221a2 ( 1.41421356. , the square root of 2 , an irrational algebraic number ) . Included within the irrationals are the transcendental numbers , such as \u03c0 ( 3.14159265. ) . In addition to measuring distance , real numbers can be used to measure quantities such as time , mass , energy , velocity , and many more . Real numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line , where the points corresponding to integers are equally spaced . Any real number can be determined by a possibly infinite decimal representation , such as that of 8.632 , where each consecutive digit is measured in units one tenth the size of the previous one . The real line can be thought of as a part of the complex plane , and complex numbers include real numbers .",
  "/wiki/Natural_number": "In mathematics , the natural numbers are those used for counting ( as in there are six coins on the table ) and ordering ( as in this is the third largest city in the country ) . In common mathematical terminology , words colloquially used for counting are cardinal numbers and words connected to ordering represent ordinal numbers . The natural numbers can , at times , appear as a convenient set of codes ( labels or names ) ; that is , as what linguists call nominal numbers , forgoing many or all of the properties of being a number in a mathematical sense . Some definitions , including the standard ISO 80000-2 , begin the natural numbers with 0 , corresponding to the non-negative integers 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 , whereas others start with 1 , corresponding to the positive integers 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 , while others acknowledge both definitions . Texts that exclude zero from the natural numbers sometimes refer to the natural numbers together with zero as the whole numbers , but in other writings , that term is used instead for the integers ( including negative integers ) . The natural numbers are a basis from which many other number sets may be built by extension : the integers ( Grothendieck group ) , by including ( if not yet in ) the neutral element 0 and an additive inverse ( \u2212n ) for each nonzero natural number n ; the rational numbers , by including a multiplicative inverse ( 1/n ) for each nonzero integer n ( and also the product of these inverses by integers ) ; the real numbers by including with the rationals the limits of ( converging ) Cauchy sequences of rationals ; the complex numbers , by including with the real numbers the unresolved square root of minus one ( and also the sums and products thereof ) ; and so on . These chains of extensions make the natural numbers canonically embedded ( identified ) in the other number systems . Properties of the natural numbers , such as divisibility and the distribution of prime numbers , are studied in number theory . Problems concerning counting and ordering , such as partitioning and enumerations , are studied in combinatorics . In common language , for example in primary school , natural numbers may be called counting numbers both to intuitively exclude the negative integers and zero , and also to contrast the discreteness of counting to the continuity of measurement , established by the real numbers .",

The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number : the number of elements in the set . The transfinite cardinal numbers describe the sizes of infinite sets . Cardinality is defined in terms of bijective functions . Two sets have the same cardinality if , and only if , there is a one-to-one correspondence ( bijection ) between the elements of the two sets . In the case of finite sets , this agrees with the intuitive notion of size . In the case of infinite sets , the behavior is more complex . A fundamental theorem due to Georg Cantor shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities , and in particular the cardinality of the set of real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the set of natural numbers . It is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set , something that can not happen with proper subsets of finite sets . There is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers :",

A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer . Geometry arose independently in a number of early cultures as a practical way for dealing with lengths , areas , and volumes . Geometry began to see elements of formal mathematical science emerging in Greek mathematics as early as the 6th century BC . By the 3rd century BC , geometry was put into an axiomatic form by Euclid , whose treatment , Euclid 's Elements , set a standard for many centuries to follow . Geometry arose independently in India , with texts providing rules for geometric constructions appearing as early as the 3rd century BC . Islamic scientists preserved Greek ideas and expanded on them during the Middle Ages . By the early 17th century , geometry had been put on a solid analytic footing by mathematicians such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Pierre de Fermat . Since then , and into modern times , geometry has expanded into non-Euclidean geometry and manifolds , describing spaces that lie beyond the normal range of human experience . While geometry has evolved significantly throughout the years , there are some general concepts that are fundamental to geometry .

In its most general form , algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols ; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics . It includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups , rings , and fields . The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra ; the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra . Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics , science , or engineering , as well as such applications as medicine and economics . Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics , studied primarily by professional mathematicians . Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions , such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values . For example , in x + 2 = 5 { \\displaystyle x+2=5 } the letter x { \\displaystyle x } is unknown , but applying additive inverses can reveal its value : x = 3 { \\displaystyle x=3 } . In E = mc2 , the letters E { \\displaystyle E } and m { \\displaystyle m } are variables , and the letter c { \\displaystyle c } is a constant , the speed of light in a vacuum .

  "/wiki/Number_theory": "Number theory ( or arithmetic or higher arithmetic in older usage ) is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions .

Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers ( for example , rational numbers ) or defined as generalizations of the integers ( for example , algebraic integers ) . Number theory seeks to understand the properties of integer systems in spite of their apparent complexity . Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations ( Diophantine geometry ) . Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects ( for example , the Riemann zeta function ) that encode properties of the integers , primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion ( analytic number theory ) . One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers , for example , as approximated by the latter ( Diophantine approximation ) . The older term for number theory is arithmetic . By the early twentieth century , it had been superseded by number theory .

Lie 's original motivation for introducing Lie groups was to model the continuous symmetries of differential equations , in much the same way that finite groups are used in Galois theory to model the discrete symmetries of algebraic equations .",
  "/wiki/Knot_theory": "In topology , knot theory is the study of mathematical knots . While inspired by knots which appear in daily life , such as those in shoelaces and rope , a mathematical knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it can not be undone , the simplest knot being a ring ( or unknot ) . In mathematical language , a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space , R3 ( in topology , a circle is n't bound to the classical geometric concept , but to all of its homeomorphisms ) . Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself ( known as an ambient isotopy ) ; these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself . Knots can be described in various ways . Given a method of description , however , there may be more than one description that represents the same knot . For example , a common method of describing a knot is a planar diagram called a knot diagram . Any given knot can be drawn in many different ways using a knot diagram . Therefore , a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot . A complete algorithmic solution to this problem exists , which has unknown complexity . In practice , knots are often distinguished by using a knot invariant , a quantity which is the same when computed from different descriptions of a knot . Important invariants include knot polynomials , knot groups , and hyperbolic invariants .",

  "/wiki/Algebraic_geometry": "Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics , classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials . Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques , mainly from commutative algebra , for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros . The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties , which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations . Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are : plane algebraic curves , which include lines , circles , parabolas , ellipses , hyperbolas , cubic curves like elliptic curves , and quartic curves like lemniscates and Cassini ovals . A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation . Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points , the inflection points and the points at infinity . More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations . Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis , topology and number theory . Initially a study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables , the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off , and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations , than to find a specific solution ; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics , both conceptually and in terms of technique . In the 20th century , algebraic geometry split into several subareas .",

A special case is ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) , which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives . PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as sound , heat , diffusion , electrostatics , electrodynamics , fluid dynamics , elasticity , gravitation and quantum mechanics . These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs . Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional dynamical systems , partial differential equations often model multidimensional systems . PDEs find their generalisation in stochastic partial differential equations .",
  "/wiki/Soliton": "In mathematics and physics , a soliton or solitary wave is a self-reinforcing wave packet that maintains its shape while it propagates at a constant velocity . Solitons are caused by a cancellation of nonlinear and dispersive effects in the medium .

The soliton phenomenon was first described in 1834 by John Scott Russell ( 1808-1882 ) who observed a solitary wave in the Union Canal in Scotland . He reproduced the phenomenon in a wave tank and named it the Wave of Translation .",

The theory of modular forms therefore belongs to complex analysis but the main importance of the theory has traditionally been in its connections with number theory . Modular forms appear in other areas , such as algebraic topology , sphere packing , and string theory . A modular function is a function that , like a modular form , is invariant with respect to the modular group , but without the condition that f ( z ) be holomorphic in the upper half-plane . Instead , modular functions are meromorphic . Modular form theory is a special case of the more general theory of automorphic forms , and therefore can now be seen as just the most concrete part of a rich theory of discrete groups .",

  "/wiki/Differential_equation": "In mathematics , a differential equation is an equation that relates one or more functions and their derivatives . In applications , the functions generally represent physical quantities , the derivatives represent their rates of change , and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two . Because such relations are extremely common , differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering , physics , economics , and biology . The study of differential equations consists mainly of the study of their solutions ( the set of functions that satisfy the equation ) , and of the properties of their solutions . Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas ; however , many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without computing them exactly . If a closed-form expression for the solutions is not available , the solutions may be numerically approximated using computers . The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations , while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy .",
  "/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces": "In mathematics , the differential geometry of surfaces deals with the differential geometry of smooth surfaces with various additional structures , most often , a Riemannian metric . Surfaces have been extensively studied from various perspectives : extrinsically , relating to their embedding in Euclidean space and intrinsically , reflecting their properties determined solely by the distance within the surface as measured along curves on the surface . One of the fundamental concepts investigated is the Gaussian curvature , first studied in depth by Carl Friedrich Gauss , who showed that curvature was an intrinsic property of a surface , independent of its isometric embedding in Euclidean space . Surfaces naturally arise as graphs of functions of a pair of variables , and sometimes appear in parametric form or as loci associated to space curves . An important role in their study has been played by Lie groups ( in the spirit of the Erlangen program ) , namely the symmetry groups of the Euclidean plane , the sphere and the hyperbolic plane . These Lie groups can be used to describe surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature ; they also provide an essential ingredient in the modern approach to intrinsic differential geometry through connections . On the other hand , extrinsic properties relying on an embedding of a surface in Euclidean space have also been extensively studied . This is well illustrated by the non-linear Euler-Lagrange equations in the calculus of variations : although Euler developed the one variable equations to understand geodesics , defined independently of an embedding , one of Lagrange 's main applications of the two variable equations was to minimal surfaces , a concept that can only be defined in terms of an embedding .",

  "/wiki/Enumerative_combinatorics": "Enumerative combinatorics is an area of combinatorics that deals with the number of ways that certain patterns can be formed . Two examples of this type of problem are counting combinations and counting permutations . More generally , given an infinite collection of finite sets Si indexed by the natural numbers , enumerative combinatorics seeks to describe a counting function which counts the number of objects in Sn for each n. Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem , many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description . The twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations , combinations and partitions . The simplest such functions are closed formulas , which can be expressed as a composition of elementary functions such as factorials , powers , and so on . For instance , as shown below , the number of different possible orderings of a deck of n cards is f ( n ) = n ! . The problem of finding a closed formula is known as algebraic enumeration , and frequently involves deriving a recurrence relation or generating function and using this to arrive at the desired closed form . Often , a complicated closed formula yields little insight into the behavior of the counting function as the number of counted objects grows . In these cases , a simple asymptotic approximation may be preferable . A function g ( n ) { \\displaystyle g ( n ) } is an asymptotic approximation to f ( n ) { \\displaystyle f ( n ) } if f ( n ) / g ( n ) \u2192 1 { \\displaystyle f ( n ) /g ( n ) \\rightarrow 1 } as n \u2192 \u221e { \\displaystyle n\\rightarrow \\infty } .

  "/wiki/Absolute_differential_calculus": "In mathematics , Ricci calculus constitutes the rules of index notation and manipulation for tensors and tensor fields . It is also the modern name for what used to be called the absolute differential calculus ( the foundation of tensor calculus ) , developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro in 1887-1896 , and subsequently popularized in a paper written with his pupil Tullio Levi-Civita in 1900 . Jan Arnoldus Schouten developed the modern notation and formalism for this mathematical framework , and made contributions to the theory , during its applications to general relativity and differential geometry in the early twentieth century . A component of a tensor is a real number that is used as a coefficient of a basis element for the tensor space . The tensor is the sum of its components multiplied by their corresponding basis elements . Tensors and tensor fields can be expressed in terms of their components , and operations on tensors and tensor fields can be expressed in terms of operations on their components . The description of tensor fields and operations on them in terms of their components is the focus of the Ricci calculus . This notation allows an efficient expression of such tensor fields and operations . While much of the notation may be applied with any tensors , operations relating to a differential structure are only applicable to tensor fields . Where needed , the notation extends to components of non-tensors , particularly multidimensional arrays . A tensor may be expressed as a linear sum of the tensor product of vector and covector basis elements . The resulting tensor components are labelled by indices of the basis .",

  "/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead": "Alfred North Whitehead OM FRS FBA ( 15 February 1861 - 30 December 1947 ) was an English mathematician and philosopher . He is best known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as process philosophy , which today has found application to a wide variety of disciplines , including ecology , theology , education , physics , biology , economics , and psychology , among other areas . In his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics , logic , and physics . His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume Principia Mathematica ( 1910-1913 ) , which he wrote with former student Bertrand Russell . Principia Mathematica is considered one of the twentieth century 's most important works in mathematical logic , and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by Modern Library . Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s , Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science , and finally to metaphysics . He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy . Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects , and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes , thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another . Today Whitehead 's philosophical works - particularly Process and Reality - are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy . Whitehead 's process philosophy argues that there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts , so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us . For this reason , one of the most promising applications of Whitehead 's thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization and environmental ethics pioneered by John B. Cobb .",
  "/wiki/Logic": "Logic ( from the Ancient Greek : \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae , romanized : logik\u1e17 ) is the systematic study of the forms of inference , the relations that lead to the acceptance of one proposition , the conclusion , on the basis of a set of other propositions , the premises . More broadly , logic is the analysis and appraisal of arguments . The premises may or may not support the conclusion ; when they do not , the relation is characterized as a fallacy . In ordinary discourse , inferences may be signified by words such as therefore , thus , hence , ergo , and so on . There is no universal agreement as to the exact definition and boundaries of logic , and this is why the issue still remains one of the main subjects of research and debates in the field of philosophy of logic ( see \u00a7 Rival conceptions , below ) . However , it has traditionally included the classification of arguments , the systematic exposition of the logical forms , the validity and soundness of deductive reasoning , the strength of inductive reasoning , the study of proof and inference ( including paradoxes and fallacies ) , and the study of syntax and semantics . Historically , logic has been studied in philosophy ( since ancient times ) and mathematics ( since the mid-19th century ) .

  "/wiki/Philosophy_of_science": "Philosophy of science is a sub-field of philosophy concerned with the foundations , methods , and implications of science . The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science , the reliability of scientific theories , and the ultimate purpose of science .

Philosophy of science focuses on metaphysical , epistemic and semantic aspects of science . Ethical issues such as bioethics and scientific misconduct are often considered ethics or science studies rather than philosophy of science . There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science , including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all . In addition to these general questions about science as a whole , philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences ( such as biology or physics ) . Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself . While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of Aristotle , philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the logical positivist movement , which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements ' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them . Charles Sanders Peirce and Karl Popper moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology . Thomas Kuhn 's 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was also formative , challenging the view of scientific progress as steady , cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a paradigm , the set of questions , concepts , and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period .

From 1930 until his death 70 years later , Quine was continually affiliated with Harvard University in one way or another , first as a student , then as a professor of philosophy and a teacher of logic and set theory , and finally as a professor emeritus who published or revised several books in retirement . He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978 . A 2009 poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries . He won the first Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy in 1993 for his systematical and penetrating discussions of how learning of language and communication are based on socially available evidence and of the consequences of this for theories on knowledge and linguistic meaning . In 1996 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for his outstanding contributions to the progress of philosophy in the 20th century by proposing numerous theories based on keen insights in logic , epistemology , philosophy of science and philosophy of language . Quine falls squarely into the analytic philosophy tradition while also being the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not conceptual analysis but the abstract branch of the empirical sciences . His major writings include Two Dogmas of Empiricism ( 1951 ) , which attacked the traditional analytic-synthetic distinction between propositions and advocated a form of semantic holism , and Word and Object ( 1960 ) , which further developed these positions and introduced Quine 's famous indeterminacy of translation thesis , advocating a behaviorist theory of meaning . He also developed an influential naturalized epistemology that tried to provide an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input . He is also important in philosophy of science for his systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science . This led to his famous quip that philosophy of science is philosophy enough . In philosophy of mathematics , he and his Harvard colleague Hilary Putnam developed the Quine-Putnam indispensability thesis , an argument for the reality of mathematical entities .",

In 1925-27 , it appeared in a second edition with an important Introduction to the Second Edition , an Appendix A that replaced \u27389 and all-new Appendix B and Appendix C. PM is not to be confused with Russell 's 1903 The Principles of Mathematics . PM was originally conceived as a sequel volume to Russell 's 1903 Principles , but as PM states , this became an unworkable suggestion for practical and philosophical reasons : The present work was originally intended by us to be comprised in a second volume of Principles of Mathematics . But as we advanced , it became increasingly evident that the subject is a very much larger one than we had supposed ; moreover on many fundamental questions which had been left obscure and doubtful in the former work , we have now arrived at what we believe to be satisfactory solutions . PM , according to its introduction , had three aims : ( 1 ) to analyze to the greatest possible extent the ideas and methods of mathematical logic and to minimize the number of primitive notions and axioms , and inference rules ; ( 2 ) to precisely express mathematical propositions in symbolic logic using the most convenient notation that precise expression allows ; ( 3 ) to solve the paradoxes that plagued logic and set theory at the turn of the 20th-century , like Russell 's paradox . This third aim motivated the adoption of the theory of types in PM . The theory of types adopts grammatical restrictions on formulas that rules out the unrestricted comprehension of classes , properties , and functions . The effect of this is that formulas such as would allow the comprehension of objects like the Russell set turn out to be ill-formed : they violate the grammatical restrictions of the system of PM . There is no doubt that PM is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy : as Irvine has noted , it sparked interest in symbolic logic and advanced the subject by popularizing it ; it showcased the powers and capacities of symbolic logic ; and it showed how advances in philosophy of mathematics and symbolic logic could go hand-in-hand with tremendous fruitfulness . Indeed , PM was in part brought about by an interest in logicism , the view on which all mathematical truths are logical truths . It was in part thanks to the advances made in PM that , despite its defects , numerous advances in meta-logic were made , including G\u00f6del 's incompleteness theorems . For all that , PM is not widely used today : probably the foremost reason for this is its reputation for typographical complexity .",

  "/wiki/Measure_theory": "In mathematical analysis , a measure on a set is a systematic way to assign a number to each suitable subset of that set , intuitively interpreted as its size . In this sense , a measure is a generalization of the concepts of length , area , and volume . A particularly important example is the Lebesgue measure on a Euclidean space , which assigns the conventional length , area , and volume of Euclidean geometry to suitable subsets of the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn . For instance , the Lebesgue measure of the interval [ 0 , 1 ] in the real numbers is its length in the everyday sense of the word , specifically , 1 . Technically , a measure is a function that assigns a non-negative real number or +\u221e to ( certain ) subsets of a set X ( see Definition below ) . It must further be countably additive : the measure of a 'large ' subset that can be decomposed into a finite ( or countably infinite ) number of 'smaller ' disjoint subsets is equal to the sum of the measures of the smaller subsets . In general , if one wants to associate a consistent size to each subset of a given set while satisfying the other axioms of a measure , one only finds trivial examples like the counting measure . This problem was resolved by defining measure only on a sub-collection of all subsets ; the so-called measurable subsets , which are required to form a \u03c3-algebra . This means that countable unions , countable intersections and complements of measurable subsets are measurable . Non-measurable sets in a Euclidean space , on which the Lebesgue measure can not be defined consistently , are necessarily complicated in the sense of being badly mixed up with their complement . Indeed , their existence is a non-trivial consequence of the axiom of choice . Measure theory was developed in successive stages during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by \u00c9mile Borel , Henri Lebesgue , Johann Radon , and Maurice Fr\u00e9chet , among others .",
  "/wiki/Fourier_series": "In mathematics , a Fourier series ( /\u02c8f\u028arie\u026a , -i\u0259r/ ) is a periodic function composed of harmonically related sinusoids , combined by a weighted summation . With appropriate weights , one cycle ( or period ) of the summation can be made to approximate an arbitrary function in that interval ( or the entire function if it too is periodic ) . As such , the summation is a synthesis of another function . The discrete-time Fourier transform is an example of Fourier series . The process of deriving the weights that describe a given function is a form of Fourier analysis . For functions on unbounded intervals , the analysis and synthesis analogies are Fourier transform and inverse transform .",
  "/wiki/Differential_calculus": "In mathematics , differential calculus is a subfield of calculus concerned with the study of the rates at which quantities change . It is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus , the other being integral calculus , the study of the area beneath a curve . The primary objects of study in differential calculus are the derivative of a function , related notions such as the differential , and their applications . The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value . The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation . Geometrically , the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point , provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point . For a real-valued function of a single real variable , the derivative of a function at a point generally determines the best linear approximation to the function at that point . Differential calculus and integral calculus are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus , which states that differentiation is the reverse process to integration . Differentiation has applications to nearly all quantitative disciplines . For example , in physics , the derivative of the displacement of a moving body with respect to time is the velocity of the body , and the derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration . The derivative of the momentum of a body with respect to time equals the force applied to the body ; rearranging this derivative statement leads to the famous F = ma equation associated with Newton 's second law of motion . The reaction rate of a chemical reaction is a derivative .",

It is useful in many branches of mathematics , including algebraic geometry , number theory , analytic combinatorics , applied mathematics ; as well as in physics , including the branches of hydrodynamics , thermodynamics , and particularly quantum mechanics . By extension , use of complex analysis also has applications in engineering fields such as nuclear , aerospace , mechanical and electrical engineering . [ citation needed ] As a differentiable function of a complex variable is equal to the sum of its Taylor series ( that is , it is analytic ) , complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable ( that is , holomorphic functions ) .",

  "/wiki/Special_functions": "Special functions are particular mathematical functions that have more or less established names and notations due to their importance in mathematical analysis , functional analysis , physics , or other applications . The term is defined by consensus , and thus lacks a general formal definition , but the List of mathematical functions contains functions that are commonly accepted as special .",
  "/wiki/Numerical_analysis": "Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation ( as opposed to symbolic manipulations ) for the problems of mathematical analysis ( as distinguished from discrete mathematics ) . Numerical analysis naturally finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences , but in the 21st century also the life sciences , social sciences , medicine , business and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations . The growth in computing power has revolutionized the use of realistic mathematical models in science and engineering , and subtle numerical analysis is required to implement these detailed models of the world . For example , ordinary differential equations appear in celestial mechanics ( predicting the motions of planets , stars and galaxies ) ; numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis ; stochastic differential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology . Before the advent of modern computers , numerical methods often depended on hand interpolation formulas applied to data from large printed tables . Since the mid 20th century , computers calculate the required functions instead , but many of the same formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms . The numerical point of view goes back to the earliest mathematical writings . A tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection ( YBC 7289 ) , gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of the square root of 2 , the length of the diagonal in a unit square . Computing the sides of a triangle in terms of square roots is a basic practical problem , for example in astronomy , carpentry , and construction . Numerical analysis continues this long tradition : rather than exact symbolic answers , which can only be applied to real-world measurements by translation into digits , it gives approximate solutions within specified error bounds .",

  "/wiki/Philosopher": "A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy . The term philosopher comes from the Ancient Greek , \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 ( philosophos ) , meaning lover of wisdom . The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras ( 6th century BC ) . In the classical sense , a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life , focusing on resolving existential questions about the human condition , and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors . Typically , these particular brands of philosophy are Hellenistic ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers . A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense , does n't know when to stop asking questions , and reexamines the old ways of thought . In a modern sense , a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy , such as aesthetics , ethics , epistemology , logic , metaphysics , social theory , and political philosophy . A philosopher may also be one who worked in the humanities or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries , such as the arts , history , economics , sociology , psychology , linguistics , anthropology , theology , and politics .",
  "/wiki/Mathematical_logic": "Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics . It bears close connections to metamathematics , the foundations of mathematics , and theoretical computer science . The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems . Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory , model theory , recursion theory , and proof theory . These areas share basic results on logic , particularly first-order logic , and definability . In computer science ( particularly in the ACM Classification ) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article ; see Logic in computer science for those . Since its inception , mathematical logic has both contributed to , and has been motivated by , the study of foundations of mathematics . This study began in the late 19th century with the development of axiomatic frameworks for geometry , arithmetic , and analysis . In the early 20th century it was shaped by David Hilbert 's program to prove the consistency of foundational theories . Results of Kurt G\u00f6del , Gerhard Gentzen , and others provided partial resolution to the program , and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency . Work in set theory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of sets , although there are some theorems that can not be proven in common axiom systems for set theory . Contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics often focuses on establishing which parts of mathematics can be formalized in particular formal systems ( as in reverse mathematics ) rather than trying to find theories in which all of mathematics can be developed .",

He also worked on wave propagation and his work on the structure of the Earth in Some Problems of Geodynamics won for him the Adams prize in 1911 when he developed a mathematical model of surface waves known as Love waves . Love also contributed to the theory of tidal locking and introduced the parameters known as Love numbers , which are widely used today . These numbers are also used in problems related to the tidal deformation of the Earth due to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun . He was educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School and in 1881 won a scholarship to St John 's College , Cambridge , where he was at first undecided whether to study classics or mathematics . His successful progress ( he was placed Second Wrangler ) vindicated his choice of mathematics , and in 1886 he was elected Fellow of the college . In 1899 he was appointed Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Oxford , a position which he retained until his death in 1940 . He was also a Fellow of Queen 's College .

  "/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)": "In physics , elasticity ( from Greek \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 ductible ) is the ability of a body to resist a distorting influence and to return to its original size and shape when that influence or force is removed . Solid objects will deform when adequate forces are applied to them . If the material is elastic , the object will return to its initial shape and size when these forces are removed . Hooke 's law states that the force should be proportional to the extension . The physical reasons for elastic behavior can be quite different for different materials . In metals , the atomic lattice changes size and shape when forces are applied ( energy is added to the system ) . When forces are removed , the lattice goes back to the original lower energy state . For rubbers and other polymers , elasticity is caused by the stretching of polymer chains when forces are applied . Perfect elasticity is an approximation of the real world . The most elastic body in modern science found is quartz fiber [ citation needed ] and phosphor bronze , but even this is not a perfect elastic body . The perfect elastic body is an ideal concept only . Most materials which possess elasticity in practice remain purely elastic only up to very small deformations .",
  "/wiki/Love_wave": "In elastodynamics , Love waves , named after Augustus Edward Hough Love , are horizontally polarized surface waves . The Love wave is a result of the interference of many shear waves ( S-waves ) guided by an elastic layer , which is welded to an elastic half space on one side while bordering a vacuum on the other side . In seismology , Love waves ( also known as Q waves ( Quer : German for lateral ) ) are surface seismic waves that cause horizontal shifting of the Earth during an earthquake . Augustus Edward Hough Love predicted the existence of Love waves mathematically in 1911 . They form a distinct class , different from other types of seismic waves , such as P-waves and S-waves ( both body waves ) , or Rayleigh waves ( another type of surface wave ) . Love waves travel with a lower velocity than P- or S- waves , but faster than Rayleigh waves . These waves are observed only when there is a low velocity layer overlying a high velocity layer/ sub-layers .",
  "/wiki/Tidal_locking": "Tidal locking ( also called gravitational locking , captured rotation and spin-orbit locking ) , in the most well-known case , occurs when an orbiting astronomical body always has the same face toward the object it is orbiting . This is known as synchronous rotation : the tidally locked body takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner . For example , the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth , although there is some variability because the Moon 's orbit is not perfectly circular . Usually , only the satellite is tidally locked to the larger body . However , if both the difference in mass between the two bodies and the distance between them are relatively small , each may be tidally locked to the other ; this is the case for Pluto and Charon . The effect arises between two bodies when their gravitational interaction slows a body 's rotation until it becomes tidally locked . Over many millions of years , the interaction forces changes to their orbits and rotation rates as a result of energy exchange and heat dissipation . When one of the bodies reaches a state where there is no longer any net change in its rotation rate over the course of a complete orbit , it is said to be tidally locked . The object tends to stay in this state when leaving it would require adding energy back into the system . The object 's orbit may migrate over time so as to undo the tidal lock , for example , if a giant planet perturbs the object . Not every case of tidal locking involves synchronous rotation . With Mercury , for example , this tidally locked planet completes three rotations for every two revolutions around the Sun , a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance .",
  "/wiki/Love_number": "The Love numbers h , k , and l are dimensionless parameters that measure the rigidity of a planetary body and the susceptibility of its shape to change in response to a tidal potential . In 1911 ( some authors have 1906 ) Augustus Edward Hough Love introduced the values h and k which characterize the overall elastic response of the Earth to the tides . Later , in 1912 , T. Shida of Japan added a third Love number , l , which was needed to obtain a complete overall description of the solid Earth 's response to the tides . The Love number h is defined as the ratio of the body tide to the height of the static equilibrium tide ; also defined as the vertical ( radial ) displacement or variation of the planet 's elastic properties . In terms of the tide generating potential V ( \u03b8 , \u03d5 ) / g { \\displaystyle V ( \\theta , \\phi ) /g } , the displacement is h V ( \u03b8 , \u03d5 ) / g { \\displaystyle hV ( \\theta , \\phi ) /g } where \u03b8 { \\displaystyle \\theta } is latitude , \u03d5 { \\displaystyle \\phi } is east longitude and g { \\displaystyle g } is acceleration due to gravity . For a hypothetical solid Earth h = 0 { \\displaystyle h=0 } . For a liquid Earth , one would expect h = 1 { \\displaystyle h=1 } . However , the deformation of the sphere causes the potential field to change , and thereby deform the sphere even more . The theoretical maximum is h = 2.5 { \\displaystyle h=2.5 } . For the real Earth , h { \\displaystyle h } lies between these values . The Love number k is defined as the cubical dilation or the ratio of the additional potential ( self-reactive force ) produced by the deformation of the deforming potential . It can be represented as k V ( \u03b8 , \u03d5 ) / g { \\displaystyle kV ( \\theta , \\phi ) /g } , where k = 0 { \\displaystyle k=0 } for a rigid body .",
