  "/wiki/OpenStreetMap": "OpenStreetMap ( OSM ) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world . The geodata underlying the map is considered the primary output of the project . The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map data across much of the world , and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices . OSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information . Created by Steve Coast in the UK in 2004 , it was inspired by the success of Wikipedia and the predominance of proprietary map data in the UK and elsewhere . Since then , it has grown to over two million registered users , who can collect data using manual survey , GPS devices , aerial photography , and other free sources . This crowdsourced data is then made available under the Open Database License . The site is supported by the OpenStreetMap Foundation , a non-profit organisation registered in England and Wales . The data from OSM can be used in various ways including production of paper maps and electronic maps ( similar to Google Maps , for example ) , geocoding of address and place names , and route planning . Prominent users include Facebook , Craigslist , Seznam , OsmAnd , Geocaching , MapQuest Open , JMP statistical software , and Foursquare . Many users of GPS devices use OSM data to replace the built-in map data on their devices . OpenStreetMap data has been favourably compared with proprietary datasources , although in 2009 data quality varied across the world .",
  "/wiki/Lattice_truss_bridge": "A lattice bridge is a form of truss bridge that uses many small , closely spaced diagonal elements forming a lattice . The lattice Truss Bridge was patented in 1820 by architect Ithiel Town . Originally a design to allow a substantial bridge to be made from planks employing lower-skilled labor , rather than heavy timbers and more expensive carpenters , this type of bridge has also been constructed using many relatively light iron or steel members . The individual elements are more easily handled by the construction workers , but the bridge also requires substantial support during construction . A simple lattice truss will transform the applied loads into a thrust , as the bridge will tend to change length under load . This is resisted by pinning the lattice members to the top and bottom chords , which are more substantial than the lattice members , but which may also be fabricated from relatively small elements rather than large beams .",
