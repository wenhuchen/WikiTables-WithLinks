  "/wiki/Mount_John_University_Observatory": "University of Canterbury Mount John Observatory ( UCMJO ) , previously known as Mt John University Observatory ( MJUO ) , is New Zealand 's premier astronomical research observatory . It is situated at 1,029 metres ( 3,376 ft ) ASL atop Mount John at the northern end of the Mackenzie Basin in the South Island , and was established in 1965 . There are many telescopes on site including : one 0.4-meter , two 0.6-meter , one 1.0-meter , and a new 1.8-meter MOA Telescope ( see details below ) . The nearest population center is the resort town Lake Tekapo ( pop . < 500 ) . Approximately 20% of nights at MJUO are photometric , with a larger number available for spectroscopic work and direct imaging photometry . UCMJO is operated by the University of Canterbury , and is the home of HERCULES ( High Efficiency and Resolution Canterbury University Large Echelle Spectrograph ) , and the observational wing of the Japanese/New Zealand MOA collaboration ( Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics ) led by Professor Yasushi Muraki of Nagoya University . A Japanese funded , 1.8-meter telescope is now in place and will be used initially by the MOA Project , before handover to the University of Canterbury at the conclusion of the MOA Project in 2012 . In June 2012 an area of 430,000 hectares ( 1,700 sq mi ) around the observatory was declared as the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve by the International Dark-Sky Association , one of only four such reserves around the world . The area has a Bortle Scale of 2 .",
  "/wiki/Kitt_Peak": "Kitt Peak ( O'odham : Ioligam ) is a mountain in the U.S. state of Arizona , and at 6,883 feet ( 2,098 m ) is the highest point in the Quinlan Mountains . It is the location of the Kitt Peak National Observatory . The radio telescope at the Observatory is one of ten dishes comprising the Very Long Baseline Array radio telescope . The peak was named in English by County Surveyor George J. Roskruge for his sister , Phillippa , who was the wife of William F. Kitt . On his 1893 Pima County Survey map , Roskruge spelled the name 'Kits ' . At the request of the wife of George F. Kitt , the spelling was changed by decision in 1930 . Kitt Peak is the second-highest peak on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation , and as such is the second-most sacred after Baboquivari Peak . Near the summit is I'itoi 's Garden , the summer residence of the nation 's elder brother deity . The name Ioligam means red stick in reference to the abundance of manzanita bushes on and around the mountain .",
