  "/wiki/List_of_first_overall_NBA_draft_picks": "The National Basketball Association 's first overall pick is the player who is selected first among all eligible draftees by a team during the annual National Basketball Association ( NBA ) draft . The first pick is awarded to the team that wins the NBA draft lottery ; in most cases , that team had a losing record in the previous season . The team with the first pick attracts significant media attention , as does the player who is selected with that pick . Eleven first picks have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award : Oscar Robertson , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ( record six-time winner ) , Bill Walton , Magic Johnson ( three-time winner ) , Hakeem Olajuwon , David Robinson , Shaquille O'Neal , Allen Iverson , Tim Duncan ( two-time winner ) , LeBron James ( four-time winner ) , and Derrick Rose ( youngest winner ) . Since the advent of the draft lottery in 1985 , eight number one overall picks have won an NBA title . They are David Robinson , Shaquille O'Neal , Hakeem Olajuwon , Glenn Robinson , Tim Duncan , LeBron James , Andrew Bogut , and Kyrie Irving . China 's Yao Ming ( 2002 ) and Italy 's Andrea Bargnani ( 2006 ) are the only two players without competitive experience in the United States to be drafted first overall . Eleven other international players with U.S. college experience have been drafted first overall - Mychal Thompson ( Bahamas ) in 1978 , Hakeem Olajuwon ( Nigeria ) in 1984 , Patrick Ewing ( Jamaica ) in 1985 , Tim Duncan ( U.S. Virgin Islands ) in 1997 , Michael Olowokandi ( Nigeria ) in 1998 , Andrew Bogut ( Australia ) in 2005 , Kyrie Irving ( Australia ) in 2011 , Anthony Bennett ( Canada ) in 2013 , Andrew Wiggins ( Canada ) in 2014 , Ben Simmons ( Australia ) in 2016 , and Deandre Ayton ( Bahamas ) in 2018 . Duncan is an American citizen , but is considered an international player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or the District of Columbia . Ewing had dual Jamaican-American citizenship when he was drafted and Irving and Simmons had dual Australian-American citizenship when they were drafted . Note that the drafts between 1947 and 1949 were held by the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) .

The franchise saw limited success on the court in its six years in San Diego despite the acquisition of star center Bill Walton , who missed nearly three full seasons due to injury upon his arrival . In 1981 , the franchise was acquired by Los Angeles-based real estate mogul Donald Sterling . In 1984 , the franchise was controversially relocated to Los Angeles by Sterling without the approval of the NBA . Despite fines and a lawsuit brought on against franchise ownership by the NBA seeking to return the franchise to San Diego , the team was ultimately permitted to remain in Los Angeles , where they failed to see significant regular season or playoff success .
