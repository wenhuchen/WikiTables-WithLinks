  "/wiki/Sports_radio": "Sports radio ( or sports talk radio ) is a radio format devoted entirely to discussion and broadcasting of sporting events . A widespread programming genre that has a narrow audience appeal , sports radio is characterized by an often-boisterous on-air style and extensive debate and analysis by both hosts and callers . Many sports talk stations also carry play-by-play ( live commentary ) of local sports teams as part of their regular programming . Hosted by Bill Mazer , the first sports talk radio show in history launched in March 1964 on New York 's WNBC ( AM ) . Soon after WNBC launched its program , in 1965 Seton Hall University 's radio station , WSOU , started Hall Line , a call-in sports radio talk show focusing on the team 's basketball program . Having celebrated its 50th anniversary on air during the 2015-2016 season , Hall Line , which broadcasts to central and northern New Jersey as well as all five boroughs of New York , is the oldest and longest running sports talk call-in show in the NY-NJ Metropolitan area , and is believed to be the oldest in the nation .

ER had two channels , one for talk and a second for updates and play-by-play . ER 's talk lineup included current New York Yankees voice John Sterling , New York Mets radio host Ed Coleman and former big-league pitcher Bill Denehy .

In contrast , Canadian sports talk stations may carry a national brand ( such as TSN Radio or Sportsnet Radio ) but carry mostly local programming , with American-based shows filling in gaps .",
