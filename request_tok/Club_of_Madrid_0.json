  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis ) .",

The People 's Party was a re-foundation in 1989 of the People 's Alliance ( AP ) , a party led and founded by Manuel Fraga Iribarne , a former Minister of the Interior and Minister of Tourism during Francisco Franco 's dictatorship .

The PP is a member of the center-right European People 's Party ( EPP ) , and in the European Parliament its 16 MEPs sit in the EPP Group . The PP is also a member of the Centrist Democrat International and the International Democrat Union . The PP was also one of the founding organizations of the Budapest-based Robert Schuman Institute for Developing Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe . On 24 May 2018 , the National Court found that the PP profited from the illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme of the G\u00fcrtel case , confirming the existence of an illegal accounting and financing structure that ran in parallel with the party 's official one since the party 's foundation in 1989 and ruling that the PP helped establish a genuine and effective system of institutional corruption through the manipulation of central , autonomous and local public procurement . This prompted a no confidence vote on Mariano Rajoy 's government , which was brought down on 1 June 2018 in the first successful motion since the Spanish transition to democracy .

The party is currently led by Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re . The Labour Party is officially committed to social democratic ideals . Its slogan since the 1930s has been everyone shall take part , and the party traditionally seeks a strong welfare state , funded through taxes and duties . Since the 1980s , the party has included more of the principles of a social market economy in its policy , allowing for privatisation of state-owned assets and services and reducing income tax progressivity , following the wave of economic liberalisation during the 1980s . During the first Stoltenberg government , the party 's policies were inspired by Tony Blair 's New Labour agenda in the United Kingdom and saw the most widespread privatisation by any Norwegian government to that date . The party has frequently been described as increasingly neoliberal since the 1980s , both by political scientists and opponents on the left . The Labour Party profiles itself as a progressive party that subscribes to co-operation on a national as well as international level . Its youth wing is the Workers ' Youth League . The party is a member of the Party of European Socialists and Progressive Alliance . The Labour Party has always been a strong supporter of Norwegian NATO membership and has supported Norway joining the European Union during two referendums .",

  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada": "The prime minister of Canada ( French : premier ministre du Canada ) is the primary Minister of the Crown , chair of the Cabinet , and Canada 's head of government . The current , and 23rd , prime minister of Canada is the Liberal Party 's Justin Trudeau , following the 2019 Canadian federal election . Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable ( French : Le Tr\u00e8s Honorable ) , a privilege maintained for life . The prime minister of Canada is in charge of the Prime Minister 's Office . The prime minister also chooses the ministers who make up the Cabinet . The two groups , with the authority of the Parliament of Canada , manage the Government of Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces . The Cabinet and the prime minister also appoint members of the Senate of Canada , the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada and other federal courts , and the leaders and boards , as required under law , of various Crown Corporations , and selects the governor general of Canada . Under the Canadian constitution , all of the power to exercise these activities is actually vested in the monarch of Canada , but in practice the monarch ( who is the head of state ) or her representative , the governor general of Canada , approves them routinely , and their role is largely ceremonial , and their powers are only exercised under the advice of the prime minister . Not outlined in any constitutional document , the office exists only as per long-established convention ( originating in Canada 's former colonial power , the United Kingdom ) that stipulates the monarch 's representative , the governor general , must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber .
