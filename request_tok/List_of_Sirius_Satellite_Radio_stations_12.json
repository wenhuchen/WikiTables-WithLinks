  "/wiki/Politics": "Politics is the set of activities that are associated with the governance of a country , state or an area . It involves making decisions that apply to groups of members . It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance - organized control over a human community , particularly a state . The academic study focusing on just politics , which is therefore more targeted than general political science , is sometimes referred to as politology ( not to be confused with politicology , a synonym for political science ) . In modern nation-states , people often form political parties to represent their ideas . Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders . An election is usually a competition between different parties . Some examples of political parties worldwide are : the African National Congress ( ANC ) in South Africa , the Democratic Party ( D ) in the United States , the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom , the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) in Germany and the Indian National Congress in India which has the highest number of political parties in the world ( 2546 political parties ) . Politics is a multifaceted word . It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental ( such as the art or science of government and political principles ) , but does often colloquially carry a negative connotation . The word has been used negatively for many years : the British national anthem as published in 1745 calls on God to Confound their politics , and the phrase play politics , for example , has been in use since at least 1853 , when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared : We do not play politics ; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us . A variety of methods are deployed in politics , which include promoting one 's own political views among people , negotiation with other political subjects , making laws , and exercising force , including warfare against adversaries .",

  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further .
