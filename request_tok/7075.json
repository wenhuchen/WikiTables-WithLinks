  "/wiki/Dune_(1984_film)": "Dune is a 1984 American epic science fiction adventure film written and directed by David Lynch and based on the 1965 Frank Herbert novel of the same name . The film stars Kyle MacLachlan ( in his film debut ) as young nobleman Paul Atreides , and includes an ensemble of well-known American and European actors in supporting roles . It was filmed at the Churubusco Studios in Mexico City and included a soundtrack by the rock band Toto , as well as Brian Eno . Set in the distant future , the film chronicles the conflict between rival noble families as they battle for control of the extremely harsh desert planet Arrakis , also known as Dune . The planet is the only source of the drug melange - also called the spice - which allows prescience and is vital to space travel , making it the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe . Paul Atreides is the scion and heir of a powerful noble family , whose inheritance of control over Arrakis brings them into conflict with its former overlords , House Harkonnen . Paul is also a candidate for the Kwisatz Haderach , a messianic figure in the Bene Gesserit religion . Besides MacLachlan , the film features a large ensemble cast of supporting actors , including Patrick Stewart , Brad Dourif , Dean Stockwell , Virginia Madsen , Jos\u00e9 Ferrer , Sting , Linda Hunt , and Max von Sydow , among others . After the novel 's initial success , attempts to adapt Dune as a film began in 1971 . A lengthy process of development followed throughout the 1970s , during which Arthur P. Jacobs , Alejandro Jodorowsky , and Ridley Scott unsuccessfully tried to bring their visions to the screen . In 1981 , executive producer Dino De Laurentiis hired Lynch as director . The film was a box-office failure , grossing $ 30.9 million from a $ 40 million budget , and was negatively reviewed by critics , which heavily criticized the screenwriting , lack of faith to the material source , the pacing , direction and editing although the visual effects , musical score , acting and action sequences were praised .",
  "/wiki/Paul_Atreides": "Paul Atreides ( /\u0259\u02c8tre\u026adi\u02d0z/ ; later known as Paul Muad'Dib ) is a fictional character in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert . Paul is a prominent character in the first two novels in the series , Dune ( 1965 ) and Dune Messiah ( 1969 ) , and returns in Children of Dune ( 1976 ) . The character is brought back as two different gholas in the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson novels which conclude the original series , Hunters of Dune ( 2006 ) and Sandworms of Dune ( 2007 ) , and appears in the prequels Paul of Dune ( 2008 ) and The Winds of Dune ( 2009 ) . According to Brian Herbert , Frank Herbert 's son and biographer , House Atreides was based on the heroic but ill-fated Greek mythological House Atreus . A primary theme of Dune and its sequels is Frank Herbert 's warning about society 's tendencies to give over every decision-making capacity to a charismatic leader . He said in 1979 , The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is : beware of heroes . Much better rely on your own judgment , and your own mistakes . Paul rises to leadership through military strategy and political maneuvering , but his superhuman powers and ability to fit himself into pre-existing religious infrastructure allow him to force himself upon mankind as their messiah . As Muad'Dib , Paul becomes the central figure of a new religion , and reluctantly unleashes a bloody jihad in his name across the universe ; Paul struggles with the potential idea of seizing divine control over his newly minted empire , only to finally escape from the burden of his destiny by placing it on his sister Alia and his offspring Leto II and Ghanima . Paul was portrayed by Kyle MacLachlan in David Lynch 's 1984 film adaptation , and by Alec Newman in the 2000 Dune miniseries and its 2003 sequel . The character will be played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in the 2020 Denis Villeneuve film Dune .",
  "/wiki/Blue_Velvet_(film)": "Blue Velvet is a 1986 American neo-noir mystery film written and directed by David Lynch . Blending psychological horror with film noir , the film stars Kyle MacLachlan , Isabella Rossellini , Dennis Hopper , and Laura Dern , and is named after Bobby Vinton 's 1963 song of the same name . The film concerns a young college student who , returning home to visit his ill father , discovers a severed human ear in a field that leads to his uncovering a vast criminal conspiracy and entering a romantic relationship with a troubled lounge singer . The screenplay of Blue Velvet had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and early 1980s , with several major studios declining it due to its strong sexual and violent content . After the failure of his 1984 film Dune , Lynch made attempts at developing a more personal story , somewhat characteristic of the surrealist style displayed in his first film Eraserhead ( 1977 ) . The independent studio De Laurentiis Entertainment Group , owned at the time by Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis , agreed to finance and produce the film . Blue Velvet initially received a divided critical response , with many stating that its objectionable content served little artistic purpose . Nevertheless , the film earned Lynch his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director , and came to achieve cult status . As an example of a director casting against the norm , it was credited for re-launching Hopper 's career and for providing Rossellini with a dramatic outlet beyond her previous work as a fashion model and a cosmetics spokeswoman . In the years since , the film has generated significant attention for its thematic symbolism , and is now widely regarded as one of Lynch 's major works and one of the greatest films of the 1980s . Publications including Sight & Sound , Time , Entertainment Weekly and BBC Magazine have ranked it among the greatest American films of all time . In 2008 , it was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the greatest American mystery films ever made .",

  "/wiki/Showgirls": "Showgirls is a 1995 erotic drama film written by Joe Eszterhas and directed by Paul Verhoeven . It stars former teen actress Elizabeth Berkley , Kyle MacLachlan , and Gina Gershon . The film centers on a street-smart drifter who ventures to Las Vegas and climbs the seedy hierarchy from stripper to showgirl . Produced on a then-sizable budget of approximately $ 45 million , significant controversy and hype surrounding the film 's amounts of sex and nudity preceded its theatrical release . In the United States , the film was rated NC-17 for nudity and erotic sexuality throughout , some graphic language , and sexual violence . Showgirls was the first ( and to date only ) NC-17 rated film to be given a wide release in mainstream theaters . Distributor United Artists dispatched several hundred staffers to theaters across North America playing Showgirls to ensure that patrons would not sneak into the theater from other films , and to make sure film-goers were over the age of 17 . Audience restriction due to the NC-17 rating coupled with poor reviews resulted in the film becoming a box office bomb , grossing just $ 37 million . Despite a negative theatrical and critical consensus , Showgirls enjoyed success on the home video market , generating more than $ 100 million from video rentals , allowing the film to turn a profit and become one of MGM 's top 20 all-time bestsellers . For its video premiere , Verhoeven prepared an R-rated cut for rental outlets that would not carry NC-17 films . This edited version runs 3 minutes shorter ( 128 minutes ) and deletes some of the more graphic footage . Despite being consistently ranked as one of the worst films ever made , Showgirls has become regarded as a cult classic , was released on Blu-ray in June 2010 and has even been subject to critical re-evaluation , with some notable directors and critics declaring it a serious satire worthy of praise .",
