[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

He was born and raised in Alton , Illinois , a suburb of St. Louis , Missouri . Wadlow reached 8 ft 11.1 in ( 2.72 m ) in height and weighed 439 lb ( 199 kg ) at his death at age 22 . His great size and his continued growth in adulthood were due to hyperplasia of his pituitary gland , which results in an abnormally high level of human growth hormone ( HGH ) .

  "/wiki/Ankylosis": "Ankylosis is a stiffness of a joint due to abnormal adhesion and rigidity of the bones of the joint , which may be the result of injury or disease . The rigidity may be complete or partial and may be due to inflammation of the tendinous or muscular structures outside the joint or of the tissues of the joint itself . When the structures outside the joint are affected , the term false ankylosis has been used in contradistinction to true ankylosis , in which the disease is within the joint . When inflammation has caused the joint-ends of the bones to be fused together , the ankylosis is termed osseous or complete and is an instance of synostosis . Excision of a completely ankylosed shoulder or elbow may restore free mobility and usefulness to the limb . Ankylosis is also used as an anatomical term , bones being said to ankylose ( or anchylose ) when , from being originally distinct , they coalesce , or become so joined together that no motion can take place between them . The term is from Greek \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 , bent , crooked .",

Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles , the third-largest in Europe , and the twentieth-largest on Earth . Geopolitically , Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland ( officially named Ireland ) , which covers five-sixths of the island , and Northern Ireland , which is part of the United Kingdom .

The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature . Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages . Today , woodland makes up about 10% of the island , compared with a European average of over 33% , and most of it is non-native conifer plantations . There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland .

The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",
