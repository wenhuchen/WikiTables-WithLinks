It is a member of the Koreanic language family and is the official and national language of both Koreas : North Korea and South Korea , with different standardized official forms used in each country . It is a recognised minority language in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County of Jilin province , China . It is also spoken in parts of Sakhalin , Russia , and Central Asia . Historical and modern linguists classify Korean as a language isolate ; however , it does have a few extinct relatives , which together with Korean itself and the Jeju language ( spoken in the Jeju Province and considered somewhat distinct ) form the Koreanic language family . The linguistic homeland of Korean is suggested to be somewhere in Manchuria .",
  "/wiki/Korean_romanization": "Romanization of Korean refers to systems for representing the Korean language in the Latin script . Korea 's alphabetic script , called Hangul , has historically been used in conjunction with Hanja ( Chinese characters ) , though such practice has become infrequent . Romaja literally means Roman letters in Korean , and refers to the Latin script . Romaja is not to be confused with romanization . The former can be applied to any use of the Latin script in Korean text - whether for Korean or non-Korean words or names - while the latter refers to writing Korean words using the Latin script : either romanizing individual words in a Korean text , or writing an entire Korean text in the Latin script .",
