The capital is Sucre , while the seat of government and financial center is located in La Paz . The largest city and principal industrial center is Santa Cruz de la Sierra , located on the Llanos Orientales ( tropical lowlands ) , a mostly flat region in the east of the country . The sovereign state of Bolivia is a constitutionally unitary state , divided into nine departments . Its geography varies from the peaks of the Andes in the West , to the Eastern Lowlands , situated within the Amazon Basin . It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil , to the southeast by Paraguay , to the south by Argentina , to the southwest by Chile , and to the northwest by Peru . One-third of the country is within the Andean mountain range . With 1,098,581 km2 ( 424,164 sq mi ) of area , Bolivia is the fifth largest country in South America , after Brazil , Argentina , Peru and Colombia ( and alongside Paraguay , one of the only two landlocked countries in the Americas ) , the 27th largest in the world , the largest landlocked country in the Southern Hemisphere and the world 's seventh largest landlocked country , after Kazakhstan , Mongolia , Chad , Niger , Mali and Ethiopia . The country 's population , estimated at 11 million , is multiethnic , including Amerindians , Mestizos , Europeans , Asians and Africans . Spanish is the official and predominant language , although 36 indigenous languages also have official status , of which the most commonly spoken are Guarani , Aymara and Quechua languages . Before Spanish colonization , the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the Inca Empire , while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes . Spanish conquistadors arriving from Cuzco and Asunci\u00f3n took control of the region in the 16th century .",
  "/wiki/Coropuna": "Coropuna is a dormant compound volcano located in the Andes mountains of southeast-central Peru whose upper reaches consist of several perennially snowbound conical summits . The complex extends over an area of 240 square kilometres ( 92.6 square miles ) , its highest summit reaching an altitude of 6,377 metres ( 20,922 feet ) above sea level . Its thick ice cap is the most extensive in Earth 's tropical zone , with several outlet glaciers . Below an elevation of five kilometres ( 3.1 miles ) , there are various vegetation belts which include trees , peat bogs , grasses and also agricultural areas and pastures . Coropuna consists of stratovolcanos . These are composed chiefly of ignimbrites [ a ] and lava flows on a basement formed by earlier ignimbrites and lava flows . The Coropuna complex has been active for at least five million years , with the bulk of the current cone having been formed during the Quaternary . [ b ] Coropuna has had two or three Holocene eruptions 2,100 \u00b1 200 and either 1,100 \u00b1 100 or 700 \u00b1 200 years ago which generated lava flows , plus an additional eruption which may have taken place some 6,000 years ago . Current activity occurs exclusively in the form of hot springs . Coropuna is 150 kilometres ( 93 miles ) from the city of Arequipa . People have lived on Coropuna for millennia . The mountain was regarded as sacred by the Inca and several archaeological sites have been discovered there , including the Inca sites of Maucallacta and Acchaymarca .",

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river . At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent . Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017 .",
  "/wiki/Aucanquilcha": "Aucanquilcha ( pronounced : OW-kahn-KEEL-chuh ) is a massive stratovolcano located in the Antofagasta Region of northern Chile , just west of the border with Bolivia and within the Alto Loa National Reserve . Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , the stratovolcano has the form of a ridge with a maximum height of 6,176 metres ( 20,262 ft ) . The volcano is embedded in a larger cluster of volcanoes known as the Aucanquilcha cluster . This cluster of volcanoes was formed in stages over eleven million years of activity with varying magma output , including lava domes and lava flows . Aucanquilcha volcano proper is formed from four units that erupted between 1.04-0.23 million years ago . During the ice ages , both the principal Aucanquilcha complex and the other volcanoes of the cluster were subject to glaciation , resulting in the formation of moraines and cirques . The cluster has generated lava ranging in composition from andesite to dacite , with the main volcano being exclusively of dacitic composition . Systematic variations in temperature , crystal and biotite content have been recorded during the evolution of the cluster . At Aucanquilcha volcano there is some fumarolic activity , and sulfur deposits are found at the summit . Several sulfur mines lie in the complex . One mine at an altitude of 5,950 metres ( 19,520 ft ) was opened in 1913 and remained in use from 1950 to 1992 . It was the world 's highest mine during that period .",

It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) of Antarctica under the Chilean Antarctic Territory . [ nb 3 ] , The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper and lithium . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil .",

  "/wiki/San_Pedro_(Chile_volcano)": "San Pedro is a Holocene composite volcano in northern Chile and one of the tallest active volcanoes in the world . Part of the Chilean Andes ' volcanic segment , it is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , one of the four tracts of the Andean Volcanic Belt . This region of volcanism includes the world 's two highest volcanoes Ojos del Salado and Llullaillaco . San Pedro , like other Andean volcanoes , was formed by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate . It has a neighbouring volcano , San Pablo , and is itself formed by two separate edifices usually known as the Old Cone and the Young Cone . These edifices are formed by rocks ranging from basaltic andesite over andesite to dacite and are emplaced on a basement formed by Miocene volcanic rocks . The Old Cone was active over one hundred thousand years ago and was eventually truncated by a giant landslide that removed its northwestern side . Within the landslide scar lava flows and pyroclastic flows constructed the Young Cone as well as the lateral centre La Poru\u00f1a . This volcano was glaciated during the Pleistocene and a large Plinian eruption occurred at the beginning of the Holocene . Some eruptions reportedly occurred during historical time ; presently the volcano is fumarolically active .",
  "/wiki/Ampato": "Ampato ( possibly from Quechua hamp'atu or from Aymara jamp'atu , both meaning frog ) is a dormant 6,288-metre ( 20,630 ft ) stratovolcano in the Andes of southern Peru . It lies about 70-75 kilometres ( 43-47 mi ) northwest of Arequipa and is part of a north-south chain that includes the volcanoes Hualca Hualca and Sabancaya , the last of which has been active in historical time . Ampato consists of three volcanic cones , which lie on top of an older eroded volcanic edifice . They were formed sequentially by extrusion of lava flows , but Ampato has also had explosive eruptions which have deposited ash , lapilli and pumice in the surrounding landscape . One young lava flow has been dated to 17,000 \u00b1 6,000 years before present , but a summit lava dome is even younger , and Holocene ash layers in surrounding peat bogs may testify to the occurrence of recent eruptions . The present-day volcano is covered by an ice cap , and during the last glacial maximum glaciers advanced to low altitudes . In 1995 , an Inca mummy known as Mummy Juanita was discovered on Ampato by Johan Reinhard ; it had been offered as a human sacrifice more than six hundred years earlier on the mountain .",
  "/wiki/Parinacota_Volcano": "Parinacota ( in Hispanicized spelling ) , Parina Quta or Parinaquta is a dormant stratovolcano on the border of Chile and Bolivia . Together with Pomerape it forms the Nevados de Payachata volcanic chain .

The symmetrical cone is capped by a summit crater with widths of 1 kilometre ( 0.62 mi ) or 500 metres ( 1,600 ft ) . Farther down on the southern slopes lie three parasitic centres known as the Ajata cones . These cones have generated lava flows . The volcano overlies a platform formed by lava domes and andesitic lava flows . The volcano started growing during the Pleistocene and formed a large cone . At some point between the Pleistocene and the Holocene , the western flank of the volcano collapsed , generating a giant landslide that spread west and formed a large , hummocky landslide deposit . The avalanche crossed and dammed a previously existing drainage , impounding or enlarging Lake Chungar\u00e1 ; numerous other lakes now forming the headwaters of the Rio Lauca sprang up within the deposit . Volcanic activity rebuilt the cone after the collapse , cancelling out the collapse scar . Parinacota had numerous effusive and explosive eruptions during the Holocene , the latest about 200 years ago .",

Tacora itself is a stratovolcano with a caldera and a crater . The youngest radiometric age is 50,000 years ago and it is heavily eroded by glacial activity . Volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone results from the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate . Tacora is constructed on the so-called Arica Altiplano and is part of a north-south alignment of volcanoes . Tacora itself has uncertain reports of historical eruptions and there are active fumaroles . The fumarolic activity has resulted in the emplacement of substantial deposits of sulfur , which were already mentioned centuries ago . Towards the latter 19th century , systematic mining of the sulfur deposits of Tacora occurred and substantial mining infrastructure was constructed on the mountain .",

Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , its highest summit is 5,868 metres ( 19,252 ft ) above sea level and features a summit crater that opens to the south . The western rim of the summit crater is formed by a compound of lava domes , the youngest of which features a vigorous fumarole that is visible from afar . Ollag\u00fce is mostly of Pleistocene age . It started developing more than one million years ago , forming the so-called Vinta Loma and Santa Rosa series mostly of andesitic lava flows . A fault bisects the edifice and two large landslides occurred in relation to it . Later two groups of dacitic lava domes formed , Ch'aska Urqu on the southeastern slope and La Celosa on the northwestern . Another centre named La Poru\u00f1ita formed at that time on the western foot of the volcano , but it is not clear whether it is part of the main Ollag\u00fce system . Activity at the summit continued during this time , forming the El Azufre sequence . This phase of edifice growth was interrupted by a major collapse of the western flank of Ollag\u00fce . Debris from the collapse spread in the form of hummocks down the western slope and into an adjacent salt pan , splitting it in two . The occurrence of this collapse was perhaps facilitated by a major crustal lineament that crosses Ollag\u00fce from southeast to northwest .",
