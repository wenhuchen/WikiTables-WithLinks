He is known for alleging that numerous Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the United States federal government , universities , film industry [ citation needed ] , and elsewhere . Ultimately , the smear tactics that he used led him to be censured by the U.S. Senate . The term McCarthyism , coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy 's practices , was soon applied to similar anti-communist activities . Today , the term is used more broadly to mean demagogic , reckless , and unsubstantiated accusations , as well as public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents . Born in Grand Chute , Wisconsin , McCarthy commissioned in to the Marine Corps in 1942 , where he served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron . Following the end of World War II , he attained the rank of major . He volunteered to fly twelve combat missions as a gunner-observer , acquiring the nickname Tail-Gunner Joe . Some of his claims of heroism were later shown to be exaggerated or falsified , leading many of his critics to use Tail-Gunner Joe as a term of mockery . McCarthy successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1946 , defeating Robert M. La Follette Jr. After three largely undistinguished years in the Senate , McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame in February 1950 when he asserted in a speech that he had a list of members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring who were employed in the State Department .",
