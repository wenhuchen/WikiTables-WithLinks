  "/wiki/Electric_power": "Electric Power is the rate , per unit time , at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit . The SI unit of power is the watt , one joule per second . Electric power is usually produced by electric generators , but can also be supplied by sources such as electric batteries . It is usually supplied to businesses and homes ( as domestic mains electricity ) by the electric power industry through an electric power grid . Electric energy is usually sold by the kilowatt hour ( 1 kW\u00b7h = 3.6 MJ ) which is the product of the power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours . Electric utilities measure energy using an electricity meter , which keeps a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer . Electric power can be delivered over long distances by transmission lines and used for applications such as motion , light or heat with high efficiency .",
  "/wiki/Reciprocating_engine": "A reciprocating engine , also often known as a piston engine , is typically a heat engine ( although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines ) that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion . This article describes the common features of all types . The main types are : the internal combustion engine , used extensively in motor vehicles ; the steam engine , the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution ; and the niche application Stirling engine . Internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways : either a spark-ignition ( SI ) engine , where the spark plug initiates the combustion ; or a compression-ignition ( CI ) engine , where the air within the cylinder is compressed , thus heating it , so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier .",

  "/wiki/Landfill_gas": "Landfill gas is a complex mix of different gases created by the action of microorganisms within a landfill . Landfill gas is approximately forty to sixty percent methane , with the remainder being mostly carbon dioxide . Trace amounts of other volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) comprise the remainder ( < 1% ) . These trace gases include a large array of species , mainly simple hydrocarbons . Landfill gases have an influence on climate change . The major components are CO2 and methane , both of which are greenhouse gas . Methane in the atmosphere is a far more potent greenhouse gas , with each molecule having twenty five times the effect of a molecule of carbon dioxide . Methane itself however accounts for less composition of the atmosphere than does carbon dioxide . Landfills are the third largest source of methane in the US .",
  "/wiki/Cannington_Mine": "The Cannington Silver and Lead Mine is an Australian underground mine located in north-west Queensland , in the Shire of McKinlay , about 200 kilometres ( 124 mi ) southeast of Mount Isa . The deposit was discovered by Broken Hill Proprietary Company ( BHP ) in 1990 . Although sitework and underground mining began in 1997 , full production was not achieved until early 1999 , with 1.5 million tons of ore processed in 1999 . Production since has reached 3 million tons of ore per year . As of 2010 [ update ] it was the largest and lowest cost silver and lead mine in the world . The expected life of the Cannington mine is 25 years . On August 19 , 2014 , the mine 's owner BHP Billiton announced it was splitting the company in two . A newly formed entity called South32 is to house BHP Billiton 's non-core businesses including the Cannington Mine .

  "/wiki/Natural_gas": "Natural gas ( also called fossil gas ) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes , and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide , or helium . It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years . The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change ; it itself is a greenhouse gas , and it releases carbon dioxide when burned . However , natural gas use often supplants coal use , which is far more environmentally damaging , leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas . Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic . Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments . Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material .",
  "/wiki/Diesel_fuel": "Diesel fuel /\u02c8di\u02d0z\u0259l/ in general is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines , whose fuel ignition takes place , without any spark , as a result of compression of the inlet air mixture and then injection of fuel . ( Glow plugs , grid heaters and block heaters help to achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather . ) Diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher thermodynamic efficiency and thus fuel efficiency . This is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load ; as their air supply is not throttled as in a petrol engine , their efficiency still remains very high . The most common type of diesel fuel is a specific fractional distillate of petroleum fuel oil , but alternatives that are not derived from petroleum , such as biodiesel , biomass to liquid ( BTL ) or gas to liquid ( GTL ) diesel , are increasingly being developed and adopted . To distinguish these types , petroleum-derived diesel is increasingly called petrodiesel . Ultra-low-sulfur diesel ( ULSD ) is a standard for defining diesel fuel with substantially lowered sulfur contents . As of 2016 , almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in the UK , mainland Europe , and North America is of a ULSD type . In the UK , diesel fuel for on-road use is commonly abbreviated DERV , standing for diesel-engined road vehicle , which carries a tax premium over equivalent fuel for non-road use . In Australia , diesel fuel is also known as distillate , and in Indonesia , it is known as Solar , a trademarked name by the local oil company Pertamina .",

  "/wiki/Coal_seam_gas": "Coalbed methane ( CBM or coal-bed methane ) , coalbed gas , coal seam gas ( CSG ) , or coal-mine methane ( CMM ) is a form of natural gas extracted from coal beds . In recent decades it has become an important source of energy in United States , Canada , Australia , and other countries . The term refers to methane adsorbed into the solid matrix of the coal . It is called 'sweet gas ' because of its lack of hydrogen sulfide . The presence of this gas is well known from its occurrence in underground coal mining , where it presents a serious safety risk . Coalbed methane is distinct from a typical sandstone or other conventional gas reservoir , as the methane is stored within the coal by a process called adsorption . The methane is in a near-liquid state , lining the inside of pores within the coal ( called the matrix ) . The open fractures in the coal ( called the cleats ) can also contain free gas or can be saturated with water . [ citation needed ] Unlike much natural gas from conventional reservoirs , coalbed methane contains very little heavier hydrocarbons such as propane or butane , and no natural-gas condensate . It often contains up to a few percent carbon dioxide .",

  "/wiki/Biogas": "Biogas is the mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen ( anaerobically ) , primarily consisting of methane and carbon dioxide . Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste , manure , municipal waste , plant material , sewage , green waste or food waste . Biogas is a renewable energy source . In India , it is also known as Gobar Gas . Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with methanogen or anaerobic organisms , which digest material inside a closed system , or fermentation of biodegradable materials . This closed system is called an anaerobic digester , biodigester or a bioreactor . Biogas is primarily methane ( CH4 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , moisture and siloxanes . The gases methane , hydrogen , and carbon monoxide ( CO ) can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen . This energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel ; it can be used for any heating purpose , such as cooking . It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat . Biogas can be compressed , the same way as natural gas is compressed to CNG , and used to power motor vehicles . In the United Kingdom , for example , biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around 17% of vehicle fuel .",
