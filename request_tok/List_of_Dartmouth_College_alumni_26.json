Brown was the Bengals ' head coach from their inception to 1975 . After being dismissed as the Browns ' head coach by Art Modell ( who had purchased majority interest in the team in 1961 ) in January 1963 , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus . He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city , Hamilton County , and Major League Baseball 's Cincinnati Reds ( who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field ) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games . Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL , which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season , Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise . The Bengals , like the other former AFL teams , were assigned to the AFC following the merger . Cincinnati was also selected because , like their neighbors the Reds , they could draw from several large neighboring cities ( Louisville and Lexington , Kentucky ; Columbus , Dayton , and Springfield , Ohio ) that are all no more than 110 miles ( 180 km ) away from downtown Cincinnati , along with Indianapolis , until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season .

The XFL was operated as a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation ( now the WWE ) and NBC . The XFL was conceived as an outdoor football league that would begin play immediately after the National Football League season ended to take advantage of lingering public desire to watch football after the NFL and college football seasons had concluded . It was promoted as having fewer rules to encourage rougher play than other major leagues . The league had eight teams in two divisions , including major markets and some not directly served by the NFL , such as Birmingham , Las Vegas , Memphis , and Orlando . The XFL operated as a single entity with all teams owned by the league , in contrast to most major professional leagues , which use a franchise model with individual owners . Co-owner NBC served as the main carrier of XFL games , along with UPN and TNN . The presentation of XFL games featured sports entertainment elements inspired by professional wrestling , including heat and kayfabe , suggestively-dressed cheerleaders , and occasional usage of WWF personalities ( such as Jesse Ventura , Jim Ross , and Jerry Lawler ) as part of on-air commentary crews alongside sportscasters and veteran football players . Despite the wrestling influence , the games and their outcomes were legitimate . The first night of play brought higher television viewership than NBC had projected , but ratings quickly nosedived . The league developed a negative reputation due to its connections to professional wrestling and the WWF , the overall quality of play , and a presentation that differed starkly from network football telecasts of the era ( albeit featuring on-air innovations that would later become commonplace in football telecasts , such as aerial skycams and on-player microphones ) .
