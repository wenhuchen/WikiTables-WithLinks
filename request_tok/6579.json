He reshaped Bengali literature and music , as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Author of the profoundly sensitive , fresh and beautiful verse of Gitanjali , he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Tagore 's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial ; however , his elegant prose and magical poetry remain largely unknown outside Bengal . He is sometimes referred to as the Bard of Bengal . A Brahmo Hindu from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan District and Jessore , Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old . At the age of sixteen , he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43ha ( Sun Lion ) , which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics . By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas , published under his real name . As a humanist , universalist , internationalist , and ardent anti-nationalist , he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain . As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance , he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings , sketches and doodles , hundreds of texts , and some two thousand songs ; his legacy also endures in the institution he founded , Visva-Bharati University . Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures . His novels , stories , songs , dance-dramas , and essays spoke to topics political and personal .",
