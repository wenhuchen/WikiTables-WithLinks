  "/wiki/Concept_car": "A concept car ( also known as a concept vehicle , show vehicle or prototype ) is a car made to showcase new styling and/or new technology . They are often shown at motor shows to gauge customer reaction to new and radical designs which may or may not be mass-produced . General Motors designer Harley Earl is generally credited with inventing the concept car , and did much to popularize it through its traveling Motorama shows of the 1950s . Concept cars never go into production directly . In modern times all would have to undergo many changes before the design is finalized for the sake of practicality , safety , regulatory compliance , and cost . A production-intent prototype , as opposed to a concept vehicle , serves this purpose .",

  "/wiki/SUVs": "Sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) is a category of motor vehicles that combine elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles , such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive . There is no commonly agreed definition of an SUV , and usage varies between countries . Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis ; however , broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV . A crossover SUV is defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction ( as per passenger cars ) , however in many cases crossovers are simply referred to as SUVs . In some countries - such as the United States - SUVs have been classified as light trucks , resulting in more lenient regulations compared to passenger cars . The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s , and the four-wheel drive station wagons and carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949 . The 1984 Jeep Cherokee ( XJ ) is considered to be the first SUV in the modern style . Most SUVs produced today use unibody construction ( as per passenger cars ) ; however , in the past many SUVs used body-on-frame construction . During the late 1990s and early 2000s , the popularity of SUVs greatly increased , often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons . More recently , smaller SUVs , mid-size and crossovers have become increasingly popular . SUVs are currently the world 's largest automotive segment and accounted for 36.8% of the world 's passenger car market in 2017 . SUVs are criticised for their impact on other road users and the environment .",
  "/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)": "A crossover - also called crossover or CUV - is a type of vehicle with unibody construction . Crossovers are often based on a platform shared with a passenger car ; compared to truck-based SUVs , they typically have better interior comfort , a more comfortable ride , and superior fuel economy , but less off-road capability . Poor off-road capability is compounded by many crossovers being sold without all-wheel drive , which challenges their definition as sports utility vehicles . Furthermore , there are various inconsistencies about whether some vehicles are considered crossovers or SUVs ; therefore the term SUV is often used as a catch-all for both crossovers and compact SUVs . Forerunners of the crossover include the 1977 Matra Rancho and AMC Eagle introduced in 1979 . In the United States as of 2006 [ update ] , crossover models comprised more than 50% of the overall SUV market . Crossovers have also become increasingly popular in Europe since the early 2010s .",
