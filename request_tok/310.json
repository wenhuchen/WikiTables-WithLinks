  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",

  "/wiki/Korea": "Korea is a region in East Asia consisting of the Korean Peninsula , Jeju Island , and several minor islands near the peninsula . Korea has been divided since 1948 between two distinct sovereign states , North Korea and South Korea . Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast , China to the northwest , and neighbours Japan to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) . During the first half of the 1st millennium , Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo , Baekje , and Silla , together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea . In the second half of the 1st millennium , Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo , leading to the Unified Silla period . Meanwhile , Balhae formed in the north , superseding former Goguryeo . Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war , ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms . Toward the end of the 1st millennium , Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo , which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state . Around the same time , Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo . Goryeo ( also spelled as Kory\u014f ) , whose name developed into the modern exonym Korea , was a highly cultured state that created the world 's first metal movable type in 1234 . However , multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation , which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting . Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo , severe political strife followed , and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye , who established Joseon in July 17 , 1392 .",
  "/wiki/Galloper_gun": "The Galloper gun is an artillery piece used circa 1740 in British colonies ( later the United States ) . It has 1\u00bd , 2 , 3 , 4 and rare 6 pound shell variants . The gun and carriage weighs around 600 pounds . The gun was designed to be pulled by one horse between the shafts and to keep up with fast moving troops , perhaps even cavalry . Gallopers were among the first attempts to give some degree of mobility to guns but the logistics of gun crew movement and ammunition transportation meant that the time to fire from a different location was not significantly reduced . The galloper carriage was not used in the Americas during the French and Indian War nor in the Revolutionary War . Smith 's Universal Military Dictionary of 1779 states its use by the King of Prussia in the previous war ( which was ? ) . The replacements for the North American campaign were the Townsend design 3 pounder and the Patterson design 3 pounder on grasshopper carriages and the Congreve designed light field 3 pounder shipped in 1776 . Several of these were taken from Burgoyne at Saratoga . Two original Townsends are found at the Smithsonian and West Point . The only Pattison original is in Perth , Canada . No original carriages exist but a gunner 's model of the grasshopper carriage is found at the Woolwich military museum .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Grasshopper_cannon": "Grasshopper was the nickname for a cannon used by the British in the late 18th century as a light battalion gun to support infantry . It was designed for service in rough terrain such as the frontiers of British North America . Its barrel was made of bronze instead of iron . Bronze is less brittle than cast iron , and so the barrel could be made thinner and lighter than that of an iron gun . Further , if a bronze gun developed a defect it would rupture ; an iron gun with a flaw would shatter , at great cost to its own crew . It fired a three-pound ball ( or 3 pounds of canister shot ) . Using the conventional bracket or split trail , the gun could be moved by its own crew using drag ropes and wooden shafts much like a handcart . Two straight shafts were placed on each side of the cheek pieces facing forward , and two angled ones at the trail . The appearance of the shafts when fixed in place led to the nickname of Grasshopper .",

  "/wiki/Saker_(cannon)": "The saker was a medium cannon , slightly smaller than a culverin , developed during the early 16th century and often used by the English . It was named after the saker falcon , a large falconry bird native to the Middle East . A saker 's barrel was approximately 9.5 ft ( 2.9m ) long , had a calibre of 3.25 inches ( 8.26 cm ) , and weighed approximately 1,900 lb ( 860 kg ) . It could fire round shot weighing 5.25 lb ( 2.4 kg ) approximately 7,400 ft ( 2.3 km ) using 4 lb ( 1.8 kg ) of black powder . The shot was intended to bounce along the ground to cause as much damage as possible , the explosive shell being rare before the 19th century . Tests performed in France during the 1950s show that a saker 's range was over 9,000 ft ( 2.7 km ) when fired at a 45-degree angle . Henry VIII amassed a large arsenal of sakers in the early 16th century as he expanded the Royal Navy and came into conflict with France . Henry 's foundries used so much bronze that there was a world shortage of tin . According to the inventory in the Anthony Roll , the Mary Rose carried several sakers , though none have been found so far and may have been recovered by salvagers soon after the disaster . Sakers were heavily used during the English Civil War , especially during sieges , when they were used by both attackers and defenders of fortified towns . They also saw action in the Jacobite rising of 1689 and were used by the armies of both William III and James II at the Battle of the Boyne . A French version of the saker is the couleuvrine moyenne , meaning middle sized , which was often used at sea .",
  "/wiki/Canon_de_4_de_Valli\u00e8re": "The Canon de 4 de Valli\u00e8re was a type of cannon designed by the French officer Florent-Jean de Valli\u00e8re ( 1667-1759 ) , Director-General of the Battalions and Schools of the Artillery . The cannon was a result of the Royal Ordonnance of October 7 , 1732 , enacted to reorganize and standardize the King 's artillery Whereas numerous formats and designs had been in place in the French army , De Valli\u00e8re standardized the French sizes in artillery pieces , by allowing only for the production of 24 , 12 , 8 and 4 pound guns , mortars of 13 and 9 inches , and stone-throwing mortars of 16 inches . The 24-pdr was the largest caliber available to French artillery in this system . The cannon used core drilling of the bore of cannons founded in one piece of bronze , a method developed at that time by Jean Maritz , which allowed for much higher precision of the bore shape and surface , and therefore higher shooting efficiency . As with other de Valliere guns , the 4-pdr was also highly decorated and contained numerous designs and inscriptions .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_France": "The Kingdom of France ( French : Royaume de France ) was a medieval and early modern monarchy in Western Europe . It was among the most powerful states in Europe and a great power since the Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years ' War . It was also an early colonial power , with possessions around the world . France originated as West Francia ( Francia Occidentalis ) , the western half of the Carolingian Empire , with the Treaty of Verdun ( 843 ) . A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987 , when Hugh Capet was elected king and founded the Capetian dynasty . The territory remained known as Francia and its ruler as rex Francorum ( king of the Franks ) well into the High Middle Ages . The first king calling himself Roi de France ( King of France ) was Philip II , in 1190 . France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines - the Valois and Bourbon - until the monarchy was abolished in 1792 during the French Revolution . France in the Middle Ages was a de-centralised , feudal monarchy . In Brittany and Catalonia ( now a part of Spain ) the authority of the French king was barely felt . Lorraine and Provence were states of the Holy Roman Empire and not yet a part of France . Initially , West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates , but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father 's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture , which became codified in the Salic law .",
  "/wiki/Korean_cannon": "Cannon appeared in Korea by the mid 14th century during the Goryeo dynasty and quickly proliferated as naval and fortress-defense weapons . Major developments occurred throughout the 15th century , including the introduction of large siege mortars as well as major improvements that drastically increased range , power , and accuracy . The Imjin War in the 1590s marked the beginning of a Korean military revolution which saw improvements in cannon design and the introduction and adaptation of foreign-based firearms . This included the en masse adoption of muskets and the adoption of volley fire and rigorous drill techniques . Breech-loading swivel guns were particularly popular as light anti-personnel artillery . With the rising threat of European powers in the 19th century , the Joseon dynasty made attempts at reverse-engineering European firearms but eventually had to simply buy them from foreign entities .",
