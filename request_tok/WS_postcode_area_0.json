In 2009 , the Staffordshire Hoard , the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork , was found 5.9 km ( 3.7 mi ) south-west of Lichfield . The development of the city was consolidated in the 12th century under Roger de Clinton , who fortified the Cathedral Close and also laid out the town with the ladder-shaped street pattern that survives to this day . Lichfield 's heyday was in the 18th century , when it developed into a thriving coaching city . This was a period of great intellectual activity , the city being the home of many famous people including Samuel Johnson , David Garrick , Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward , and prompted Johnson 's remark that Lichfield was a city of philosophers .
