  "/wiki/Assemblies_of_God": "The Assemblies of God ( AG ) , officially the World Assemblies of God Fellowship , is a group of over 144 autonomous self-governing associated national groupings of churches which together form the world 's largest Pentecostal denomination . It is the fourth largest international Christian group of denominations and the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world . As an international fellowship , the member denominations are entirely independent and autonomous ; however , they are united by shared beliefs and history . The Assemblies originated from the Azusa Street Revival of the early 20th century . This revival led to the founding of the Assemblies of God in the United States in 1914 . Through foreign missionary work and establishing relationships with other Pentecostal churches , the Assemblies of God expanded into a worldwide movement . It was not until 1988 , however , that the world fellowship was formed . As a Pentecostal fellowship , the Assemblies of God believes in the Pentecostal distinctive of baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues . The Assemblies of God should not be confused with the Assemblies of God International Fellowship , the International Assemblies of God Fellowship , and the Independent Assemblies of God International , all of which are Pentecostal denominations .",
  "/wiki/Pentecostalism": "Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement that emphasises direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit . The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost , the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks . For Christians , this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ , as described in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles . Like other forms of evangelical Protestantism , Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the necessity of accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior . It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing - two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement . Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness movement who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ . Believing that they were living in the end times , they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world . In 1900 , Charles Parham , an American evangelist and faith healer , began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism and along with William J. Seymour , a Wesleyan-Holiness preacher , he taught that this was the third work of grace . The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival , founded and led by Seymour in Los Angeles , California , resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States and the rest of the world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Workhouse": "In England and Wales , a workhouse ( Welsh : tloty ) was a total institution where those unable to support themselves were offered accommodation and employment . ( In Scotland , they were usually known as poorhouses . ) The earliest known use of the term workhouse is from 1631 , in an account by the mayor of Abingdon reporting that wee haue erected wthn our borough a workehouse to sett poore people to worke . The origins of the workhouse can be traced to the Poor Law Act of 1388 , which attempted to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers , and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor . However , mass unemployment following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular , and a series of bad harvests , meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable . The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse . Some Poor Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates , who generally lacked the skills or motivation to compete in the open market [ citation needed ] . Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones , crushing bones to produce fertiliser , or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike , perhaps the origin of the nickname the spike for a workhouse . As the 19th century wore on , workhouses increasingly became refuges for the elderly , infirm and sick rather than the able-bodied poor , and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals . Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930 , many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions under the control of local authorities . It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared , and with them the workhouses .",

Whilst anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of religious hermit , unlike hermits they were required to take a vow of stability of place , opting for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches . Also unlike hermits , anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite , following which they would be considered dead to the world , a type of living saint . Anchorites had a certain autonomy , as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority other than the bishop . The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of Christian monasticism . In the Catholic Church today , it is one of the Other Forms of Consecrated Life and governed by the same norms as the consecrated eremitic life . In England , the earliest recorded anchorites existed in the 11th century . Their highest number - around 200 anchorites - were recorded in the 13th century . From the 12th to the 16th centuries , female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male counterparts , sometimes by as many as four to one ( in the 13th century ) , dropping eventually to two to one ( in the 15th century ) . The gender of a high number of anchorites , however , is not recorded for these periods .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group .

Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position .

They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity . The group emerged from the Bible Student movement founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell , who also co-founded Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881 to organize and print the movement 's publications . A leadership dispute after Russell 's death resulted in several groups breaking away , with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining control of the Watch Tower Society and its properties .

The town is bordered to its north by the South Downs , to its west by the Adur Valley and to its south by the River Adur and Shoreham Beach on the English Channel . The town lies in the middle of the ribbon of urban development along the English south coast , approximately equidistant from the city of Brighton and Hove to the east and the town of Worthing to the west . Shoreham covers an area of 2,430 acres ( 980 ha ) and has a population of 20,547 ( 2011 census ) .",
  "/wiki/Roughcast": "Roughcast or pebbledash is a coarse plaster surface used on outside walls that consists of lime and sometimes cement mixed with sand , small gravel , and often pebbles or shells . The materials are mixed into a slurry and are then thrown at the working surface with a trowel or scoop . The idea is to maintain an even spread , free from lumps , ridges or runs and without missing any background . Roughcasting incorporates the stones in the mix , whereas pebbledashing adds them on top . According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition ( 1910-1911 ) , roughcast used to be a widespread exterior coating given to the walls of common dwellings and outbuildings , but it is now frequently employed for decorative effect on country houses , especially those built using timber framing ( half timber ) . Variety can be obtained on the surface of the wall by small pebbles of different colours , and in the Tudor period fragments of glass were sometimes embedded . Though it is an occasional home-design fad , its general unpopularity in the UK today is estimated to reduce the value of a property by up to 5% . However roughcasting remains very popular in Scotland and rural Ireland , with a high percentage of new houses still being built with roughcasting . [ citation needed ] This exterior wall finish was made popular in England and Wales during the 1920s , when housing was in greater demand , and house builders were forced to cut costs wherever they could , and used pebbledash to cover poor quality brick work , which also added rudimentary weather protection . Pebbles were dredged from the seabed to provide the building materials needed , although most modern pebbledash is actually not pebbles at all , but small and sharp flint chips , and should correctly be called Spar dash or spa dash . There are several varieties of this spar dash such as Canterbury spar , sharp-dash , sharpstone dash , thrown dash , pebble stucco , Derbyshire Spar , Yellow spar , golden gravel , black and white , and also sunflower . According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition , the central tower of St Albans Cathedral , built with Roman tiles from Verulamium , was covered with roughcast believed to be as old as the building .",
  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",
  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",
  "/wiki/Gospel_Standard": "The Gospel Standard ( church of the latter day pharisees ) is a Strict Baptist magazine first published in 1835 by William Gadsby . The current editor is Timothy Rosier . It was previously Benjamin Ashworth Ramsbottom . Many Strict Baptist churches are affiliated with and recognised by the publishers of the Gospel Standard .

  "/wiki/St_Mary_de_Haura_Church,_Shoreham-by-Sea": "St Mary de Haura Church is an Anglican church in the ancient New Shoreham area of Shoreham-by-Sea in the district of Adur , one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex . It was founded at the end of the 11th century as a large cruciform church which , due to its original scale , has been described as a collegiate church - a reflection of the port of Shoreham 's importance at the time . The former east end of that building survives to form the present church , and much 12th-century work remains . It functions as Shoreham-by-Sea 's town church for major religious and social events , as well as serving its small town-centre parish . English Heritage has listed it at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance .",
  "/wiki/Collegiate_church": "In Christianity , a collegiate church is a church where the daily office of worship is maintained by a college of canons : a non-monastic or secular community of clergy , organised as a self-governing corporate body , which may be presided over by a dean or provost . In its governance and religious observance a collegiate church is similar to a cathedral , although a collegiate church is not the seat of a bishop and has no diocesan responsibilities . Collegiate churches were often supported by extensive lands held by the church , or by tithe income from appropriated benefices . They commonly provide distinct spaces for congregational worship and for the choir offices of their clerical community .",
  "/wiki/St_Nicolas'_Church,_Shoreham-by-Sea": "St Nicolas Church is an Anglican church in Old Shoreham , an ancient inland settlement that is now part of the town of Shoreham-by-Sea in the district of Adur , one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex . It was founded on a riverside site by Anglo-Saxons at the start of the 10th century , possibly on the site of a 5th-century predecessor . Some Saxon-era structural elements remain despite 12th-century additions made when Shoreham became prosperous , further extension in the 14th century and a Victorian restoration . The cruciform structure , with its solid central tower , features some unusual Norman-era carving . English Heritage has listed it at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance .",
  "/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England": "The Norman conquest of England ( in Britain , often called the Norman Conquest or the Conquest ) was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman , Breton , Flemish , and French soldiers led by the Duke of Normandy , later styled William the Conqueror . William 's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor , who may have encouraged William 's hopes for the throne . Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson . The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford , but Godwinson 's army defeated and killed Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September . Within days , William landed in southern England . Harold marched south to oppose him , leaving a significant portion of his army in the north . Harold 's army confronted William 's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings ; William 's force defeated Harold , who was killed in the engagement . Although William 's main rivals were gone , he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072 . The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated ; some of the elite fled into exile . To control his new kingdom , William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land with the Domesday Book , a manuscript record of the Great Survey of much of England and parts of Wales being completed by 1086 . Other effects of the conquest included the court and government , the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites , and changes in the composition of the upper classes , as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king . More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life : the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery , which may or may not have been linked to the invasion .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",
  "/wiki/Crossing_(architecture)": "A crossing , in ecclesiastical architecture , is the junction of the four arms of a cruciform ( cross-shaped ) church . In a typically oriented church ( especially of Romanesque and Gothic styles ) , the crossing gives access to the nave on the west , the transept arms on the north and south , and the choir , as the first part of the chancel , on the east . The crossing is sometimes surmounted by a tower or dome . A large crossing tower is particularly common on English Gothic cathedrals . With the Renaissance , building a dome above the crossing became popular . Because the crossing is open on four sides , the weight of the tower or dome rests heavily on the corners ; a stable construction thus required great skill on the part of the builders . In centuries past , it was not uncommon for overambitious crossing towers to collapse . Sacrist Alan of Walsingham 's octagon , built between 1322 and 1328 after the collapse of Ely 's nave crossing on 22 February 1322 , is the . greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at Ely Cathedral according to architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner . A tower over the crossing may be called a lantern tower if it has openings through which light from outside can shine down to the crossing . In Early Medieval churches , the crossing square was often used as a module , or a unit of measurement . The nave and transept would have lengths that were a certain multiple of the length of the crossing square .",

  "/wiki/Terracotta": "Terracotta , terra cotta or terra-cotta ( pronounced [ \u02cct\u025brra\u02c8k\u0254tta ] ; Italian : baked earth , from the Latin terra cocta ) , a type of earthenware , is a clay-based unglazed or glazed ceramic , where the fired body is porous . Terracotta is the term normally used for sculpture made in earthenware , and also for various practical uses including vessels ( notably flower pots ) , water and waste water pipes , roofing tiles , bricks , and surface embellishment in building construction . The term is also used to refer to the natural brownish orange color of most terracotta , which varies considerably . [ citation needed ] This article covers the senses of terracotta as a medium in sculpture , as in the Terracotta Army and Greek terracotta figurines , and architectural decoration . Asian and European sculpture in porcelain is not covered . Glazed architectural terracotta and its unglazed version as exterior surfaces for buildings were used in Asia for some centuries before becoming popular in the West in the 19th century . Architectural terracotta can also refer to decorated ceramic elements such as antefixes and revetments , which made a large contribution to the appearance of temples and other buildings in the classical architecture of Europe , as well as in the Ancient Near East . [ citation needed ] In archaeology and art history , terracotta is often used to describe objects such as figurines not made on a potter 's wheel . Vessels and other objects that are or might be made on a wheel from the same material are called earthenware pottery ; the choice of term depends on the type of object rather than the material or firing technique . Unglazed pieces , and those made for building construction and industry , are also more likely to be referred to as terracotta , whereas tableware and other vessels are called earthenware ( though sometimes terracotta if unglazed ) , or by a more precise term such as faience .

  "/wiki/Wesleyanism": "Wesleyan theology , otherwise known as Wesleyan-Arminian theology , or Methodist theology , is a theological tradition in Protestant Christianity that emphasizes the methods of the eighteenth-century evangelical reformers John Wesley and his brother Charles Wesley . More broadly , it refers to the theological system inferred from the various sermons , theological treatises , letters , journals , diaries , hymns , and other spiritual writings of the Wesleys and their contemporary coadjutors such as John William Fletcher . Wesleyan-Arminian theology , manifest today in Methodism ( inclusive of the Holiness movement ) , is named for its founders , the Wesleys , as well as for Jacob Arminius , since it is a subset of Arminian theology . In 1736 , these two brothers traveled to the Georgia colony in America as missionaries for the Church of England ; they left rather disheartened at what they saw . Both of them subsequently had religious experiences , especially John in 1738 , being greatly influenced by the Moravian Christians . They began to organize a renewal movement within the Church of England to focus on personal faith and holiness . John Wesley took Protestant churches to task over the nature of sanctification , the process by which a believer is conformed to the image of Christ , emphasizing New Testament teachings regarding the work of God and the believer in sanctification . The movement did well within the Church of England in Britain , but when the movement crossed the ocean into America , it took on a form of its own , finally being established as the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1784 . The Methodist churches are similar to Anglicanism ( in Church government and liturgical practices ) , yet have added a strong emphasis on personal faith and personal experience , especially on the new birth and entire sanctification . At its heart , the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness : to love God with all ones heart , mind , soul and strength , and to love one 's neighbour as oneself . Wesleys teaching also stressed experiential religion and moral responsibility .",
  "/wiki/Flint": "Flint is a sedimentary cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz , categorized as the variety of chert that occurs in chalk or marly limestone . Flint was widely used historically to make stone tools and start fires . It occurs chiefly as nodules and masses in sedimentary rocks , such as chalks and limestones . Inside the nodule , flint is usually dark grey , black , green , white or brown in colour , and often has a glassy or waxy appearance . A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour , typically white and rough in texture . The nodules can often be found along streams and beaches . Flint breaks and chips into sharp-edged pieces , making it useful for knife blades and other cutting tools . The use of flint to make stone tools dates back millions of years , and flint 's extreme durability has made it possible to accurately date its use over this time . Flint is one of the primary materials used to define the Stone Age . During the Stone Age , access to flint was so important for survival that people would travel or trade to obtain flint . Flint Ridge in Ohio was an important source of flint and Native Americans extracted the flint from hundreds of quarries along the ridge . This Ohio Flint was traded across the eastern United States and has been found as far west as the Rocky Mountains and south around the Gulf of Mexico .",

The ancient Christian churches all venerate Peter as a major saint and as the founder of the Church of Antioch and the Roman Church , but differ in their attitudes regarding the authority of his present-day successors ( the primacy of the Bishop of Rome ) . According to Catholic teaching , in Matthew 16:18 Jesus promised Peter a special position in the Church . Two general epistles in the New Testament are ascribed to Peter , but modern scholars generally reject the Petrine authorship of both .
