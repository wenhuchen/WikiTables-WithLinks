Fossils of this genus date to the Late Jurassic period , where they are found in Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian aged strata , between 155 and 150 million years ago , in the western United States and Portugal . Of the species that have been classified in the upper Morrison Formation of the western US , only three are universally recognized ; S. stenops , S. ungulatus and S. sulcatus . The remains of over 80 individual animals of this genus have been found . Stegosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as Apatosaurus , Diplodocus , Brachiosaurus , Allosaurus , and Ceratosaurus ; the latter two may have preyed on it . These were large , heavily built , herbivorous quadrupeds with rounded backs , short fore limbs , long hind limbs , and tails held high in the air . Due to their distinctive combination of broad , upright plates and tail tipped with spikes , Stegosaurus is one of the most recognizable kinds of dinosaurs . The function of this array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists . Today , it is generally agreed that their spiked tails were most likely used for defense against predators , while their plates may have been used primarily for display , and secondarily for thermoregulatory functions . Stegosaurus had a relatively low brain-to-body mass ratio . It had a short neck and a small head , meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs . One species , Stegosaurus ungulatus , is the largest known of all the stegosaurians ( bigger than related dinosaurs such as Kentrosaurus and Huayangosaurus ) .",

It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east , Massachusetts to the north , New York to the west , and Long Island Sound to the south . Its capital is Hartford and its most populous city is Bridgeport . It is part of New England , although portions of it are often grouped with New York and New Jersey as the tri-state area . The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state . The word Connecticut is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for long tidal river . Connecticut 's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small , short-lived settlement called Fort Hoop in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers . Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony New Netherland , which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers , although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English . Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony ; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony . The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders , considered the first constitutions in America .

Three skeletons were discovered in northern Arizona in 1940 , and the two best preserved were collected in 1942 . The most complete specimen became the holotype of a new species in the genus Megalosaurus , named M. wetherilli by Samuel P. Welles in 1954 . Welles found a larger skeleton belonging to the same species in 1964 . Realizing it bore crests on its skull , he assigned the species to the new genus Dilophosaurus in 1970 , as Dilophosaurus wetherilli . The genus name means two-crested lizard , and the species name honors John Wetherill , a Navajo councilor . Further specimens have since been found , including an infant . Footprints have also been attributed to the animal , including resting traces . Another species , Dilophosaurus sinensis from China , was named in 1993 , but was later found to belong to the genus Sinosaurus . At about 7 meters ( 23 ft ) in length , with a weight of about 400 kilograms ( 880 lb ) , Dilophosaurus was one of the earliest large predatory dinosaurs , though it was smaller than some later theropods .

Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country , Washington was named after George Washington , the first president of the United States and a Founding Father . As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States .

The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century .

The fossils were found in rocks dating from near the end of the Early Cretaceous ( Aptian-early Albian ) , a time when sauropod diversity in North America had greatly diminished . It was the last known North American sauropod prior to an absence of the group on the continent of roughly 40 million years that ended with the appearance of Alamosaurus during the Maastrichtian . While the holotype remains were initially discovered in 1994 , due to their unexpected age and unusual size they were initially misclassified as pieces of petrified wood . A more detailed analysis in 1999 revealed their true nature which resulted in a minor media frenzy , and formal publication of the find the following year . Paleoecological analysis indicates that Sauroposeidon lived on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , in a river delta . Extrapolations based on the more completely known Brachiosaurus indicate that the head of Sauroposeidon could reach 17-18 m ( 56-59 ft ) in height with its neck extended , which would make it the tallest known dinosaur . With an estimated length of 27-34 m ( 89-112 ft ) and a mass of 40-60 t ( 44-66 short tons ) , it also ranks among the longest and heaviest . However , this animal may not be as closely related to Brachiosaurus as previously thought , so these estimates may be inaccurate . While initially described as a brachiosaurid closely related to Brachiosaurus and Giraffatitan , the discovery of additional remains in the Cloverly Formation of Wyoming suggested that it was in fact more closely related to the titanosaurs , in the group Somphospondyli . Analysis of these remains and comparison with others from Texas supported this conclusion , and demonstrated that the more completely known sauropods from the Twin Mountains Formation ( including a partial skull and fossil trackways ) previously named Paluxysaurus jonesi also belonged to Sauroposeidon .

Its fossils have been found in the Arundel Formation , which has been dated through palynomorphs to the Albian about 112 million years ago . Adults are estimated to have been more than 9 m ( 30 ft ) high and 15 to 18 m ( 50 to 60 ft ) long .",
  "/wiki/Utah": "Utah ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0t\u0251\u02d0/ YOO-tah , /\u02c8ju\u02d0t\u0254\u02d0/ ( listen ) YOO-taw ) is a state in the western United States . It became the 45th state admitted to the U.S. on January 4 , 1896 . Utah is the 13th-largest by area , 30th-most-populous , and 11th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States . Utah has a population of more than 3 million according to the Census estimate for July 1 , 2018 . Urban development is mostly concentrated in two areas : the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state , which contains approximately 2.5 million people ; and Washington County in Southern Utah , with over 160,000 residents . Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east , Wyoming to the northeast , Idaho to the north , Arizona to the south , and Nevada to the west . It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast . Approximately 62% of Utahns are reported to be members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) , making Utah the only state with a majority population belonging to a single church . This greatly influences Utahn culture , politics , and daily life . The church 's world headquarters is located in Salt Lake City . The state is a center of transportation , education , information technology and research , government services , and mining and a major tourist destination for outdoor recreation . In 2013 , the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that Utah had the second-fastest-growing population of any state .",
  "/wiki/Utahraptor": "Utahraptor ( meaning Utah 's predator ) is a genus of large dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Early Cretaceous period . It was a heavy-built , ground-dwelling , bipedal carnivore . It contains a single species , Utahraptor ostrommaysi , which is the largest-known member of the family Dromaeosauridae . In 2018 , it was proposed that Utahraptor be the Utah state dinosaur , an act that was approved by the Senate . Initially Utahraptor would have replaced another dinosaur , Allosaurus , as the state 's official fossil , but it was decided that Utahraptor would be another symbol of the state .",
  "/wiki/Wyoming": "Wyoming ( /wa\u026a\u02c8o\u028am\u026a\u014b/ ( listen ) ) is a state in the mountain region of the Western United States . The state is the 10th largest by area , the least populous , and the second most sparsely populated state in the country . Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana , on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska , on the south by Colorado , on the southwest by Utah , and on the west by Idaho and Montana . The state population was estimated at 577,737 in 2018 , which is less than 31 of the most populous U.S. cities including Denver in neighboring Colorado . Cheyenne is the state capital and the most populous city , with an estimated population of 63,624 in 2017 . The western two-thirds of the state is covered mostly by the mountain ranges and rangelands of the Rocky Mountains , while the eastern third of the state is high elevation prairie called the High Plains . Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the U.S. government , leading Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state 's land owned by the federal government . Federal lands include two national parks - Grand Teton and Yellowstone - two national recreation areas , two national monuments , several national forests , historic sites , fish hatcheries , and wildlife refuges . Original inhabitants of the region include the Crow , Arapaho , Lakota , and Shoshone . Southwestern Wyoming was claimed by the Spanish Empire and then Mexican territory until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican-American War . The region acquired the name Wyoming when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress in 1865 to provide a temporary government for the territory of Wyoming . The name was used earlier for the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania , and is derived from the Munsee word xw\u00e9 : wam\u0259nk , meaning at the big river flat .",
  "/wiki/Triceratops_horridus": "Triceratops is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that first appeared during the late Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous period , about 68 million years ago ( mya ) in what is now North America . It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur genera , and became extinct in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago . The name Triceratops , which literally means three-horned face , is derived from the Ancient Greek words \u03c4\u03c1\u03af- ( tri- ) meaning three , \u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 ( k\u00e9ras ) meaning horn , and \u1f64\u03c8 ( \u014dps ) meaning face . Triceratops has been documented by numerous remains collected since the genus was first described in 1889 by Othniel Charles Marsh . Specimens representing life stages from hatchling to adult have been found . As the archetypal ceratopsid , Triceratops is one of the most popular dinosaurs , and has been featured in film , postal stamps , and many other types of media . Bearing a large bony frill and three horns on the skull , and its large four-legged body possessing similarities with the modern rhinoceros , Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best-known ceratopsid . It was also one of the largest , up to nine metres long and twelve tonnes in weight . It shared the landscape with and was probably preyed upon by Tyrannosaurus , though it is less certain that the two did battle in the manner often depicted in museum displays and popular images . The functions of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired debate . Traditionally , these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators . More recent interpretations find it probable that these features were primarily used in species identification , courtship and dominance display , much like the antlers and horns of modern ungulates ."
