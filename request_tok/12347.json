  "/wiki/Cleveland_Indians": "The Cleveland Indians are an American professional baseball team based in Cleveland , Ohio . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) Central division . Since 1994 , they have played at Progressive Field . The team 's spring training facility is at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear , Arizona . Since their establishment as a major league franchise in 1901 , the team has won 10 Central Division titles , six American League pennants , and two World Series championships , ( in 1920 and 1948 ) . The team 's current 71-year World Series championship drought is the longest active among all 30 current Major League teams . The name Indians originated from a request by club owner Charles Somers to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace Cleveland Naps following the departure of Nap Lajoie after the 1914 season . It was a revival of the nickname that fans gave to the Cleveland Spiders while Louis Sockalexis , a Native American , was playing for the team . Common nicknames for the Indians include the Tribe and the Wahoos , the latter referencing their former logo , Chief Wahoo . The team 's mascot is named Slider . The franchise originated in 1894 as the Grand Rapids Rustlers , a minor league team in the Western League . The team relocated to Cleveland in 1900 and was renamed the Cleveland Lake Shores .",
  "/wiki/1948_World_Series": "The 1948 World Series saw the Cleveland Indians against the Boston Braves . The Braves had won the National League pennant for the first time since the Miracle Braves team of 1914 , while the Indians had spoiled a chance for the only all-Boston World Series by winning a one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox for the American League flag . Though superstar pitcher Bob Feller failed to win either of his two starts , the Indians won the Series in six games to capture their second championship and their first since 1920 ( as well as their last to the present date ) . It was the first World Series to be televised beyond the previous year 's limited New York-Schenectady-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington network and was announced by famed sportcasters Red Barber , Tom Hussey ( in Boston ) and Van Patrick ( in Cleveland ) . This was the second appearance in the Fall Classic for both teams , with the Indians ' lone previous appearance coming in a 1920 win against the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Braves ' lone previous appearance coming in a 1914 win against the Philadelphia Athletics . Consequently , this was the first , and to date only , World Series in which both participating teams had previously played in , but not yet lost , a previous World Series . Currently , this phenomenon can only be repeated if either the Miami Marlins or the Arizona Diamondbacks play against either the Toronto Blue Jays or the Los Angeles Angels in a future World Series . Television coverage of the World Series increased this year , but due to the medium still being in its infancy coverage was strictly regional . Games played in Boston could only be seen in the Northeast , while when the series shifted to Cleveland those games were the first to be aired in Chicago , Pittsburgh , Milwaukee , St. Louis , Detroit and Toledo . This was the only World Series from 1947 to 1958 not to feature a New York team , and also the last World Series until 1957 not won by a New York team ( which the Braves won over the Yankees , after they had relocated to Milwaukee ) . The teams would meet again in the 1995 World Series won by the Braves - by then relocated to Atlanta . This was the first World Series and the last until 2016 where the series score was even .",

The series was played between October 25 and November 2 ( although Game 7 ended slightly after 12:00 am local time on November 3 ) . The Indians had home-field advantage because the AL had won the 2016 All-Star Game . This was the final World Series to have home-field advantage determined by the All-Star Game results ; since 2017 , home-field advantage has been awarded to the team with the better record . The Cubs defeated the Indians 4 games to 3 to win their first World Series since 1908 . Game 7 , an 8-7 victory in 10 innings , marked the fifth time that a Game 7 had gone into extra innings and the first since 1997 ( which the Indians also lost ) . It was also the first Game 7 to have a rain delay , which occurred as the tenth inning was about to start . The Cubs became the sixth team to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series , following the 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates , the 1958 New York Yankees , the 1968 Detroit Tigers , the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates , and the 1985 Kansas City Royals . The Cubs , playing in their eleventh World Series and their first since 1945 , won their third championship and first since 1908 , ending the longest world championship drought in North American professional sports history . It was the Indians ' sixth appearance in the World Series and their first since 1997 , with their last Series win having come in 1948 . Cleveland manager Terry Francona , who had previously won World Series titles with the Boston Red Sox in 2004 and 2007 , fell short in his bid to become the third manager to win his first three trips to the Fall Classic , after Casey Stengel and Joe Torre .",

Maris ultimately broke the record when he hit his 61st home run on the final day of the regular season , while Mantle was forced out of the lineup in late-September due to a hip infection and finished with 54 home runs . In response to the proposed Continental League , the American League expanded by two teams in the first MLB expansion since 1901 . The original Washington Senators moved to Minnesota and became the Minnesota Twins . The American League therefore placed a new team in Washington , also called the Senators . Also , the American League placed a team in Los Angeles called the Los Angeles Angels . In order to keep its schedule balanced , the American League season was extended by eight games . Previously , teams had played 154 games ( 22 games per opponent ) , but from 1961 AL teams would play opponents 18 times each for a total of 162 games . The National League played a 154 game schedule for the final time in 1961 before switching to 162 games when they also expanded to ten teams for the following season .",

The Series was noted for its back-and-forth Game 6 , in which the Cardinals erased a two-run deficit in the bottom of the ninth inning , then did it again in the 10th . In both innings , the Rangers were one strike away from their first World Series championship . The Cardinals won the game in the 11th inning on a walk-off home run by David Freese .

The Pirates are also often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos ( derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ) . The team plays its home games at PNC Park , its home since 2001 . The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909-1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium , so named because of its location near the confluence of the Allegheny , Monongahela , and Ohio rivers , from 1970-2000 . The franchise joined the NL in its eighth season in 1887 and was competitive from its early years , winning three NL titles from 1901 to 1903 , playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner .

Grant Jackson pitched for the Orioles in the 1971 series and for the Pirates in the 1979 series .

Willie Stargell , who was named the World Series Most Valuable Player , hit .400 with a record seven extra-base hits and matched Reggie Jackson 's record of 25 total bases , set in 1977 .

He bought the rights to the Angels name from Walter O'Malley , the then-Los Angeles Dodgers owner , who acquired the PCL franchise from Philip K.
