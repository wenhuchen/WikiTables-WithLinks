Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events . Women 's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts . After a poll was taken indicating that only nine countries would send a bobsled team , the organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue , so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program . Cold War politics forced the IOC to debate the participation of China and Taiwan . The United States supported Taiwan while the Soviet Union stood behind China . Given the fact that the 1960 Games were to be held in America , there was concern among IOC members that the United States would not allow China or any other Communist country to participate .

The games are also remembered for the heroic failure of British ski jumper Eddie The Eagle Edwards , and the Winter Olympic d\u00e9but of the Jamaica national bobsled team , both of which would be subjects of major feature films about their participation in the games .

The five purpose-built venues continue to be used in their original functions , and have helped the country develop into one of the top nations in Winter Olympic competition ; Canada more than quintupled the five medals it won in Calgary at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics .",
