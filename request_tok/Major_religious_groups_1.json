  "/wiki/Taoism": "Daoism ( /\u02c8da\u028a\u026az\u0259m/ , /\u02c8da\u028a-/ ) , or Taoism ( /\u02c8ta\u028a-/ ) , is a philosophical or religious tradition of Chinese origin which emphasises living in harmony with the Dao ( Chinese : \u9053 ; pinyin : D\u00e0o ; literally : 'the Way ' , also romanized as Tao ) . The Dao is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools ; in Daoism , however , it denotes the principle that is the source , pattern and substance of everything that exists . Daoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasising rigid rituals and social order , but is similar in the sense that it is a teaching about the various disciplines for achieving perfection by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe called the way or dao . Daoist ethics vary depending on the particular school , but in general tend to emphasise wu wei ( action without intention ) , naturalness , simplicity , spontaneity , and the Three Treasures : \u6148 compassion , \u5109 frugality , and \u4e0d\u6562\u70ba\u5929\u4e0b\u5148 humility . The roots of Daoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE . Early Daoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang ( Naturalists ) , and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture , the I Ching ( Yi Jing ) , which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature . The Legalist Shen Buhai ( c. 400 - c. 337 BCE ) may also have been a major influence , expounding a realpolitik of wu wei . The Dao De Jing , a compact book containing teachings attributed to Laozi ( \u8001\u5b50 ; L\u01ceoz\u01d0 ; Lao\u00b3 Tz\u016d\u00b3 ) , is widely considered the keystone work of the Daoist tradition , together with the later writings of Zhuangzi . Daoism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries , and Daoists ( \u9053\u58eb ; d\u00e0oshi , masters of the Dao ) , a title traditionally attributed only to the clergy and not to their lay followers , usually take care to note distinction between their ritual tradition and the practices of Chinese folk religion and non-Taoist vernacular ritual orders , which are often mistakenly identified as pertaining to Daoism . Chinese alchemy ( especially neidan ) , Chinese astrology , Chan ( Zen ) Buddhism , several martial arts , traditional Chinese medicine , feng shui , and many styles of qigong have been intertwined with Daoism throughout history . Beyond China , Taoism also had influence on surrounding societies in Asia . Today , the Daoist tradition is one of the five religious doctrines officially recognised in the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) as well as the Republic of China ( ROC ) , and although it does not travel readily from its East Asian roots , [ citation needed ] it claims adherents in a number of societies , in particular in Hong Kong , Macau , and in Southeast Asia .",
  "/wiki/Religion_in_China": "The government of China officially espouses state atheism , though Chinese civilization has historically long been a cradle and host to a variety of the most enduring religio-philosophical traditions of the world . Confucianism and Taoism ( Daoism ) , later joined by Buddhism , constitute the three teachings that have shaped Chinese culture . There are no clear boundaries between these intertwined religious systems , which do not claim to be exclusive , and elements of each enrich popular or folk religion . The emperors of China claimed the Mandate of Heaven and participated in Chinese religious practices . In the early 20th century , reform-minded officials and intellectuals attacked all religions as superstitious , and since 1949 , China has been governed by the Communist Party of China , an atheist institution that prohibits party members from practicing religion while in office . In the culmination of a series of atheistic and anti-religious campaigns already underway since the late 19th century , the Cultural Revolution against old habits , ideas , customs and culture , lasting from 1966 to 1976 , destroyed or forced them underground . :138 Under following leaders , religious organisations were given more autonomy . The government formally recognizes five religions : Buddhism , Taoism , Catholicism , Protestantism , and Islam ( though the Chinese Catholic Church is independent of the Catholic Church in Rome ) . In the early twenty-first century there has been increasing official recognition of Confucianism and Chinese folk religion as part of China 's cultural inheritance . Folk or popular religion , the most widespread system of beliefs and practices , has evolved and adapted since at least the Shang and Zhou dynasties in the second millennium BCE . Fundamental elements of a theology and spiritual explanation for the nature of the universe harken back to this period and were further elaborated in the Axial Age . Basically , Chinese religion involves allegiance to the shen , often translated as spirits , defining a variety of gods and immortals .",

Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers ( 3,700,000 sq mi ) , it is the third largest country by area . [ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",
  "/wiki/Shinto": "Shinto , [ a ] also known as Shintoism or kami-no-michi , [ b ] is a religion originating from Japan . Classified as an East Asian religion by scholars of religion , its practitioners often regard it as Japan 's indigenous religion . Scholars sometimes call its practitioners Shintoists , although adherents rarely use that term themselves . Shinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami ( gods or spirits ) , supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things . The link between the kami and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered animistic and pantheistic . The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines , family shrines , and public shrines . The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion 's adherents . Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances , age specific celebrations , and seasonal festivals . These festivals and rituals are collectively called matsuri . A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing . Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity , reverence for kami , and regular communion following seasonal practices . Shinto has no single creator or specific doctrinal text , but exists in a diverse range of localized and regionalised forms .",
  "/wiki/Religion_in_Japan": "Religion in Japan is dominated by Shinto ( the ethnic religion of the Japanese people ) and by Buddhism . According to surveys carried out in 2006 and 2008 , less than 40% of the population of Japan identifies with an organized religion : around 35% are Buddhists , 3% to 4% are members of Shinto sects and derived religions , and from fewer than 1% to 2.3% are Christians . [ note 2 ] Most of the Japanese ( 50% to 80% considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism , shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d ) pray and worship ancestors and gods ( \u795e , kami , shin or , archaically , jin ) at Shinto shrines or at private altars , while not identifying as Shinto or Shintoist in surveys . This is because these terms have little meaning for the majority of the Japanese , or because they define membership in Shinto organizations or sects . The term religion ( \u5b97\u6559 , sh\u016bky\u014d ) itself in Japanese culture defines only organized religions ( that is , religions with specific doctrines and required membership ) . People who identify as non-religious ( \u7121\u5b97\u6559 , mush\u016bky\u014d ) in surveys actually mean that they do not belong to any religious organization , even though they may take part in Shinto rituals and worship . Jesse LeFebvre has explored the manner in which non-religiousness is deployed as an identity by Japanese in articulating their religious outlook . Some scholars , such as Jun'ichi Isomae and Jason \u0100nanda Josephson , have challenged the usefulness of the term religion in regard to Japanese traditions , arguing that the Japanese term and concept of religion ( sh\u016bky\u014d ) is an invention of the 19th century . However , other scholars , such as Hans Martin Kramer and Ian Reader , regard such claims as overstated and contend that the terms relate to terminology and categorizations that existed in Japan prior to the 19th century .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue , and identifies as a qigong practice of the Buddhist school , though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from Taoist traditions . Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation , practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to eliminate attachments , and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment . Falun Gong originated and was first taught publicly in northeastern China in 1992 by Li Hongzhi . It emerged toward the end of China 's qigong boom - a period that saw a proliferation of similar practices of meditation , slow-moving energy exercises and regulated breathing . It differs from other qigong schools in its absence of fees or formal membership , lack of daily rituals of worship , its greater emphasis on morality , and the theological nature of its teachings . Western academics have described Falun Gong as a qigong discipline , a spiritual movement , a cultivation system in the tradition of Chinese antiquity , or as a form of Chinese religion . The practice initially enjoyed support from Chinese officialdom , but by the mid to late 1990s , the Communist Party and public security organizations increasingly viewed Falun Gong as a potential threat due to its size , independence from the state , and spiritual teachings . By 1999 , government estimates placed the number of Falun Gong practitioners at 70 million . During that time , negative coverage of Falun Gong began to appear in the state-run press , and practitioners usually responded by picketing the source involved . Most of the time , the practitioners succeeded , but controversy and tension continued to build . The scale of protests grew until April 1999 , when over 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered near the central government compound in Beijing to request legal recognition and freedom from state interference .",

Sikhism is one of the youngest of the major world religions and the world 's fifth largest organized religion , as well as being the world 's ninth-largest overall religion . The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism , articulated in the sacred scripture Guru Granth Sahib , include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator , divine unity and equality of all humankind , engaging in selfless service , striving for justice for the benefit and prosperity of all and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder 's life . As of the early 21st century , there are about 25 million Sikhs . Sikhism is based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak , the first Guru ( 1469-1539 ) , and the nine Sikh gurus that succeeded him . The tenth Guru , Guru Gobind Singh , named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor , terminating the line of human Gurus and making the scripture the eternal , religious spiritual guide for Sikhs . Sikhism rejects claims that any particular religious tradition has a monopoly on Absolute Truth . The Sikh scripture opens with Ik Onkar ( \u0a74 ) , its Mul Mantar and fundamental prayer about One Supreme Being ( God ) . Sikhism emphasizes simran ( meditation on the words of the Guru Granth Sahib ) , that can be expressed musically through kirtan or internally through Nam Japo ( repeat God 's name ) as a means to feel God 's presence . It teaches followers to transform the Five Thieves ( lust , rage , greed , attachment , and ego ) . Guru Nanak taught that living an active , creative , and practical life of truthfulness , fidelity , self-control and purity is above the metaphysical truth , and that the ideal man is one who establishes union with God , knows His Will , and carries out that Will . Guru Hargobind , the sixth Sikh Guru , established the political/temporal ( Miri ) and spiritual ( Piri ) realms to be mutually coexistent .",

The Harappan people of the Indus Valley Civilisation , which lasted from 3300 to 1300 BCE ( mature period 2600-1900 BCE ) , had an early urbanized culture which predates the Vedic religion . [ better source needed ] The documented history of Indian religions begins with the historical Vedic religion , the religious practices of the early Indo-Iranians , which were collected and later redacted into the Vedas . The period of the composition , redaction and commentary of these texts is known as the Vedic period , which lasted from roughly 1750 to 500 BCE . The philosophical portions of the Vedas were summarized [ weasel words ] in Upanishads , which are commonly referred to as Ved\u0101nta , variously interpreted to mean either the last chapters , parts of the Veda or the object , the highest purpose of the Veda . The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era , five [ note 2 ] of the eleven principal Upanishads were composed in all likelihood before 6th century BCE , and contain the earliest mentions of Yoga and Moksha . The Reform or Shramanic Period between 800 and 200 BCE marks a turning point between the Vedic Hinduism and Puranic Hinduism . The Shramana movement , an ancient Indian religious movement parallel to but separate from Vedic tradition , often defied many of the Vedic and Upanishadic concepts of soul ( Atman ) and the ultimate reality ( Brahman ) . In 6th century BCE , the Shramnic movement matured into Jainism and Buddhism and was responsible for the schism of Indian religions into two main philosophical branches of astika , which venerates Veda ( e.g. , six orthodox schools of Hinduism ) and nastika ( e.g. , Buddhism , Jainism , Charvaka , etc .",

The Torah is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or the Hebrew Bible , and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud . With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide , Judaism is the tenth largest religion in the world . Within Judaism there are a variety of movements , most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism , which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah . Historically , all or part of this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period ; the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period ; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations . Modern branches of Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism may be nontheistic . Today , the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism ( Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism ) , Conservative Judaism , and Reform Judaism . Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to Jewish law , the authority of the Rabbinic tradition , and the significance of the State of Israel . Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin , eternal and unalterable , and that they should be strictly followed .

In its narrowest sense , it is equivalent to the historical region of Syria , which included present-day Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine . In its widest historical sense , the Levant included all of the Eastern Mediterranean with its islands ; that is , it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores , extending from Greece to Cyrenaica in eastern Libya . The term entered English in the late 15th century from French . It derives from the Italian Levante , meaning rising , implying the rising of the sun in the east , and is broadly equivalent to the term al-Mashriq ( Arabic : \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0642 , [ \u0294al.ma\u0283.riq ] ) , meaning the eastern place , where the sun rises . In the 13th and 14th centuries , the term levante was used for Italian maritime commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean , including Greece , Anatolia , Syria-Palestine , and Egypt , that is , the lands east of Venice . Eventually the term was restricted to the Muslim countries of Syria-Palestine and Egypt . In 1581 , England set up the Levant Company to monopolize commerce with the Ottoman Empire . The name Levant States was used to refer to the French mandate over Syria and Lebanon after World War I . This is probably the reason why the term Levant has come to be used more specifically to refer to modern Syria , Lebanon , Palestine , Israel , Jordan , and Cyprus . Some scholars mistakenly believed that it derives from the name of Lebanon . Today the term is often used in conjunction with prehistoric or ancient historical references .",
  "/wiki/Confucianism": "Confucianism , also known as Ruism , is a system of thought and behavior originating in ancient China . Variously described as tradition , a philosophy , a religion , a humanistic or rationalistic religion , a way of governing , or simply a way of life , Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius ( 551-479 BCE ) . Confucius considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang ( c. 1600-1046 BCE ) and Zhou dynasties ( c. 1046-256 BCE ) for the Warring States period . Confucianism was suppressed during the Legalist and autocratic Qin dynasty ( 221-206 BCE ) , but survived . During the Han dynasty ( 206 BCE-220 CE ) , Confucian approaches edged out the proto-Taoist Huang-Lao as the official ideology , while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism . A Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) . In the late Tang , Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism . This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar official class in the Song dynasty ( 960-1297 ) . The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism . The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China 's weaknesses . They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings ; some of these new ideologies include the Three Principles of the People with the establishment of the Republic of China , and then Maoism under the People 's Republic of China . In the late twentieth century Confucian work ethic has been credited with the rise of the East Asian economy .",

Spiritists refer to Kardec as the codifier . Spiritist philosophy postulates that humans , along with all other living beings , are essentially immortal spirits that temporarily inhabit physical bodies for several necessary incarnations to attain moral and intellectual improvement . It also asserts that disembodied spirits , through passive or active mediumship , may have beneficent or malevolent influence on the physical world . Spiritism is an evolution-affirming religion . The term first appeared in Kardec 's book , The Spirits Book , which sought to distinguish Spiritism from spiritualism . Spiritism is currently represented in 35 countries by the International Spiritist Council . It has influenced a social movement of healing centers , charity institutions and hospitals involving millions of people in dozens of countries , with the greatest number of adherents in Brazil .

NRMs can be novel in origin or part of a wider religion , in which case they are distinct from pre-existing denominations . Some NRMs deal with the challenges posed by the modernizing world by embracing individualism , whereas others seek tightly knit collective means . Scholars have estimated that NRMs now number in the tens of thousands worldwide , with most of their members living in Asia and Africa . Most have only a few members , some have thousands , and a few have more than a million members . Scholars continue to try to reach definitions and define boundaries . There is no single , agreed-upon criterion for defining a new religious movement , but the term usually suggests that the group is of recent origin and is different from existing religions . There is debate as to how the term new should be interpreted in this context . One perspective is that it should designate a religion that is more recent in its origins than large , well-established religions like Christianity , Judaism , Islam , and Buddhism . An alternate perspective is that new should mean that a religion is more recent in its formation . Some scholars view the 1950s or the end of the Second World War in 1945 as the defining time , while others look as far back as the founding of the Latter Day Saint movement in 1830 .

When referring specifically to the shamanic practice ( Korean : \ubb34\uc18d , Hanja : \u5deb\u4fd7 ; musog or musok ) , the term Muism ( Hangul : \ubb34\uad50 , Hanja : \u5deb\u654e ; Mugyo or Mukyo , religion of the mu ( shamans ) ) is used . The general word for shaman in Korean is mu ( Hangul : \ubb34 , Hanja : \u5deb ) . In contemporary terminology , they are called mudang ( \ubb34\ub2f9 , \u5deb\u5802 ) if female or baksu if male , although other terms are used locally . [ note 2 ] The Korean word mu is synonymous of the Chinese word wu \u5deb , which defines both male and female shamans . The role of the mudang is to act as intermediary between the spirits or gods and humanity in order to solve hitches in the development of life , through the practice of gut rituals . Central to Korean shamanism is the belief in many different gods , supernatural beings and ancestor worship . The mu are described as chosen persons . ( see : Korean mythology ) Muism is related to Chinese Wuism , Japanese Shinto and to the Siberian , Mongolian , and Manchurian shamanic traditions . According to some scholars , the Korean ancestral king and later mountain god Dangun is related to the north Asian sky god Tengri ( Tian ) ( Heaven ) . Hereditary shamans , who are typical of South Korea , are called tangol ( \ub2f9\uace8 ) or tangur-ari , a word considered related to the Siberian word Tengri ( gods or spirits ) . Mudang are similar to Japanese miko and Ryukyuan yuta .",
  "/wiki/Religion_in_Korea": "Religion in Korea refers the various religious traditions practiced on the Korean peninsula . The oldest indigenous religion of Korea is the Korean folk religion , which has been passed down from prehistory to the present . Buddhism was introduced to Korea from China during the Three Kingdoms era in the 4th century , and the religion flourished until the Joseon Dynasty , when Confucianism became the state religion . During the Late Joseon Dynasty , in the 19th century , Christianity began to gain a foothold in Korea . While both Christianity and Buddhism would play important roles in the resistance to the Japanese occupation of Korea in the first half of the 20th century , only about 4% of Koreans were members of a religious organization in 1940 . Since the division of Korea into two sovereign states in 1945 - North Korea and South Korea - religious life in the two countries has diverged , shaped by different political structures . Religion in South Korea has been characterized by a rise of Christianity and a revival of Buddhism , though the majority of South Koreans have no religious affiliation or follow folk religions . Religion in North Korea is characterized by state atheism in which freedom of religion is nonexistent . Juche ideology , which promotes the North Korean cult of personality , is regarded by experts as a kind of national religion .",
  "/wiki/Korea": "Korea is a region in East Asia consisting of the Korean Peninsula , Jeju Island , and several minor islands near the peninsula . Korea has been divided since 1948 between two distinct sovereign states , North Korea and South Korea . Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast , China to the northwest , and neighbours Japan to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) . During the first half of the 1st millennium , Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo , Baekje , and Silla , together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea . In the second half of the 1st millennium , Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo , leading to the Unified Silla period . Meanwhile , Balhae formed in the north , superseding former Goguryeo . Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war , ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms . Toward the end of the 1st millennium , Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo , which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state . Around the same time , Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo . Goryeo ( also spelled as Kory\u014f ) , whose name developed into the modern exonym Korea , was a highly cultured state that created the world 's first metal movable type in 1234 . However , multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation , which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting . Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo , severe political strife followed , and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye , who established Joseon in July 17 , 1392 .",

It shares its maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand , and the Philippines , Indonesia and Malaysia through the South China Sea . [ n 5 ] Its capital city is Hanoi , while its most populous city is Ho Chi Minh City , also known by its former name of Saigon . Archaeological excavations indicate that Vietnam was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic age . The ancient Vietnamese nation was annexed by China in the 2nd century BC , which subsequently made Vietnam a division of China for over a millennium . The first independent monarchy emerged in the 10th century AD . This paved the way for successive imperial dynasties as the nation expanded geographically southward until the Indochinese Peninsula saw French colonisation in the mid-19th century . Modern Vietnam was born upon the Proclamation of Independence from France in 1945 . Following Vietnamese victory against the French in the First Indochina War , which ended in 1954 , the nation was divided into two rival states : communist North and anti-communist South .

Established by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in 1863 , it initially grew in Persia and parts of the Middle East , where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception . It is estimated to have between 5 and 8 million adherents , known as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds , spread throughout most of the world 's countries and territories . It grew from the mid-19th-century B\u00e1b\u00ed religion , whose founder ( the B\u00e1b ) taught that God would soon send a prophet in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad . In 1863 , after being banished from his native Iran , Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h ( 1817-1892 ) announced that he was this prophet . He was further exiled , spending over a decade in the prison city of Acre in Ottoman Palestine .

Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world annually elect local , regional , and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion , and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice , the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community , which sits in Haifa , Israel , near the Shrine of the B\u00e1b . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths : God is considered single and all-powerful . However , Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history ; Buddha , Jesus , and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose , though varied in social practices and interpretations .

  "/wiki/Jainism": "Jainism ( /\u02c8d\u0292e\u026an\u026az\u0259m/ ) , traditionally known as Jain Dharma , is an ancient Indian religion . Followers of Jainism are called Jains , a word derived from the Sanskrit word jina ( victor ) referring to the path of victory in crossing over life 's stream of rebirths by destroying karma through an ethical and spiritual life . Jainism is a transtheistic religion , and Jains trace their spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as tirthankaras , with the first being Rishabhanatha , who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago , the twenty-third Tirthankara Parshvanatha in 900 BCE , and the twenty-fourth Tirthankara the Mah\u0101v\u012bra around 500 BCE . Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology . Their religious texts are called Agamas . The main religious premises of Jainism are ahi\u1e43s\u0101 ( non-violence ) , anek\u0101ntav\u0101da ( many-sidedness ) , aparigraha ( non-attachment ) and asceticism . Devout Jains take five main vows : ahi\u1e43s\u0101 ( non-violence ) , satya ( truth ) , asteya ( not stealing ) , brahmacharya ( celibacy or chastity or sexual continence ) , and aparigraha ( non-possessiveness ) . These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways , such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles . Parasparopagraho J\u012bv\u0101n\u0101m ( the function of souls is to help one another ) is the motto of Jainism . \u1e46am\u014dk\u0101ra mantra is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism . Jainism has two major ancient sub-traditions , Digambaras and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras ; Several smaller sub-traditions emerged in the 2nd millennium CE . The Digambaras and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras have different views on ascetic practices , gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical .",
