  "/wiki/Duke_of_Buccleuch": "The title Duke of Buccleuch /b\u0259\u02c8klu\u02d0/ , formerly also spelt Duke of Buccleugh , is a title in the Peerage of Scotland created twice on 20 April 1663 , first for James Scott , 1st Duke of Monmouth and second suo jure for his wife Anne Scott , 4th Countess of Buccleuch . Monmouth , the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II was attainted after his 1685 rebellion , but his wife 's title was unaffected and passed on to their descendants , who have successively borne the surnames Scott , Montagu-Scott , Montagu Douglas Scott and Scott again . In 1810 , the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch inherited the Dukedom of Queensberry , also in the Peerage of Scotland , thus separating that title from the Marquessate of Queensberry . The substantial origin of the ducal house of the Scotts of Buccleuch dates back to the large grants of lands in Scotland to Sir Walter Scott of Kirkurd and Buccleuch , a border chief , by James II , in consequence of the fall of William Douglas , 8th Earl of Douglas ( 1452 ) , but the family traced their descent back to a Sir Richard le Scott ( 1240-1285 ) . Sir Walter Scott of Branxholme and Buccleuch ( died 1552 ) distinguished himself at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh ( 1547 ) . His great-grandson Sir Walter was created Lord Scott of Buccleuch in 1606 . Other subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Buccleuch are : Earl of Buccleuch ( 1619 ) , Earl of Dalkeith ( 1663 ) and Lord Scott of Whitchester and Eskdaill ( 1619 ) ( all in the Peerage of Scotland ) . The Duke also holds the two subsidiary titles of the attainted Dukedom of Monmouth , namely Earl of Doncaster ( 1663 ) and Baron Scott of Tindale ( 1663 ) ( both in the Peerage of England ) , and several subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Queensberry , namely Marquess of Dumfriesshire ( 1683 ) , Earl of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar ( 1682 ) , Viscount of Nith , Tortholwald and Ross ( 1682 ) and Lord Douglas of Kilmount , Middlebie and Dornock ( 1682 ) ( all in the Peerage of Scotland ) . The Earldom of Doncaster and Barony of Scott of Tindale had been forfeit at the time of the first Duke 's attainder , but the titles were restored to the 2nd Duke of Buccleuch in 1742 . Until 1835 , the Dukes also held lands in the West Riding of Yorkshire and the ancient title of Lord of Bowland . The Duke of Buccleuch is the hereditary chief of Clan Scott .

The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 .
