  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship , often referred to as a steamer , is a type of steam-powered vessel , typically ocean-faring and seaworthy , that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move ( turn ) propellers or paddlewheels . The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s ; however , there were exceptions that came before . Steamships usually use the prefix designations of PS for paddle steamer or SS for screw steamer ( using a propeller or screw ) . As paddle steamers became less common , SS is assumed by many to stand for steamship . Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as MV for motor vessel , so it is not correct to use SS for most modern vessels . As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns , new trade routes opened up . The steamship has been described as a major driver of the first wave of trade globalization ( 1870-1913 ) and contributor to an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history .",

The monitor was absorbed into the CNF following Federation in 1901 , and was renamed HMAS Cerberus when the navy became the RAN in 1911 . By World War I , Cerberus ' weapons and boilers were inoperable ; the ship served as a guardship and munitions store , while carrying the personnel of the fledgling Royal Australian Naval College on her paybooks . In 1921 , the ship was renamed HMAS Platypus II , and tasked as a submarine tender for the RAN 's six J-class submarines . In 1924 , the monitor was sold for scrap , and was sunk as a breakwater off Half Moon Bay . The wreck became a popular site for scuba diving and picnics over the years , but there was a structural collapse in 1993 .

The bay is surrounded mostly by metropolitan Greater Melbourne in its main eastern portion , and the city of Greater Geelong in the much smaller western portion north of the Bellarine Peninsula . Geographically , the bay covers 1,930 square kilometres ( 480,000 acres ) and the shore stretches roughly 264 km ( 164 mi ) . Although it is extremely shallow for its size , most of the bay is navigable . The deepest portion is only 24 metres ( 79 ft ) , and half the region is shallower than 8 m ( 26 ft ) . The volume of the water in the port is around 25 cubic kilometres ( 6.0 cu mi ) . Before European settlement the area around Port Phillip was divided between the territories of the Wathaurong ( to the west ) , Wurundjeri ( north ) and Boonwurrung ( south and east ) Nations . Its waters and coast are home to seals , whales , dolphins , corals , and many kinds of seabirds and migratory waders . The first Europeans to enter the bay were the crews of HMS Lady Nelson , commanded by John Murray and , ten weeks later , HMS Investigator commanded by Matthew Flinders , in 1802 . Subsequent expeditions into the bay took place in 1803 to establish the first settlement in Victoria , near Sorrento , but was abandoned in 1804 . Thirty years later , settlers from Tasmania returned to establish Melbourne , now the state 's capital city , at the mouth of the Yarra River in 1835 and Geelong at Corio Bay in 1838 .

  "/wiki/Torpedo_boat": "A torpedo boat is a relatively small and fast naval ship designed to carry torpedoes into battle . The first designs rammed enemy ships with explosive spar torpedoes , and later designs launched self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes . They were created to counter battleships and other slow and heavily armed ships by using speed , agility , and the power of their torpedo weapons . A number of inexpensive torpedo boats attacking en masse could overwhelm a larger ship 's ability to fight them off using its large but cumbersome guns . An inexpensive fleet of torpedo boats could pose a threat to much larger and more expensive fleets of capital ships , albeit only in the coastal areas to which their small size and limited fuel load restricted them . The introduction of fast torpedo boats in the late 19th century was a serious concern to the era 's naval strategists . In response , navies operating large ships introduced smaller ships to counter torpedo boats , mounting light quick-firing guns . These ships , which came to be called torpedo boat destroyers and later simply destroyers , became larger and took on more roles , making torpedo attacks as well as defending against them , and eventually defending against submarines and aircraft . The destroyer eventually became the predominant type of surface warship in the guided missile age . In the modern era , the old concept of a very small , fast , and cheap surface combatant with powerful offensive weapons is taken up by the fast attack craft .",

  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia .

Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia .
