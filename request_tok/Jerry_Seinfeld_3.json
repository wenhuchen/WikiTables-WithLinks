  "/wiki/The_Seinfeld_Chronicles": "The Seinfeld Chronicles ( also known as Good News , Bad News or Pilot ) is the pilot episode of the American sitcom Seinfeld , which first aired on NBC on July 5 , 1989 . The first of the 180 Seinfeld episodes , the pilot was written by show creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld , and directed by Art Wolff . The episode revolves around a fictionalized version of Seinfeld , who is unsure about the romantic intentions of a woman he met , and frets about the meaning of her signals with his friend George ( Jason Alexander ) and neighbor Kessler ( Michael Richards , whose character would later be renamed Kramer ) . Though they had been asked to put together a 90-minute TV special , Seinfeld and David wrote a TV pilot as they felt their show about nothing concept would fit better in the shorter , more conventional half-hour format . The storyline , and the main characters , were inspired by real-life events and people . Though the NBC executives were unsure about the show , they , as Warren Littlefield would later state , all said , ah what the hell , let 's try a pilot on this thing and see what happens . The test audiences , however , reacted extremely negatively . Although NBC would still broadcast the episode to see how audiences and TV critics would react , the network had already decided not to pick up the show , as a result of the test results . Castle Rock Entertainment , which produced this pilot ( and the series proper ) , also had another pilot produced for NBC featuring actress Ann Jillian in her own eponymous series . After the poor reception of The Seinfeld Chronicles , the production company turned to Jillian 's series , which tested better and had earned a full-season order ; it would only last a single 13-episode season before being cancelled by the end of 1990 . When The Seinfeld Chronicles aired , it was watched by nearly 11% of American households , and received generally favorable reviews from critics , who reacted with disappointment that NBC did not order a first season . Convinced that the show had potential , and supported by the positive reviews , NBC executive Rick Ludwin managed to convince his superiors to order a four-episode first season ( the smallest order in US TV history ) , by offering a part of his personal budget in return .",
