  "/wiki/Manhattan_Project": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons . It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada . From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $ 2 billion ( about $ 23 billion in 2018 dollars ) . Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada . Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war : a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon . The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium , and therefore a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235 , an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium . Chemically identical to the most common isotope , uranium-238 , and with almost the same mass , it proved difficult to separate the two .",

  "/wiki/Yerkes_Observatory": "Yerkes Observatory ( /\u02c8j\u025c\u02d0rki\u02d0z/ YUR-kees ) is an astronomical observatory in Williams Bay , Wisconsin owned by the University of Chicago Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics . The observatory , sometimes called the birthplace of modern astrophysics , was founded in 1897 by astronomer George Ellery Hale and financed by businessman Charles T. Yerkes . It represented a shift in the thinking about observatories , from their being mere housing for telescopes and observers , to the early-20th-century concept of observation equipment integrated with laboratory space for physics and chemistry . The observatory ceased operations in 2018 . The observatory houses a 40-inch ( 102-cm ) diameter doublet lens refracting telescope , the largest ever successfully used for astronomy , and a collection of over 170,000 photographic plates . The Yerkes was the second largest telescope in world when it was lit up , the other larger one was the Paris Observatory 's 122 cm reflector . During this time , there were many questions about the merits of the various materials used to construct telescopes . Another large telescope of this period was the Great Melbourne Telescope , which offered strong competition in this time period to the glass and lens telescopes . In the United States , the Lick refractor had just come online in California with a 91 cm lens , and a larger lens was within reach . In 1893 , the enormous German equatorial mount for the Yerkes refractor was shown at the Columbian Exhibition in Chicago , meanwhile Hale also coordinated construction of an observatory campus in Wisconsin with the University of Chicago . The observatory was a center for serious astronomical research for more than 100 years . However , by the 21st century , it had reached the end of its research life .",

For his contributions to the team that developed this process , Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1960 . A 1927 chemistry graduate of the University of California , Berkeley , from which he received his doctorate in 1933 , he studied radioactive elements and developed sensitive Geiger counters to measure weak natural and artificial radioactivity . During World War II he worked in the Manhattan Project 's Substitute Alloy Materials ( SAM ) Laboratories at Columbia University , developing the gaseous diffusion process for uranium enrichment . After the war , Libby accepted professorship at the University of Chicago 's Institute for Nuclear Studies , where he developed the technique for dating organic compounds using carbon-14 . He also discovered that tritium similarly could be used for dating water , and therefore wine . In 1950 , he became a member of the General Advisory Committee ( GAC ) of the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) . He was appointed a commissioner in 1954 , becoming its sole scientist . He sided with Edward Teller on pursuing a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb , participated in the Atoms for Peace program , and defended the administration 's atmospheric nuclear testing .

His work in this area also led to his development of the actinide concept and the arrangement of the actinide series in the periodic table of the elements . Seaborg spent most of his career as an educator and research scientist at the University of California , Berkeley , serving as a professor , and , between 1958 and 1961 , as the university 's second chancellor . He advised ten US Presidents - from Harry S. Truman to Bill Clinton - on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 to 1971 , where he pushed for commercial nuclear energy and the peaceful applications of nuclear science . Throughout his career , Seaborg worked for arms control . He was a signatory to the Franck Report and contributed to the Limited Test Ban Treaty , the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty . He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research . Toward the end of the Eisenhower administration , he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science , and , as a member of President Ronald Reagan 's National Commission on Excellence in Education , he was a key contributor to its 1983 report A Nation at Risk . Seaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements : plutonium , americium , curium , berkelium , californium , einsteinium , fermium , mendelevium , nobelium and element 106 , which , while he was still living , was named seaborgium in his honor . He also discovered more than 100 isotopes of transuranium elements and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium , originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the second atomic bomb . Early in his career , he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases , including iodine-131 , which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease . In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept , which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table , he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series .",
  "/wiki/Harold_Urey": "Harold Clayton Urey ( April 29 , 1893 - January 5 , 1981 ) was an American physical chemist whose pioneering work on isotopes earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 for the discovery of deuterium . He played a significant role in the development of the atom bomb , as well as contributing to theories on the development of organic life from non-living matter . Born in Walkerton , Indiana , Urey studied thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis at the University of California , Berkeley . After he received his PhD in 1923 , he was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen . He was a research associate at Johns Hopkins University before becoming an associate professor of Chemistry at Columbia University . In 1931 , he began work with the separation of isotopes that resulted in the discovery of deuterium . During World War II , Urey turned his knowledge of isotope separation to the problem of uranium enrichment . He headed the group located at Columbia University that developed isotope separation using gaseous diffusion . The method was successfully developed , becoming the sole method used in the early post-war period . After the war , Urey became professor of chemistry at the Institute for Nuclear Studies , and later Ryerson professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago . Urey speculated that the early terrestrial atmosphere was composed of ammonia , methane , and hydrogen . One of his Chicago graduate students was Stanley L. Miller , who showed in the Miller-Urey experiment that , if such a mixture were exposed to electric sparks and water , it can interact to produce amino acids , commonly considered the building blocks of life ."
