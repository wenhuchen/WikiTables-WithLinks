Beckett earned a Ph.D. degree in statistics at Southern Methodist University in 1975 and then joined the faculty of Bowling Green State University as an Associate Professor . While at Bowling Green , Beckett began preparing baseball card price guides , which he offered free upon request . Beckett price guides rely upon information from sellers throughout the United States , who supply information on customer interest and sales of products . Price guides typically carry two value labels , one based upon a high value , the other denoting low values . As the condition of collectibles is important in ascertaining their value , Beckett price guides also typically include a series of definitions for estimating condition . In November 1984 , Beckett began publishing Beckett Baseball Card Monthly . Rival publication Tuff Stuff was also founded that year . Beckett Baseball Card Monthly grew in popularity and became the basis for the success of Beckett Media , now based in Dallas , Texas . Beckett Publications produces price guides for a variety of sports collectibles and tracks market values for non-sports card collectibles ( Beckett 's Football , Basketball , and Hockey guides would start in the early 1990s , with Beckett 's monthly Racing Guide following in 1996 ) , such as Pok\u00e9mon Cards and related products .

The term White House is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers . The residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the neoclassical style . Hoban modelled the building on Leinster House in Dublin , a building which today houses the Oireachtas , the Irish legislature . Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white . When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801 , he ( with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe ) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage . In 1814 , during the War of 1812 , the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington , destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior . Reconstruction began almost immediately , and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817 . Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829 . Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself , President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901 . Eight years later in 1909 , President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office , which was eventually moved as the section was expanded .",
