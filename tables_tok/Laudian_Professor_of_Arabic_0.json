        "Pococke started studying Arabic with William Bedwell in 1625 , and became chaplain to the Levant Company in Aleppo ( in modern-day Syria ) in 1630 to improve his knowledge further . He returned in 1636 at the request of William Laud , who had decided to make Pococke the first appointment to the chair . Thomas Greaves was Pococke 's deputy between 1637 and 1641 when Pococke travelled to Constantinople for research and to collect manuscripts . Pococke was appointed Regius Professor of Hebrew in 1648 , but his refusal to promise loyalty to the Commonwealth of England led to the parliamentary committee supervising the university to order his removal from both professorships . However , the committee was persuaded to stay the order until a replacement could be found , and it was never implemented . Pococke has been described as the finest European Arabist of his time ... and among the greatest of all time",

His interest in oriental languages came from his father , a rector in Shropshire . He is described in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as a mediocre orientalist , who carried out little teaching despite having significant linguistic skills . He had a strong intellectual interest in oriental languages and peoples , although his inability to finish work meant that he published little .

  "intro": "The position of Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford was established in 1636 by William Laud, who at the time was Chancellor of the University of Oxford and Archbishop of Canterbury. The first professor was Edward Pococke, who was working as a chaplain in Aleppo in what is now Syria when Laud asked him to return to Oxford to take up the position. Laud's regulations for the professorship required lectures on Arabic grammar and literature to be delivered weekly during university vacations and Lent. He also provided that the professor's lectures were to be attended by all medical students and Bachelors of Arts at the university, although this seems not to have happened since Pococke had few students, despite the provision for non-attenders to be fined. In 1881, a university statute repealed Laud's regulations and provided that the professor was to lecture in the Arabic, Syriac, and Chaldee Languages, and attached the professorship to a fellowship at St John's College. The standard of the professors has varied. The second professor, Thomas Hyde, is described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as a mediocre orientalist, and one history of the university says of the third professor, John Wallis, that not only did [he] give no lectures for most of his long tenure, but he did nothing to advance knowledge either. Pococke, Joseph White, Sir Hamilton Gibb, and Alfred Beeston have received high praise for their scholarship. David Margoliouth (professor 1889-1937) taught the syllabus for the final examinations in lectures over two years, forcing some students to tackle the more difficult texts in their first year of study. Successive professors had few students until after the Second World War, when numbers increased because of the reputation of the then professor, Gibb, and because some British students became interested in Arabic culture while serving in the Middle East during the war. Julia Bray, the Laudian Professor as of 2015[update], was appointed in 2012 and is the first woman to hold the position. She is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, based at the Oriental Institute."
