  "/wiki/Scientific_name": "Binomial nomenclature ( two-term naming system ) , also called binominal nomenclature ( two-name naming system ) or binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts , both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages . Such a name is called a binomial name ( which may be shortened to just binomial ) , a binomen , binominal name or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name - the generic name - identifies the genus to which the species belongs , while the second part - the specific name or specific epithet - identifies the species within the genus . For example , humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . Tyrannosaurus rex is probably the most widely known binomial . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753 . But Gaspard Bauhin , in as early as 1622 , had introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici ( English , Illustrated exposition of plants ) many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus . The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules , of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICNafp ) . Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes , there are some differences , both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules . In modern usage , the first letter of the first part of the name , the genus , is always capitalized in writing , while that of the second part is not , even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place . Similarly , both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text ( or underlined in handwriting ) . Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox ( named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii .",
  "/wiki/Common_name": "In biology , a common name of a taxon or organism ; also known as a vernacular name ( local name ) , English name , colloquial name , trivial name , trivial epithet , country name , popular name , or farmer 's name ; is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life ; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism , which is Latinized . A common name is sometimes frequently used , but that is by no means always the case . Sometimes common names are created by authorities on one particular subject , in an attempt to make it possible for members of the general public ( including such interested parties as fishermen , farmers , etc . ) to be able to refer to one particular species of organism without needing to be able to memorise or pronounce the Latinized scientific name . Creating an official list of common names can also be an attempt to standardize the use of common names , which can sometimes vary a great deal between one part of a country and another , as well as between one country and another country , even where the same language is spoken in both places .",

  "/wiki/Scleractinia": "Scleractinia , also called stony corals or hard corals , are marine animals in the phylum Cnidaria that build themselves a hard skeleton . The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc in which a mouth is fringed with tentacles . Although some species are solitary , most are colonial . The founding polyp settles and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body . Solitary corals can be as much as 25 cm ( 10 in ) across but in colonial species the polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter . These polyps reproduce asexually by budding , but remain attached to each other , forming a multi-polyp colony of clones with a common skeleton , which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species . The shape and appearance of each coral colony depends not only on the species , but also on its location , depth , the amount of water movement and other factors . Many shallow-water corals contain symbiont unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues . These give their colour to the coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of symbiont it contains . Stony corals are closely related to sea anemones , and like them are armed with stinging cells known as cnidocytes . Corals reproduce both sexually and asexually . Most species release gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place , and the planula larvae drift as part of the plankton , but a few species brood their eggs .",

  "/wiki/Chiroptera": "Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera ; [ a ] with their forelimbs adapted as wings , they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight . Bats are more manoeuvrable than birds , flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium . The smallest bat , and arguably the smallest extant mammal , is Kitti 's hog-nosed bat , which is 29-34 mm ( 1.14-1.34 in ) in length , 15 cm ( 5.91 in ) across the wings and 2-2.6 g ( 0.07-0.09 oz ) in mass . The largest bats are the flying foxes and the giant golden-crowned flying fox , Acerodon jubatus , which can weigh 1.6 kg ( 4 lb ) and have a wingspan of 1.7 m ( 5 ft 7 in ) . The second largest order of mammals after rodents , bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide , with over 1,200 species . These were traditionally divided into two suborders : the largely fruit-eating megabats , and the echolocating microbats . But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera , with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats . Many bats are insectivores , and most of the rest are frugivores ( fruit-eaters ) . A few species feed on animals other than insects ; for example , the vampire bats feed on blood . Most bats are nocturnal , and many roost in caves or other refuges ; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators . Bats are present throughout the world , with the exception of extremely cold regions . They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds ; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services .",

Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers ( 3,700,000 sq mi ) , it is the third largest country by area . [ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .

Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",
  "/wiki/Passeriformes": "A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes , which includes more than half of all bird species .

  "/wiki/Rodentia": "Rodents ( from Latin Rodere , to gnaw ) are mammals of the order Rodentia , which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws . About 40% of all mammal species are rodents ( 2,277 species ) ; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica . They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats , including human-made environments . Species can be arboreal , fossorial ( burrowing ) , or semiaquatic . Well-known rodents include mice , rats , squirrels , prairie dogs , chipmunks , chinchillas , porcupines , beavers , guinea pigs , hamsters , gerbils and capybaras . Rabbits , hares , and pikas , whose incisors also grow continually , were once included with them , but are now considered to be in a separate order , the Lagomorpha . Nonetheless , Rodentia and Lagomorpha are sister groups , sharing a single common ancestor and forming the clade of Glires . Most rodents are small animals with robust bodies , short limbs , and long tails . They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food , excavate burrows , and defend themselves . Most eat seeds or other plant material , but some have more varied diets . They tend to be social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other . Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy , to polygyny , to promiscuity .",
  "/wiki/Aonyx_cinerea": "The Asian small-clawed otter ( Amblonyx cinereus ) , also known as the oriental small-clawed otter or simply small-clawed otter , is a semiaquatic mammal native to South and Southeast Asia . It is a member of the otter subfamily ( Lutrinae ) of the weasel family ( Mustelidae ) , and is the smallest otter species in the world . Its paws are a distinctive feature ; its claws do not extend beyond the fleshy end pads of its partially webbed fingers and toes . This gives it a high degree of manual dexterity so that it can use its paws to feed on molluscs , crabs and other small aquatic animals . The Asian small-clawed otter inhabits mangrove swamps and freshwater wetlands in South and Southeast Asia . It lives in extended family groups with only the alpha pair breeding ; offspring from previous years help to raise the young . Due to ongoing habitat loss , pollution , and hunting in some areas , it is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List .",

  "/wiki/South_Asia": "South Asia or Southern Asia , is the southern region of the Asian continent , which comprises the sub-Himalayan SAARC countries and , for some authorities , adjoining countries to the west and east . Topographically , it is dominated by the Indian Plate , which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush . South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land ( clockwise , from west ) by Western Asia , Central Asia , East Asia and Southeast Asia . The current territories of Afghanistan , Bangladesh , Bhutan , Maldives , Nepal , India , Pakistan and Sri Lanka form South Asia . The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) is an economic cooperation organisation in the region which was established in 1985 and includes all eight nations comprising South Asia . South Asia covers about 5.2 million km2 ( 2 million mi2 ) , which is 11.71% of the Asian continent or 3.5% of the world 's land surface area . The population of South Asia is about 1.891 billion or about one fourth of the world 's population , making it both the most populous and the most densely populated geographical region in the world . Overall , it accounts for about 39.49% of Asia 's population , over 24% of the world 's population , and is home to a vast array of people . In 2010 , South Asia had the world 's largest populations of Hindus , Muslims , Sikhs , Jains and Zoroastrians .

  "/wiki/Carnivora": "Carnivora ( /k\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8n\u026av\u0259r\u0259/ ; ; from Latin car\u014d ( stem carn- ) flesh and vor\u0101re to devour ) is a diverse scrotiferan order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals . Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans , whereas the word carnivore ( often popularly applied to members of this group ) can refer to any meat-eating organism . Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order , ranging from the least weasel ( Mustela nivalis ) , at as little as 25 g ( 0.88 oz ) and 11 cm ( 4.3 in ) , to the polar bear ( Ursus maritimus ) , which can weigh up to 1,000 kg ( 2,200 lb ) , to the southern elephant seal ( Mirounga leonina ) , whose adult males weigh up to 5,000 kg ( 11,000 lb ) and measure up to 6.7 m ( 22 ft ) in length . Carnivorans have teeth and claws adapted for catching and eating other animals . Many hunt in packs and are social animals , giving them an advantage over larger prey . Some carnivorans , such as cats and pinnipeds , depend entirely on meat for their nutrition . Others , such as raccoons and bears , are more omnivorous , depending on the habitat . The giant panda is largely a herbivore , but also feeds on fish , eggs , and insects . The polar bear subsists mainly on seals . Carnivorans are split into two suborders : Feliformia ( catlike ) and Caniformia ( doglike ) . Approximately 160 species of carnivorans belong to the caniformia suborder and 120 to the feliformia suborder .",
