  "/wiki/Parliamentary_system": "A parliamentary system or parliamentary democracy is a system of democratic governance of a state ( or subordinate entity ) where the executive derives its democratic legitimacy from its ability to command the confidence of the legislature , typically a parliament , and is also held accountable to that parliament . In a parliamentary system , the head of state is usually a person distinct from the head of government . This is in contrast to a presidential system , where the head of state often is also the head of government and , most importantly , the executive does not derive its democratic legitimacy from the legislature . Countries with parliamentary democracies may be constitutional monarchies , where a monarch is the head of state while the head of government is almost always a member of parliament ( such as Thailand , the United Kingdom , Denmark , Sweden , and Japan ) , or parliamentary republics , where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state while the head of government is regularly from the legislature ( such as Ireland , Germany , India , and Italy ) . In a few parliamentary republics , such as Botswana , South Africa , and Suriname , among some others , the head of government is also head of state , but is elected by and is answerable to parliament . In bicameral parliaments , the head of government is generally , though not always , a member of the lower house . Parliamentarianism is the dominant form of government in Europe , with 32 of its 50 sovereign states being parliamentarian . It is also common in the Caribbean , being the form of government of 10 of its 13 island states , and in Oceania . Elsewhere in the world , parliamentary countries are less common , but they are distributed through all continents , most often in former colonies of the British Empire that subscribe to a particular brand of parliamentarianism known as the Westminster system .",

  "/wiki/Presidential_system": "A presidential system is a democratic and republican government in which a head of government leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch . This head of government is in most cases also the head of state , which is called president . In presidential countries , the executive is elected and is not responsible to the legislature , which can not in normal circumstances dismiss it . Such dismissal is possible , however , in uncommon cases , often through impeachment . The title president has persisted from a time when such person personally presided over the governing body , as with the President of the Continental Congress in the early United States , prior to the executive function being split into a separate branch of government . A presidential system contrasts with a parliamentary system , where the head of government is elected to power through the legislative . There is also a hybrid system called semi-presidentialism . Countries that feature a presidential or semi-presidential system of government are not the exclusive users of the title of president . Heads of state of parliamentary republics , largely ceremonial in most cases , are called presidents . Dictators or leaders of one-party states , popularly elected or not , are also often called presidents . Presidentialism is the dominant form of government in the continental Americas , with all of its 22 sovereign states being presidential republics ( except for Canada , Belize and Suriname ) . It is also prevalent in Central and southern West Africa and in Central Asia .",
