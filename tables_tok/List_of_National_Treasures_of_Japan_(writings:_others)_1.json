  "section_title": "Treasures -- Buddhist writings",
  "section_text": "Nara period Buddhism was dominated by six state-controlled sects . They were introduced from the mainland and centred around the ancient capitals in Asuka and Nara . These schools were generally academic in nature , closely connected with the court and represented a doctrine that was far removed from the daily life of the people . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] In 804 , two Japanese monks K\u016bkai and Saich\u014d travelled to China ; on their return they established Tendai and Shingon Buddhism respectively . Unlike their predecessors both esoteric schools took into account the needs of the common people . Though their origins lay in China , with time they acquired local Japanese traits . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Generally the 9th century was a time when Chinese learning thrived in Japan . Authors produced a wide variety of works in Chinese language , including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects . [ 64 ] A number of new sects appeared in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mapp\u014d . [ nb 7 ] [ 65 ] Growing out of an Amida cult , the J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran , and attracted a following from all classes and occupations . [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Three years later , D\u014dgen introduced the S\u014dt\u014d school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice . [ 68 ] The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to Nichiren 's proclamation of his teachings in 1253 . Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant . [ 65 ] The central focus of Nichiren 's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra . [ 65 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Fourteen treatises and commentaries of famous Japanese monks dating from the early Heian to the Kamakura period have been designated as National Treasures . These include three commentaries by K\u016bkai on two of the main mantras ( Dainichiky\u014d and Kong\u014dhannyaky\u014d ) of Shingon Buddhism , works by Shinran discussing Pure Land Buddhism , mapp\u014d and Amida , a manual on zazen `` seated meditation '' by D\u014dgen and two works by Nichiren related to his teachings . In addition two large scale collection of documents from the Nara to the Meiji period are listed here as National Treasures . [ 4 ]",
  "uid": "List_of_National_Treasures_of_Japan_(writings:_others)_1",
  "intro": "The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897,\nalthough the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The written materials in the list adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value. The list presents 104 entries from the Western Wei dynasty to the Meiji period with most dating to the period of Classical Japan and Mid-Imperial China from the 7th to 14th century. The total number of items is higher, however, since groups of related objects have been joined as single entries. The list contains various types of written materials such as sutra copies, Buddhist commentaries and teachings, poetry and letters. Some of the designated objects originated in China, and were imported at a time when writing was being introduced to Japan. The items in this list were predominantly made with a writing brush on manuscript scrolls, which was the preferred medium until the advent of commercial printing and publishing in the 17th century. In many cases the manuscripts are noted examples of calligraphy. They are housed in temples, museums, libraries or archives, shrines, universities and in private collections. The writings in this list represent about half of the 228 National Treasures in the category writings. They are complemented by 68 Japanese and 56 Chinese book National Treasures of the List of National Treasures of Japan (writings: Japanese books) and the List of National Treasures of Japan (writings: Chinese books)."
