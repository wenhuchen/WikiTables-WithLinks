The stadium also hosted the 1992-94 FIRA Trophy match between Spain and Romania in 1994 . Plans to build a new stadium in Zaragoza have been abandoned .

Works for the enlargement of La Romareda into a 43,000-seat stadium were due to begin on April 17 , 2006 and end in time for the Zaragoza Expo of 2008 . However , a lawsuit was filed by a political party ( PAR ) , claiming that the enlargement of the stadium would be to the detriment of the population , in order to suspend the planned works .",

Additionally , women were now allowed to compete for the first time in equestrian events .

This leads to the name designation of each event . For example , C-1 is a canoe singles event and K-2 is a kayak doubles event . Races are usually 500 metres or 1000 metres long , although there were also 10 km events from 1936 to 1956 .

  "/wiki/Lake_Albano": "Lake Albano ( Italian : Lago Albano or Lago di Castel Gandolfo ) is a small volcanic crater lake in the Alban Hills of Lazio , at the foot of Monte Cavo , 20 km ( 12 mi ) southeast of Rome . Castel Gandolfo , overlooking the lake , is the site of the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo . In Roman times it was known as Albanus Lacus and lay not far from the ancient city of Alba Longa . With a depth of about 170 m ( 560 ft ) , Lake Albano is the deepest in Lazio . The lake is 3.5 km ( 2.2 mi ) long by 2.3 km ( 1.4 mi ) wide , and was formed by the overlapping union of two volcanic craters , an origin indicated by the ridge in its center , which rises to a height of 70 m ( 230 ft ) . Plutarch reports that in 406 BC the lake surged over the surrounding hills , despite there being no rain nor tributaries flowing into the lake to account for the rise in water level . The ensuing flood destroyed fields and vineyards before eventually pouring into the sea . It is thought to have been caused by volcanic gases , trapped in sediment at the bottom of the lake and gradually building up until suddenly releasing , causing the water to overflow . Around 395 BC , during the wars between Rome and Veii , a discharge tunnel was built crossing the crater walls . It served as an emissary whenever the water level overflowed its mouth . According to Titus Livius , this feat of engineering was incited by the Oracle of Delphi : the Roman victory against Veii would be possible only when the lake waters were channeled and used for irrigation . The emissary is at 293 meters over the sea level .",

The Corps of Engineers has responsibilities to regulate flow for flood control and water use . In addition , it has to ensure that water is available to fulfill such federal mandates as under the Endangered Species Act , to support downstream species .

Le Havre is the most populous commune of Upper Normandy , although the total population of the greater Le Havre conurbation is smaller than that of Rouen . After Reims , it is also the second largest subprefecture in France . The name Le Havre means the harbour or the port . Its inhabitants are known as Havrais or Havraises . The city and port were founded by King Francis I in 1517 . Economic development in the Early modern period was hampered by religious wars , conflicts with the English , epidemics , and storms . It was from the end of the 18th century that Le Havre started growing and the port took off first with the slave trade then other international trade . After the 1944 bombings the firm of Auguste Perret began to rebuild the city in concrete . The oil , chemical , and automotive industries were dynamic during the Trente Glorieuses ( postwar boom ) but the 1970s marked the end of the golden age of ocean liners and the beginning of the economic crisis : the population declined , unemployment increased and remains at a high level today .
