  "/wiki/Seymouriamorph": "Seymouriamorpha were a small but widespread group of limbed vertebrates ( tetrapods ) . They have long been considered reptiliomorphs , and most paleontologists may still accept this point of view , but some analyses suggest that seymouriamorphs are stem-tetrapods ( not more closely related to Amniota than to Lissamphibia ) . Many seymouriamorphs were terrestrial or semi-aquatic . However , aquatic larvae bearing external gills and grooves from the lateral line system have been found , making them unquestionably amphibians . The adults were terrestrial . They ranged from lizard-sized creatures ( 30 centimeters ) to crocodile-sized 150 centimeter long animals . They were reptile-like . If seymouriamorphs are reptiliomorphs , they were the distant relatives of amniotes . Seymouriamorphs form into three main groups , Kotlassiidae , Discosauriscidae , and Seymouriidae , a group that includes the best known genus , Seymouria . The last seymouriamorph became extinct by the end of Permian .",
  "/wiki/Seymouria_sanjuanensis": "Seymouria is an extinct genus of reptile-like tetrapods from the Early Permian of North America and Europe . Although they were amphibians ( in a biological sense ) , Seymouria were well-adapted to life on land , with many reptilian features - so many , in fact , that Seymouria was first thought to be a primitive reptile . It is primarily known from two species , Seymouria baylorensis and Seymouria sanjuanensis . The type species , S. baylorensis , is more robust and specialized , though its fossils have only been found in Texas . On the other hand , Seymouria sanjuanensis is more abundant and widespread . This smaller species is known from multiple well-preserved fossils , including a block of six skeletons found in the Cutler Formation of New Mexico , and a pair of fully grown skeletons from the Tambach Formation of Germany , which were fossilized lying next to each other . For the first half of the 20th century , Seymouria was considered one of the oldest and most primitive known reptiles . Paleontologists noted how the general body shape resembled that of early reptiles such as captorhinids , and that certain adaptations of the limbs , hip , and skull were also similar to that of early reptiles , rather than any species of modern or extinct amphibians known at the time . The strongly-built limbs and backbone also supported the idea that Seymouria was primarily terrestrial , spending very little time in the water . However , in the 1950s , fossilized tadpoles were discovered in Discosauriscus , which was a close relative of Seymouria in the group Seymouriamorpha . This shows that seymouriamorphs ( including Seymouria ) had a larval stage which lived in the water , therefore making Seymouria not a true reptile , but rather an amphibian which was closely related to reptiles . Though no longer considered the most primitive reptile , Seymouria is still an important transitional fossil documenting the acquisition of reptile-like skeletal features prior to the evolution of the amniotic egg , which characterizes amniotes ( reptiles , mammals , and birds ) .",

  "/wiki/Skull": "The skull is a bony structure that forms the head in vertebrates . It supports the structures of the face and provides a protective cavity for the brain . The skull is composed of two parts : the cranium and the mandible . In humans , these two parts are the neurocranium and the viscerocranium or facial skeleton that includes the mandible as its largest bone . The skull forms the anterior most portion of the skeleton and is a product of cephalisation - housing the brain , and several sensory structures such as the eyes , ears , nose , and mouth . In humans these sensory structures are part of the facial skeleton . Functions of the skull include protection of the brain , fixing the distance between the eyes to allow stereoscopic vision , and fixing the position of the ears to enable sound localisation of the direction and distance of sounds . In some animals such as horned ungulates , the skull also has a defensive function by providing the mount ( on the frontal bone ) for the horns . The English word skull is probably derived from Old Norse skulle , while the Latin word cranium comes from the Greek root \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd ( kranion ) . The skull is made up of a number of fused flat bones , and contains many foramina , fossae , processes , and several cavities or sinuses . In zoology there are openings in the skull called fenestrae .",
  "/wiki/Amphibamiform": "Amphibamiformes is an unranked clade with Dissorophoidea created by Schoch ( 2019 ) . It encompasses all of the taxa traditionally considered to be amphibamids ( subsequently restricted to Doleserpeton annectens and Amphibamus grandiceps by Schoch ) , branchiosaurids , and hypothetically lissamphibians under the traditional temnospondyl hypothesis of lissamphibian origins . These taxa are typically small-bodied dissorophoids and form the sister group to Olsoniformes , which comprises dissorophids and trematopids .",
  "/wiki/Dissorophoidea": "Dissorophoideans are a clade of medium-sized , temnospondyl amphibians that appeared during the Moscovian in Euramerica , and continued through to the Late Permian and the Early Triassic of Gondwana . They are distinguished by various details of the skull , and many forms seem to have been well adapted for life on land . Since 2008 , Lissamphibia has been progressively widely considered part of this clade . It is possible that the small Permo-Carboniferous Micromelerpetontidae and the large Late Permian Melosauridae may also belong in this clade .",
  "/wiki/Temnospondyl": "Temnospondyli ( from Greek \u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( temnein , to cut ) and \u03c3\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ( spondylos , vertebra ) ) is a diverse order of small to giant tetrapods - often considered primitive amphibians - that flourished worldwide during the Carboniferous , Permian , and Triassic periods . A few species continued into the Cretaceous . Fossils have been found on every continent . During about 210 million years of evolutionary history , they adapted to a wide range of habitats , including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal marine environments . Their life history is well understood , with fossils known from the larval stage , metamorphosis , and maturity . Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to breed . These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land . Although temnospondyls are considered amphibians , many had characteristics , such as scales , claws , and armour-like bony plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians . Temnospondyls have been known since the early 19th century , and were initially thought to be reptiles . They were described at various times as batrachians , stegocephalians , and labyrinthodonts , although these names are now rarely used . Animals now grouped in Temnospondyli were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century , when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae . Temnospondyli means cut vertebrae , as each vertebra is divided into several parts .",

  "/wiki/Tetrapod": "Tetrapods ( /\u02c8t\u025btr\u0259p\u0252d/ ; from Greek : \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1- four and \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 foot ) are four-limbed ( with a few exceptions , such as snakes ) animals constituting the superclass Tetrapoda . It includes extant and extinct amphibians , reptiles ( including dinosaurs and therefore birds ) , and mammals . Tetrapods evolved from a group of animals known as the Tetrapodomorpha which , in turn , evolved from ancient Sarcopterygii ( lobe-finned fishes ) around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian period ; their forms were transitional between lobe-finned fishes and the four-limbed tetrapods . The first tetrapods ( from a traditional , apomorphy-based perspective ) appeared by the late Devonian , 367.5 million years ago ; the specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods , and the process by which they colonized Earth 's land after emerging from water remains unclear . The change from a body plan for breathing and navigating in water to a body plan enabling the animal to move on land is one of the most profound evolutionary changes known . The first tetrapods were primarily aquatic . Modern amphibians , which evolved from earlier groups , are generally semiaquatic ; the first stage of their lives is as fish-like tadpoles , and later stages are partly terrestrial and partly aquatic . However , most tetrapod species today are amniotes , most of those are terrestrial tetrapods whose branch evolved from earlier tetrapods about 340 million years ago ( crown amniotes evolved 318 million years ago ) . The key innovation in amniotes over amphibians is laying of eggs on land or having further evolved to retain the fertilized egg ( s ) within the mother . Amniote tetrapods began to dominate and drove most amphibian tetrapods to extinction . One group of amniotes diverged into the reptiles , which includes lepidosaurs , dinosaurs ( which includes birds ) , crocodilians , turtles , and extinct relatives ; while another group of amniotes diverged into the mammals and their extinct relatives . Amniotes include the tetrapods that further evolved for flight - such as birds from among the dinosaurs , and bats from among the mammals .",

  "/wiki/Mandible": "The mandible , lower jaw or jawbone is the largest , strongest and lowest bone in the human face . It forms the lower jaw and holds the lower teeth in place . The mandible sits beneath the maxilla . It is the only movable bone of the skull ( discounting the ossicles of the middle ear ) . The bone is formed in the fetus from a fusion of the left and right mandibular prominences , and the point where these sides join , the mandibular symphysis , is still visible as a faint ridge in the midline . Like other symphyses in the body , this is a midline articulation where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage , but this articulation fuses together in early childhood . The word mandible derives from the Latin word mandibula , jawbone ( literally one used for chewing ) , from mandere to chew and -bula ( instrumental suffix ) .",
  "/wiki/Postcrania": "Postcrania ( postcranium , adjective : postcranial ) in zoology and vertebrate paleontology refers to all or part of the skeleton apart from the skull . Frequently , fossil remains , e.g . of dinosaurs or other extinct tetrapods , consist of partial or isolated skeletal elements ; these are referred to as postcrania . Sometimes , there is disagreement over whether the skull and skeleton belong to the same or different animals . One example is the case of a Cretaceous sauropod skull of Nemegtosaurus found in association with the postcranial skeleton Opisthocoelicaudia . In paleoanthropological studies , reconstruction of relationship between various species/remains is considered to be better supported by cranial characters rather than postcranial characters . However , this assumption is largely untested .",

  "/wiki/Reptiliomorph": "Reptiliomorpha is a clade containing the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians ( lissamphibians ) . It was defined by Michel Laurin ( 2001 ) and Vallin and Laurin ( 2004 ) as the largest clade that includes Homo sapiens , but not Ascaphus truei ( tailed frog ) . The informal variant of the name , reptiliomorphs , is also occasionally used to refer to stem-amniotes , i.e . a grade of reptile-like tetrapods that are more closely related to amniotes than they are to lissamphibians , but are not amniotes themselves ; the name is used in this meaning e.g . by Ruta , Coates and Quicke ( 2003 ) . An alternative name , Anthracosauria , is also commonly used for the group , but is confusingly also used for a more primitive grade of reptiliomorphs ( Embolomeri ) by Benton . As the exact phylogenetic position of Lissamphibia within Tetrapoda remains uncertain , it also remains controversial which fossil tetrapods are more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians , and thus , which ones of them were reptiliomorphs in any meaning of the word . The two major hypotheses for lissamphibian origins are that they are either descendants of dissorophoid temnospondyls or microsaurian lepospondyls . If the former ( the temnospondyl hypothesis ) is true , then Reptiliomorpha includes all tetrapod groups that are closer to amniotes than to temnospondyls . These include the diadectomorphs , seymouriamorphs , most or all lepospondyls , gephyrostegids , and possibly the embolomeres and chroniosuchians . In addition , several anthracosaur genera of uncertain taxonomic placement would also probably qualify as reptiliomorphs , including Solenodonsaurus , Eldeceeon , Silvanerpeton , and Casineria .
