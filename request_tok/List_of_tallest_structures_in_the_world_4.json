Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area .",

The tower was one of the projects of the Fortune Group , which has a number of other projects in Dubai such as the Fortune Bay and Fortune Tower . The proposed building plan contained 74 floors of office space , a retail area at the base , and a hotel and serviced apartments in the top 27 floors . A 5-star hotel section would contain the highest hotel rooms in the world . The building would also feature a 6-storey crown that contained a Turkish bath , sky garden , and other club facilities . Ground breaking occurred on 12 November 2006 with the tower slated for completion in 2009 , but the project was dogged by delays in payments from investors due to the global financial crisis . Construction of the tower was put on hold just after piling work on the foundations was completed in 2009 . The main contractor for construction had not yet been selected when a report stated the structure was expected to be completed in 2012 . There was little sign of activity at the site after 2009 , and no further statements regarding progress . The pit dug out for foundations was allowed to fill with water , and as of May 2013 [ update ] , satellite maps of the site revealed it had been filled in and levelled ."
