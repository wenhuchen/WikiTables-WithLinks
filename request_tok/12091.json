  "/wiki/John_Wayne_Pioneer_Trail": "The Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail , formerly known as the John Wayne Pioneer Trail , is a rail trail that spans most of the U.S. state of Washington . It follows the former railway roadbed of the Chicago , Milwaukee , St. Paul & Pacific Railroad ( Milwaukee Road ) for 300 miles ( 480 km ) across two-thirds of the state , from the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains to the Idaho border . The former Milwaukee Road roadbed was acquired by the state of Washington via a quitclaim deed , and is used as a non-motorized recreational trail managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission and by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources . State legislation railbanked the corridor with provisions that allow for the reversion to railroad usage in the future . The trail was originally named the John Wayne Pioneer Trail in honor of the John Wayne Pioneer Wagons and Riders Association for their assistance in creating the trail . The 100-mile ( 160 km ) portion from Cedar Falls ( near North Bend ) to the Columbia River south of Vantage has been developed and is managed as the Iron Horse State Park . In 2002 , it was designated a National Recreation Trail . In 2018 , the trail was renamed to the Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission .",

  "/wiki/Sideling_Hill_Tunnel": "Sideling Hill Tunnel is one of three original Pennsylvania Turnpike tunnels abandoned ( this one in 1968 ) after two massive realignment projects . The others are nearby Rays Hill Tunnel , and farther west , the Laurel Hill Tunnel . It was less expensive to realign the Turnpike than to bore a second tube for four lane traffic . Sideling Hill Tunnel is 6,782 feet ( 2,067 m ) long . It was the longest of the original tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike . The Ray 's Hill Tunnel and Sideling Hill Tunnel are now part of the Pike2Bike Trail . Together , the two tunnels as well as the roadway are commonly known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike . From the Turnpike 's opening in 1940 until the realignment projects , the tunnels were bottlenecks ; opposing traffic in the same tubes reduced speeds . Four other tunnels on the Turnpike - Allegheny Mountain , Tuscarora Mountain , Kittatinny Mountain , and Blue Mountain - each had a second tube bored , the least expensive option . All of the original tunnels except for the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel were part of Vanderbilt 's Folly , the never-completed South Pennsylvania Railroad .",

  "/wiki/Switzerland": "Switzerland , officially the Swiss Confederation , is a country situated in the confluence of western , central , and southern Europe . [ note 4 ] It is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons , with federal authorities seated in Bern . [ note 1 ] Switzerland is a landlocked country bordered by Italy to the south , France to the west , Germany to the north , and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east . It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau , the Alps , and the Jura , spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 ( 15,940 sq mi ) , and land area of 39,997 km2 ( 15,443 sq mi ) .

The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world . Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross , one of the world 's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations , and is home to numerous international organisations , including the second largest UN office .

  "/wiki/Great_Allegheny_Passage": "The Great Allegheny Passage ( GAP ) is a rail trail system in Maryland and Pennsylvania - the central trail of a network of long-distance hiker-biker trails throughout the Allegheny region of the Appalachian Mountains , connecting Washington , D.C. to Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . It consists of several smaller trails including the Allegheny Highlands Trail of Maryland , the Allegheny Highlands Trail of Pennsylvania and the Youghiogheny River Trail . The GAP 's first 9-mile ( 14 km ) section near Ohiopyle , Pennsylvania , opened in 1986 . The 9-mile ( 14 km ) section between Woodcock Hollow and Cumberland opened on December 13 , 2006 . In June 2013 , thirty-five years after construction first began , the final GAP section was completed ( from West Homestead to Pittsburgh ) at an overall cost of $ 80 million and gave Pennsylvania the most open trail miles in the nation ( 900 miles , with 1,110 miles under development ) . The completion project was titled The Point Made , because it was now possible to reach Point State Park in Pittsburgh from Washington , D.C. Celebrations took place on June 15 , 2013 . The multi-use trail , suitable for biking and walking , uses defunct corridors of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad , Union Railroad and the Western Maryland Railway - extending 150 miles ( 240 km ) from Cumberland , Maryland to Point State Park in downtown Pittsburgh , and includes the 52-mile ( 84 km ) branch ( Montour Trail ) to the Pittsburgh International Airport . Completing a continuous , non-motorized corridor from Point State Park 335 miles ( 539 km ) to Washington , D.C. , the GAP connects with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath trail , which runs 184.5 miles ( 296.9 km ) between Cumberland and Washington , D.C . The Allegheny Trail Alliance ( ATA ) - a coalition of seven trail organizations related to the GAP ( Friends of the Riverfront , Steel Valley Trail , Regional Trail Corporation , Ohiopyle State Park , and Mountains Maryland ) maintains the 150-mile GAP , which is also a segment of the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail , one of eight nationally designated scenic trails . The trail 's formal name , the Great Allegheny Passage , was selected in 2001 by the ATA after six years and more than 100 proposals as a name evocative of the geography and historical heritage of the trail , having been suggested by Bill Metzger , editor of the ATA newsletter . The trail used a temporary name , the Cumberland and Pittsburgh Trail , before its official name was adopted . The second runner-up title for the trail was the Allegheny Frontier Trail ."
