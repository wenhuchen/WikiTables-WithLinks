His role in the show is that of consultant cardiothoracic surgeon and head of the cardiothoracic surgery department at Holby General . Irving had considerable input in creating the character , who was initially envisioned by the series producers as an Iranian surgeon named Hussein . At Irving 's suggestion , Meyer became Hungarian , an emigrant to Britain following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution . Little of the backstory created for Meyer was ever revealed on-screen , as part of a deliberate bid to present the character as enigmatic , allowing viewers to project their own imagination onto him . Meyer is a driven , arrogant surgeon , with high expectations of his colleagues . His major storylines see him operate on his own sister , fear that he may have motor neuron disease , lose his spleen after being shot in a road rage incident , and ultimately depart from Holby for Michigan when the hospital Board make impositions on his autonomy . Irving made the decision to leave the series as he struggled to set the character aside outside of work , which had a negative impact on his personal life . He ruled out the possibility of returning to Holby City in future , preferring his memory of Meyer to remain untarnished . Meyer proved popular with viewers and critics .

  "/wiki/Midwife": "A midwife is a health professional who cares for mothers and newborns around childbirth , a specialization known as midwifery . The education and training for a midwife is similar to that of a nurse , in contrast to obstetricians and perinatologists who are physicians ( doctors ) . In many countries , midwifery is either a branch of nursing or has some links to nursing such as a shared regulatory body , though others regard them as entirely separate professions . Midwives are trained to recognize variations from the normal progress of labor and understand how to deal with deviations from normal . They may intervene in high risk situations such as breech births , twin births , and births where the baby is in a posterior position , using non-invasive techniques . For complications related to pregnancy and birth that are beyond the midwife 's scope of practice , including surgical and instrumental deliveries , they refer their patients to physicians or surgeons . In many parts of the world , these professions work in tandem to provide care to childbearing women . In others , only the midwife is available to provide care , and in yet other countries , many women elect to utilize obstetricians primarily over midwives . Many developing countries are investing money and training for midwives , sometimes by upskilling those people already practicing as traditional birth attendants . Some primary care services are currently lacking , due to a shortage of funding for these resources .",
