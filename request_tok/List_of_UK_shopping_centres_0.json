The centre was developed by the Westfield Group at a cost of \u00a31.6bn , on a site bounded by the West Cross Route ( A3220 ) , the Westway ( A40 ) and Wood Lane ( A219 ) . It opened on 30 October 2008 and became the largest covered shopping development in the capital , dethroning the Whitgift Centre in Croydon . After further investment and expansion , it became the largest shopping centre in Europe in March 2018 . The centre is in the White City district , where several other large-scale development projects are under way or in the planning stages . The development is on a large brownfield site , part of which was once the location of the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition ; the initial site clearance demolished the set of halls still remaining from the exhibition ( their cheap-to-build , white-painted blank facades are said to be the origin of the name White City ) . Much of the site was in use as a railway depot excavated to a lower level and built over . The centre is noted for its size : it has a retail floor area of 150,000 m\u00b2 ( 1.62 million ft\u00b2 ) , the equivalent of about 30 football pitches . At the time of its opening it was reported to be the second largest commercial centre in the UK ( after MetroCentre near Newcastle ) . After an extension opened in March 2018 , the centre became the largest in the UK and Europe .

At the 2011 Census , its population was almost 230,000 ; the Office for National Statistics estimates that it will reach 300,000 by 2025 . The River Great Ouse forms its northern boundary ; a tributary , the River Ouzel , meanders through its linear parks and balancing lakes . Approximately 25% of the urban area is parkland or woodland and includes two SSIs . In the 1960s , the UK Government decided that a further generation of new towns in the South East of England was needed to relieve housing congestion in London . The New Town ( in planning documents , New City ) of Milton Keynes was to be the biggest yet , with a target population of 250,000 , in a designated area of about 22,000 acres ( 9,000 ha ) . At designation , its area incorporated the existing towns of Bletchley , Wolverton , and Stony Stratford , along with another fifteen villages and farmland in between . These settlements had an extensive historical record since the Norman conquest ; detailed archaeological investigations prior to development revealed evidence of human occupation from the Neolithic age to modern times , including in particular the Milton Keynes Hoard of Bronze Age gold jewellery . The government established a Development Corporation ( MKDC ) to design and deliver this New City . The Corporation decided on a softer , more human-scaled landscape than in the earlier new towns but with an emphatically modernist architecture . Recognising how traditional towns and cities had become choked in traffic , they established a 'relaxed ' grid of distributor roads about 1 kilometre ( 0.62 mi ) between edges , leaving the spaces between to develop more organically .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .

During the 12th century a charter was granted allowing a market , and the building of St Mary 's Church began .

The Grand Junction Canal in 1798 and the London and Birmingham Railway in 1837 resulted in Watford 's rapid growth , with paper-making mills such as John Dickinson at Croxley , influencing the development of printing in the town .

As the county town , Renfrew once was a centre of local government for the surrounding area . Whilst the county remained known as Renfrewshire , the focus of local government gradually shifted from Renfrew to its larger neighbour Paisley . Following the reorganisation of 1996 , Renfrewshire was divided for local government purposes into three modern council areas : Renfrewshire , with considerably smaller boundaries than the old county , including Renfrew and with its administrative centre at Paisley ; Inverclyde with its centre at Greenock , covering the western part of the county ; and East Renfrewshire , with its centre at Giffnock . The boundaries of the historic County of Renfrew remain for a number of ceremonial and administrative purposes . The House of Stewart was previously based out of the former Renfrew Castle . In 1164 , it was the site of the Battle of Renfrew , a decisive victory for the Scottish crown over Somerled , Lord of the Isles .
