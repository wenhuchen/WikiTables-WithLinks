  "/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance": "The Harlem Renaissance was an intellectual , social , and artistic explosion centered in Harlem , Manhattan , New York City , spanning the 1920s . At the time , it was known as the New Negro Movement , named after The New Negro , a 1925 anthology edited by Alain Locke . The movement also included the new African-American cultural expressions across the urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest United States affected by the Great Migration , of which Harlem was the largest . Though it was centered in the Harlem neighborhood , many francophone black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the movement , which spanned from about 1918 until the mid-1930s . Many of its ideas lived on much longer . The zenith of this flowering of Negro literature , as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance , took place between 1924 - when Opportunity : A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance - and 1929 , the year of the stock-market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression . The Harlem Renaissance is considered to have been a rebirth of the African-American arts .",
