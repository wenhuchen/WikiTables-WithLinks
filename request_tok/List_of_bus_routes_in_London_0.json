Marylebone was the last of London 's main line termini to be built and is one of the smallest , opening with half of the platforms originally planned . There has been an interchange with the Bakerloo line since 1907 , but not with any other lines . Traffic declined at Marylebone station from the mid-20th century , particularly after the GCML closed . By the 1980s , it was threatened with closure , but was reprieved because of commuter traffic on the London to Aylesbury Line ( a remaining part of the GCML ) and from High Wycombe . In 1993 the station found a new role as the terminus of the Chiltern Main Line . Following the privatisation of British Rail , the station was expanded with two additional platforms in 2006 and improved services to Birmingham Snow Hill .

  "/wiki/Blackfriars,_London": "Blackfriars is an area of central London , which lies in the south-west corner of the City of London . The name Blackfriars was first used in 1317 ( as Black Freres from the French 'fr\u00e8re ' meaning 'brother ' ) and derives from the black cappa worn by the Dominican Friars who moved their priory from Holborn to the area between the River Thames and Ludgate Hill in about 1276 . Edward I gave permission to rebuild London 's city wall , which lay between the river and Ludgate Hill , around their area . The site was used for great occasions of state , including meetings of Parliament and the Privy Council , state visits , such as of Emperor Charles V in 1522 , as well as the location for a divorce hearing in 1529 of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII . The priory was eventually closed in 1538 during Henry 's dissolution of the monasteries . Katherine Parr , Henry VIII 's sixth and final wife , was born in the area . Some of the buildings were subsequently leased to a group of entrepreneurs who created the Blackfriars Theatre on the site , not far from Shakespeare 's Globe Theatre which stood almost directly across on the other side of the river . In 1632 , the Society of Apothecaries ( a livery company ) , acquired the monastery 's guesthouse and established their base there . The building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London but the Society rebuilt and Apothecaries Hall is still to be found in Blackfriars today . The area is now the location of Blackfriars station and forms the northern bridge-head for both Blackfriars Bridge and Blackfriars Railway Bridge .

  "/wiki/Sudbury,_London": "Sudbury ( /\u02c8s\u028cdb\u0259ri/ ) is a suburb in the London Boroughs of Brent and Harrow , located in northwest London , United Kingdom . The suburb forms the western part of Wembley and is centred around 0.6 miles ( 1 km ) west of Wembley Central railway station . Sudbury is an historical area having once extended from the 'South Manor- Sudbury ' ( thought to have been on Harrow Hill ) to the area that is now known as Wembley Central . Much of the land that once formed Sudbury Common until the 1930s has now been developed as a relatively green residential suburb of London . Much of Sudbury was once in the ownership of the Barham family who give their name to a number of local landmarks including Barham School and Barham Park . Today , Sudbury covers a narrow area with Wembley to its east , North Wembley to its north , Sudbury Hill to the west , and North Greenford , in the London Borough of Ealing , directly south . Its section in the borough of Harrow is around Sudbury Court Drive , which is technically located within North Wembley .",

  "/wiki/Battersea_Bridge": "Battersea Bridge is a five-span arch bridge with cast-iron girders and granite piers crossing the River Thames in London , England . It is situated on a sharp bend in the river , and links Battersea south of the river with Chelsea to the north . The bridge replaced a ferry service that had operated near the site since at least the middle of the 16th century . The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge commissioned by John , Earl Spencer , who had recently acquired the rights to operate the ferry . Although a stone bridge was planned , difficulties in raising investment meant that a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead . Designed by Henry Holland , it was initially opened to pedestrians in November 1771 , and to vehicle traffic in 1772 . The bridge was inadequately designed and dangerous both to its users and to passing shipping , and boats often collided with it . To reduce the dangers to shipping , two piers were removed and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders . Although dangerous and unpopular , the bridge was the last surviving wooden bridge on the Thames in London , and was the subject of paintings by many significant artists such as J. M. W. Turner , John Sell Cotman and James McNeill Whistler , including Whistler 's Nocturne : Blue and Gold - Old Battersea Bridge , and his controversial Nocturne in Black and Gold - The Falling Rocket . In 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership , and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge , designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem & Co . The narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London , it is one of London 's least busy Thames bridges . The location on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping , and it has been closed many times due to collisions .",
