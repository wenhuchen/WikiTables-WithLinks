  "/wiki/Crow_Creek_Water_Ditch": "The Crow Creek Water Ditch is a historic water transportation system which brought water from Eureka Creek to where it was needed in gold placer mining in the Indian Creek drainage area where gold was discovered in 1866 . It is located near Townsend , Montana . It was built between 1866 and c.1875 originally to support gold mining , which required water , then later was used for farm and ranch irrigation . Over its 11 miles ( 18 km ) length it dropped from 6,300 feet ( 1,900 m ) to 4,000 feet ( 1,200 m ) elevation . Along most of its length , in two sections , it was a hand-dug ditch about 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) wide and 1 foot ( 0.30 m ) deep that was dug using shovels , picks and axes . One section was a spectacular 1,578 feet ( 481 m ) wooden flume which brought it along walls of Hassel Canyon . It also included a 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) section where it ran down natural gullies where no digging was needed . An approximately 8 miles ( 13 km ) portion of it -- the two hand-dug sections -- was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 . The listed area also includes remnants of a wooden flume , and a rubble stone dam . In 1918 the Crow Creek Irrigation District was formed by farmers and ranchers for irrigation . With the creation of Canyon Ferry Lake the need for the canals decreased .",

  "/wiki/Missouri_River": "The Missouri River is the longest river in North America . Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana , the Missouri flows east and south for 2,341 miles ( 3,767 km ) before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis , Missouri . The river drains a sparsely populated , semi-arid watershed of more than 500,000 square miles ( 1,300,000 km2 ) , which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces . Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi , the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer and carries a comparable volume of water . When combined with the lower Mississippi River , it forms the world 's fourth longest river system . For over 12,000 years , people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation . More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed , most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous bison herds that roamed through the Great Plains . The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century , and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase . The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century . The growth of the fur trade in the early 19th century laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails . Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s , first by covered wagon , then by the growing numbers of steamboats that entered service on the river . Settlers took over former Native American lands in the watershed , leading to some of the most longstanding and violent wars against indigenous peoples in American history .",
