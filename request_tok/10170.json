  "/wiki/The_King_and_I": "The King and I is the fifth musical by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II . It is based on Margaret Landon 's novel , Anna and the King of Siam ( 1944 ) , which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens , governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s . The musical 's plot relates the experiences of Anna , a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King 's drive to modernize his country . The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece , as well as by a love to which neither can admit . The musical premiered on March 29 , 1951 , at Broadway 's St. James Theatre . It ran for nearly three years , making it the fourth longest-running Broadway musical in history at the time , and has had many tours and revivals . In 1950 , theatrical attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a part for her client , veteran leading lady Gertrude Lawrence . Holtzmann realized that Landon 's book would provide an ideal vehicle and contacted Rodgers and Hammerstein , who were initially reluctant but agreed to write the musical . The pair initially sought Rex Harrison to play the supporting part of the King , a role he had played in the 1946 film made from Landon 's book , but he was unavailable . They settled on the young actor and television director Yul Brynner . The musical was an immediate hit , winning Tony Awards for Best Musical , Best Actress ( for Lawrence ) and Best Featured Actor ( for Brynner ) . Lawrence died unexpectedly of cancer a year and a half after the opening , and the role of Anna was played by several actresses during the remainder of the Broadway run of 1,246 performances .",
