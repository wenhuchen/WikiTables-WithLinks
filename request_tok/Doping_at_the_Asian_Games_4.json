Nandrolone esters are used in the treatment of anemias , cachexia ( wasting syndrome ) , osteoporosis , breast cancer , and for other indications . They are not used by mouth and instead are given by injection into muscle or fat . Side effects of nandrolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire . They are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . Nandrolone esters have strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects , which give them a mild side effect profile and make them especially suitable for use in women and children . They are long-lasting prodrugs of nandrolone in the body . Nandrolone esters were first described and introduced for medical use in the late 1950s . They are among the most widely used AAS worldwide . In addition to their medical use , nandrolone esters are used to improve physique and performance , and are said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes .

  "/wiki/Metabolite": "A metabolite is the intermediate end product of metabolism . The term metabolite is usually restricted to small molecules . Metabolites have various functions , including fuel , structure , signaling , stimulatory and inhibitory effects on enzymes , catalytic activity of their own ( usually as a cofactor to an enzyme ) , defense , and interactions with other organisms ( e.g . pigments , odorants , and pheromones ) . A primary metabolite is directly involved in normal growth , development , and reproduction . Ethylene is an example of a primary metabolite produced in large-scale by industrial microbiology . A secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes , but usually has an important ecological function . Examples include antibiotics and pigments such as resins and terpenes etc . Some antibiotics use primary metabolites as precursors , such as actinomycin which is created from the primary metabolite , tryptophan . Some sugars are metabolites , such as fructose or glucose , which are both present in the metabolic pathways . Examples of primary metabolites produced by industrial microbiology :",

It is also used in veterinary medicine . Stanozolol has mostly been discontinued , and remains available in only a few countries . It is given by mouth in humans or by injection into muscle in animals . Unlike most injectable AAS , stanozolol is not esterified and is sold as an aqueous suspension , or in oral tablet form . The drug has a high oral bioavailability , due to a C17\u03b1 alkylation which allows the hormone to survive first-pass liver metabolism when ingested . It is because of this that stanozolol is also sold in tablet form . Stanozolol is one of the AAS commonly used as performance-enhancing drugs and is banned from use in sports competition under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) and many other sporting bodies . Additionally , stanozolol has been used in US horse racing .",
