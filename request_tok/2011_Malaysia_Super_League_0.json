They competed in 2008 Malaysia FAM League and achieved promotion to Malaysia Premier League for 2009 season . The club was then also promoted to Malaysia Super League after just one season in second division and then competed in 2010 Malaysia Super League . The club was further rebranded as T-Team Titans to gather local support . The team quickly gained popularity among the local football fans as everyone 's favourite underdog . As the team kept surpassing the pundits ' and supporters ' expectations season after season they also showed that they were more than capable of competing and beating Malaysia 's heavyweights ( JDT , Pahang and Kedah ) even with their tight budget and often young squad ."
