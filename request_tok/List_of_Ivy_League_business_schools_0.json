  "/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science": "A Bachelor of Science ( Latin Baccalaureus Scientiae , B.S. , BS , B.Sc . or BSc ; or , less commonly , S.B. , SB , or Sc.B. , from the equivalent Latin Scientiae Baccalaureus ) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for programs that generally last three to five years . The first university to admit a student to the degree of Bachelor of Science was the University of London in 1860 . Whether a student of a particular subject is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree or a Bachelor of Arts degree can vary between universities . For example , an economics degree may be given as a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) by one university but as a BS by another , and some universities offer the choice of either . Some liberal arts colleges in the United States offer only the BA , even in the natural sciences , while some universities offer only the BS , even in non-science fields . At universities that offer both BA and BS degrees in the same discipline , the BS degree is usually more extensive in that particular discipline and is targeted toward students who are pursuing graduate school or a profession in that field .",
  "/wiki/Master_of_Business_Administration": "The Master of Business Administration ( MBA or M.B.A. ) degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought scientific management . The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business administration such as accounting , applied statistics , business communication , business ethics , business law , business strategy , finance , managerial economics , management , entrepreneurship , marketing , supply-chain management , and operations management in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy . Most programs also include elective courses and concentrations for further study in a particular area , for example accounting , finance , and marketing . MBA programs in the United States typically require completing about forty to sixty credits ( sixty to ninety in a quarter system ) , much higher than the thirty credits ( thirty-six to forty-five in a quarter system ) typically required for degrees that cover some of the same material such as the Master of Economics , Master of Finance , Master of Accountancy , Master of Science in Marketing and Master of Science in Management . The MBA is a terminal degree and a professional degree . Accreditation bodies specifically for MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education . Business schools in many countries offer programs tailored to full-time , part-time , executive ( abridged coursework typically occurring on nights or weekends ) and distance learning students , many with specialized concentrations .",
  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries . PhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields . As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree . Sometimes this status is also colloquially known as PhD ABD , meaning All But Dissertation .",

The Tuck School awards only one degree , the Master of Business Administration degree , through a full-time , residential program . The school does not offer an Executive MBA or a part-time program , believing that such programs , while lucrative , would dilute the focus of its full-time MBA program . Tuck does , however , offer an Advanced Management Program for executives , which spans either one or two weeks depending on the course . In addition , Tuck offers a 4-week , intensive summer program to liberal arts students seeking to build a foundation in core business concepts . Within Dartmouth , faculty from Tuck and The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice are partnering to offer a Master of Health Care Delivery Science degree from Dartmouth College . Moreover , Tuck partners with the Thayer School of Engineering to teach management courses through a Master of Engineering Management program offered by Thayer School of Engineering . Compared to other elite business schools , Tuck is known for its rural setting and small class size - each MBA class consists of about 280 students . As such , both factors , combined with Tuck 's commitment to the full-time MBA program attribute to its high giving rate among the 10,300 Tuck alumni across 73 countries . Almost 70% of all Tuck alumni regularly give to the school , the highest rate among business schools worldwide .

  "/wiki/Samuel_Curtis_Johnson_Graduate_School_of_Management": "The Johnson School traces its beginnings to the university 's founding in 1865 . University co-founder Ezra Cornell proposed a Department of Trade and Commerce for the new university , which was a radical departure from the day 's conventional notions about higher education , as this proposal was made sixteen years before Joseph Wharton endowed the nation 's first collegiate business school at the University of Pennsylvania . At a university faculty meeting on October 2 , 1868 , Cornell co-founder and first president Andrew Dickson White , suggested the creation of a professorship in bookkeeping in the context of a larger proposal : the creation of a commercial college . In the meantime , the Agriculture College continued to have a Department of Agricultural Economics and the Arts College continued to have a Department of Economics . Formal movements towards a business school began in 1914 , when faculty in the NYS College of Agriculture ( which today offers an undergraduate business major ) convened the first meeting of the Committee on a Commercial College . Led by economics professor Allyn Young , the committee recommended the creation of a two-year graduate course leading to the Master 's degree in both business and public administration . Young had been trained at Harvard University , and the influence on the committee 's discussion of its business school 's creation only six years prior was apparent , as the committee 's recommendations included instruction for graduate students only , selectivity in admissions , and integration into the larger university community . The idea of a business school took a backseat to World War I and its effects on the Cornell population . Following the Armistice of 1918 , third university president Jacob Gould Schurman called for the establishment of such a school , which he estimated would require $ 1 million of initial funding . However , financial difficulties surrounding the Great Depression would further delay its creation .",
