  "/wiki/Shinzo_Abe": "Shinzo Abe ( \u5b89\u500d \u664b\u4e09 , Abe Shinz\u014d , IPA : [ abe \u0255in ( d ) zo\u02d0 ] ; born 21 September 1954 ) is a Japanese politician who has been the Prime Minister of Japan since 2012 . Abe is also currently the president of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . He previously served as Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2006 , and as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007 , making him the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history . First elected to the House of Representatives election in the 1993 election , he rose to be appointed chief cabinet secretary by Junichiro Koizumi , before replacing Koizumi as LDP president in September 2006 . He was subsequently confirmed as prime minister by a special session of the National Diet , becoming , aged 52 , Japan 's youngest post-war prime minister , and the first to have been born after World War II . Abe resigned in September 2007 , citing health reasons , shortly after his party lost the House of Councillors election that year . He was replaced by Yasuo Fukuda , the first in a series of five prime ministers who each failed to retain office for more than sixteen months . After recovering from illness , Abe staged an unexpected political comeback , defeating former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba in a vote to become LDP president for a second time in September 2012 . Following the LDP 's landslide victory in the general election that December , he became the first former prime minister to return to the office since Shigeru Yoshida in 1948 . He was later re-elected in similar landslides in the 2014 and 2017 elections . Abe is a conservative whom political commentators have widely described as a right-wing nationalist . He is a member of Nippon Kaigi and holds revisionist views on Japanese history , including denying the role of government coercion in the recruitment of comfort women during World War II , a position which has created tension with neighboring South Korea .",
  "/wiki/House_of_Councillors": "The House of Councillors ( \u53c2\u8b70\u9662 , Sangiin ) is the upper house of the National Diet of Japan . The House of Representatives is the lower house . The House of Councillors is the successor to the pre-war House of Peers . If the two houses disagree on matters of the budget , treaties , or designation of the prime minister , the House of Representatives can insist on its decision . In other decisions , the House of Representatives can override a vote of the House of Councillors only by a two-thirds majority of members present . The House of Councillors has 242 members who each serve six-year terms , two years longer than those of the House of Representatives . Councillors must be at least 30 years old , compared with 25 years old in the House of Representatives . The House can not be dissolved , as only half of its membership is elected at each election . Of the 121 members subject to election each time , 73 are elected from the 47 prefectural districts by single non-transferable vote ( SNTV ) and 48 are elected from a nationwide list by proportional representation ( PR ) with open lists .",

They are located east of Mainland China , northeast of Taiwan , west of Okinawa Island , and north of the southwestern end of the Ryukyu Islands . They are also known as the Diaoyu Islands or Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands ( Chinese : \u9493\u9c7c\u5c9b\u53ca\u5176\u9644\u5c5e\u5c9b\u5c7f ; pinyin : Di\u00e0oy\u00fad\u01ceo j\u00ed q\u00ed f\u00f9sh\u01d4 d\u01ceoy\u01d4 ; also simply \u9493\u9c7c\u5c9b ) in Mainland China , the Diaoyutai Islands ( Chinese : \u91e3\u9b5a\u53f0\u5217\u5dbc ; pinyin : Di\u00e0oy\u00fat\u00e1i li\u00e8 y\u01d4 ) in Taiwan , and the Pinnacle Islands . As a result of the discovery of potential undersea oil reserves in 1968 in the area and the 1971 transfer of administrative control of the islands from the United States to Japan , the latter 's sovereignty over the territory is disputed by both the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) and the Republic of China ( also known as Taiwan ) . China claims the discovery and ownership of the islands from the 14th century , while Japan maintained ownership of the islands from 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II . The United States administered the islands as part of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands from 1945 until 1972 , when the islands returned to Japanese control under the Okinawa Reversion Agreement between the United States and Japan . The islands are disputed between Japan and China and between Japan and Taiwan . Despite the diplomatic stalemate between mainland China and Taiwan , both governments agree that the islands are part of Taiwan as part of Toucheng Township in Yilan County . Japan administers and controls the Senkaku islands as part of the city of Ishigaki in Okinawa Prefecture . It does not acknowledge the claims of China nor Taiwan and has not allowed the Ishigaki administration to develop the islands . As a result of the dispute , the public is largely barred from approaching the uninhabited islands , which are about a seven-hour boat ride from Ishigaki . Vessels from the Japan Coast Guard pursue Chinese ships crossing the maritime boundary in what one visiting journalist described in 2012 as an almost cold war-style game of cat-and-mouse , and fishing and other civilian boats are prevented from getting too close to avoid a provocative incident .",

  "/wiki/Envoy_(title)": "An envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary , usually known as a minister , was a diplomatic head of mission who was ranked below ambassador . A diplomatic mission headed by an envoy was known as a legation rather than an embassy . Under the system of diplomatic ranks established by the Congress of Vienna ( 1815 ) , an envoy was a diplomat of the second class who had plenipotentiary powers , i.e. , full authority to represent the government . However , envoys did not serve as the personal representative of their country 's head of state . Until the 20th century , most diplomatic missions were legations headed by diplomats of the envoy rank . Ambassadors were only exchanged between great powers , close allies , and related monarchies . After World War II it was no longer considered acceptable to treat some nations as inferior to others , given the United Nations doctrine of equality of sovereign states . The rank of envoy gradually became obsolete as countries upgraded their relations to the ambassadorial rank . The envoy rank still existed in 1961 , when the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations was signed , but it did not outlive the decade . The last remaining American legations , in the Warsaw Pact countries of Bulgaria and Hungary , were upgraded to embassies in 1966 ."
