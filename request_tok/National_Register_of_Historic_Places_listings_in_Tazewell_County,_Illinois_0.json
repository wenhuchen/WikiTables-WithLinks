  "/wiki/Allentown_Union_Hall": "The Allentown Union Hall is a historic meeting hall located 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) east of Illinois Route 121 in Allentown , Illinois . The building was built in 1892 to host community events in Allentown , a small rural settlement . Like many small communities nationwide at the turn of the century , the citizens of Allentown wished to expand their educational and cultural horizons ; since rough dirt roads made travel outside the community difficult , the community used the hall to host its own cultural events . The Allentown Helping Hand Circle , the community organization that raised the money for the building , hosted many of the hall 's early events , which included community dinners and talent shows . The hall also hosted shows put on both by actors and musicians from Allentown and the surrounding area and by traveling acts who stopped in the community . As the only large public building in the area , the town hall also served as a polling place , a clubhouse for women 's clubs and fraternal organizations , a church for the community 's religious groups , and an auditorium for the local school . The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 12 , 1988 .",

  "/wiki/Ayer_Public_Library_(Delavan,_Illinois)": "The Ayer Public Library is a Carnegie library located at 200 Locust Street in Delavan , Illinois . The library was the city 's fifth attempt at forming a library ; it succeeded and assumed the collection of a library founded in 1902 by the Blue Button Army temperance organization . When the Blue Button library closed in 1907 , supporter Amos K. Ayer called for the city to establish a permanent public library . With Ayer 's financial backing , a library for all citizens of Delavan Township was approved the same year ; however , it used a temporary space and lacked a permanent home until the city applied to the Carnegie Foundation for assistance in 1912 . After a protracted misunderstanding with James Bertram , who expected a city library tax and did not understand that the township provided tax support , the Foundation provided a $ 10,000 grant for the library and construction began in 1914 . The Classical Revival library opened later in the year ; it remains open to this day . The library was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 12 , 1998 .",

  "/wiki/Farm_Creek_Section": "The Farm Creek Section , also known as the Farmdale Geologic Exposure , is a hillside near East Peoria , Illinois that clearly showed geological strata . It is nationally significant as one of the first exposed glacial stratifications in the United States to be scientifically documented . These Ice Age geological formations , with rock layers representing different periods of glaciation , had long been known and published in England , France , and Germany , but were not yet well known in North America . Geologist Frank Leverett discovered this exposed face of a hill with its clearly defined stratifications in 1879 and described and pictured it in his monograph , The Illinois Glacial Lobe , in 1899 . The Farm Creek publication gave a name to the Illinoian glaciation , the southernmost penetration of glacial ice into what was to become the Midwestern United States . It also helped formulate regional and national stratigraphic classifications and has figured prominently in the study and development of glacial geology . A 15-acre ( 6.1 ha ) area of the Farm Creek Section was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997 . The site is on the south side of Farm Creek ( a tributary of the Illinois River ) in the Farm Creek Recreation Area , south of Illinois Route 8 ( Washington St. ) and between School Street and Bittersweet Road , and is accessible by following an unpaved road , part of which is an abandoned right of way formerly in use by the Toledo , Peoria and Western Railroad .
