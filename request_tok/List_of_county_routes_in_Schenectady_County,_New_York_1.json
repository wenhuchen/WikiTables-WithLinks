  "/wiki/US_20_(NY)": "U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from Newport , Oregon , to Boston , Massachusetts . In the U.S. state of New York , US 20 extends 372.32 miles ( 599.19 km ) from the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley to the Massachusetts state line in the Berkshire Mountains . US 20 is the longest surface road in New York . It runs near the Lake Erie shore from Ripley to Buffalo and passes through the southern suburbs of Buffalo , the Finger Lakes , the glacial moraines of Central New York , and the city of Albany before crossing into Massachusetts . US 20 connects to all three major north-south Interstate Highways in Upstate New York : Interstate 390 ( I-390 ) near Avon , I-81 south of Syracuse , and I-87 in Albany by way of Fuller Road Alternate . With the exception of Albany , it passes directly through no major cities of the state , bypassing Syracuse and Utica by great distances to the south while the New York State Thruway and New York State Route 5 ( NY 5 ) , which share its corridor , pass right through or close to them . It is , however , a major artery in many of the outlying areas it passes through in the hilly fringes of the Allegheny Plateau , often expanding to four lanes ( it has no limited-access sections , although many intersecting roads are grade-separated ) with extensive commercial strip development . One of these sections , the easterly of two concurrencies with NY 5 across the northern Finger Lakes , is the longest concurrency in the state , extending 67 miles ( 108 km ) from Avon to Auburn . From Oneida County to Albany , the road follows the historic Cherry Valley Turnpike , built at the beginning of the 19th century to connect Albany and , at the time , the important villages of Duanesburg , Cherry Valley , Cazenovia , and Skaneateles . US 20 itself was assigned in 1926 and was the state 's main east-west route from that time until the Thruway was completed in the 1950s .",
