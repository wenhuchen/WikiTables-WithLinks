Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona , Spain , on 26 April 1931 , at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona . It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games . To outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932 , Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler had a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium built , as well as six gymnasiums and many other smaller arenas . The games were the first to be televised , and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries . Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $ 7 million . Her film , titled Olympia , pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports . Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism , and the official Nazi party paper , the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games . German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods , although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club , Hakoah Vienna , did take part . Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime . Total ticket revenues were 7.5 million Reichsmark , generating a profit of over one million \u211b\u2133 . The official budget did not include outlays by the city of Berlin ( which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 16.5 million \u211b\u2133 ) or outlays of the German national government ( which did not make its costs public , but is estimated to have spent US $ 30 million ) .",

Owens specialized in the sprints and the long jump , and was recognized in his lifetime as perhaps the greatest and most famous athlete in track and field history . He set three world records and tied another , all in less than an hour at the 1935 Big Ten track meet in Ann Arbor , Michigan - a feat that has never been equaled and has been called the greatest 45 minutes ever in sport . He achieved international fame at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin , Germany , by winning four gold medals : 100 meters , 200 meters , long jump , and 4 \u00d7 100-meter relay . He was the most successful athlete at the Games and , as a black man , was credited with single-handedly crushing Hitler 's myth of Aryan supremacy , although he was n't invited to the White House to shake hands with the President , either . The Jesse Owens Award is USA Track and Field 's highest accolade for the year 's best track and field athlete .

  "/wiki/Congressional_Gold_Medal": "A Congressional Gold Medal is an award bestowed by the United States Congress . The congressional practice of issuing gold medals to occasionally honor recipients from the military began during the American Revolution . Later the practice extended to individuals in all walks of life and in the late 20th century also to groups . The Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the highest civilian awards in the United States . The congressional medal seeks to honor those , individually or as a group , who have performed an achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient 's field long after the achievement . However , There are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals . When a Congressional Gold Medal has been deemed appropriate , Congress has , by legislative action , provided for the creation of a medal on an ad hoc basis . Thus , there are generally fewer gold medals than presidential medals . U.S. citizenship is not a requirement . As of April 4 , 2019 , 163 institutions , people , or events have been awarded a Congressional Gold Medal .",

These Games were the first to be staged in the Southern Hemisphere and Oceania , as well as the first to be held outside Europe and North America . Melbourne is the most southerly city ever to host the Olympics . Due to the Southern Hemisphere 's seasons being different from those in the Northern Hemisphere , the 1956 Games did not take place at the usual time of year , because of the need to hold the events during the warmer weather of the host 's spring/summer ( which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere 's autumn/winter ) . The Olympic equestrian events could not be held in Melbourne due to Australia 's strict quarantine regulations , so they were held in Stockholm five months earlier . This was the second time that the Olympics were not held entirely in one country , the first being the 1920 Summer Olympics , which were held in Antwerp , Belgium , with some events taking place in Ostend , Belgium and Amsterdam , Netherlands . Despite uncertainties and various complications encountered during the preparations , the 1956 Games went ahead in Melbourne as planned and turned out to be a success .
