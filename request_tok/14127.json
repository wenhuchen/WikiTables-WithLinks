Having been founded according to legend by an unknown priest in 1104 , it is one of the few extant religious institutions in the area to predate the advent of Minamoto no Yoritomo , who arrived here in 1181 . Like all other Tenjin shrines in Japan , it enshrines the spirit of famous scholar and politician Sugawara no Michizane under the name Tenjin . For this reason , the kami is believed to be a protector of intellectual pursuits . Having been unjustly sent into exile , where he died , Michizane was deified and enshrined to pacify his soul , which was believed to be angry as a consequence . Numerous calamities that followed his death validated this belief .

In January 2012 it was announced that the Japanese government would formally submit the Kamakura site , along with Mount Fuji , for consideration by the World Heritage Committee in 2013 . ICOMOS , the advisory body for cultural World Heritage sites , inspected the site in late 2012 . The request was considered by the World Heritage Committee at its 37th session in Phnom Penh , Cambodia in September , 2013 . ICOMOS recommended not inscribing the site on the List , stating that the historical aspects of the site had largely been supplanted by the modern city that grew up around it and thus the site lacked the integrity necessary to be considered . The request for World Heritage status was duly withdrawn by Japan . Ten candidate areas were proposed with twenty-two component sites , spanning the cities of Kamakura , Yokohama , and Zushi :",

  "/wiki/Honden": "In Shinto shrine architecture , the honden ( \u672c\u6bbf , main hall ) , also called shinden ( \u795e\u6bbf ) , or sometimes sh\u014dden ( \u6607\u6bbf ) as in Ise Shrine 's case , is the most sacred building at a Shinto shrine , intended purely for the use of the enshrined kami , usually symbolized by a mirror or sometimes by a statue . The building is normally in the rear of the shrine and closed to the general public . In front of it usually stands the haiden , or oratory . The haiden is often connected to the honden by a heiden , or hall of offerings . Physically , the honden is the heart of the shrine complex , connected to the rest of the shrine but usually raised above it , and protected from public access by a fence called tamagaki . It usually is relatively small and with a gabled roof . Its doors are usually kept closed , except at religious festivals . Shinto priests themselves enter only to perform rituals . The rite of opening those doors is itself an important part of the shrine 's life . Inside the honden is kept the go-shintai ( \u5fa1\u795e\u4f53 ) , literally , the sacred body of the kami . The go-shintai is actually not divine , but just a temporary repository of the enshrined kami . Important as it is , the honden may sometimes be completely absent , as for example when the shrine stands on a sacred mountain to which it is dedicated , or when there are nearby himorogi ( enclosure ) or other yorishiro ( substitute object ) that serve as a more direct bond to a kami .",

The city was therefore a natural fortress and , according to the Azuma Kagami , it was chosen by Minamoto no Yoritomo as his base specifically for this reason . The name itself seems to have been modeled on that of Kyoto 's Seven Entrances ( \u4eac\u90fd\u4e03\u53e3 ) - sometimes translated as the seven mouths - which first appears in the literature of the intermediate Muromachi period ( around the year 1450 ) . Together with the other numbered names like Kamakura 's Ten Wells and Kamakura 's Ten Bridges , the modern Seven Entrances is an Edo period invention probably concocted to stimulate tourism . The Azuma Kagami calls them simply -zaka : Kobukurozaka , Daibutsuzaka , Gokurakuzaka , etc . Besides these seven , there were always other mountain roads that connected Kamakura with , for example , Kotsubo and Shichirigahama . There is one , for example , that connects Kaiz\u014d-ji in \u014cgigayatsu with Kita-Kamakura Station . The Seven Entrances were simply the most convenient and important . While economically vital because they allowed traffic to and from the outside world , the Seven Passes had also great military value , and as such they were fortified in various ways , for example narrowing them further until a horse could barely pass through , and obstructing the view of incomers . The roads were also modified adding artificial cliffs and forts from which archers could hit enemies below .",
