  "/wiki/International_Nonproprietary_Name": "The international nonproprietary name ( INN ) is an official generic and non-proprietary name given to a pharmaceutical drug or an active ingredient . INNs make communication more precise by providing a unique standard name for each active ingredient , to avoid prescribing errors . The INN system has been coordinated by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) since 1953 . Having unambiguous standard names for each drug ( standardization of drug nomenclature ) is important because a drug may be sold by many different brand names , or a branded medication may contain more than one drug . For example , the branded medications Celexa , Celapram and Citrol all contain the same active ingredient : citalopram ; and the antibiotic widely known by the brand name Bactrim contains two active ingredients : trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole . This combination of two antibiotic agents in one tablet has been available as a generic for decades , but the brand names Bactrim and Septra are still in common use . Each drug 's INN is unique but may contain a word stem that is shared with other drugs of the same class ; for example , the beta blocker drugs propranolol and atenolol share the -olol suffix , and the benzodiazepine drugs lorazepam and diazepam share the -azepam suffix . The WHO issues INNs in English , Latin , French , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , and Chinese , and a drug 's INNs are often cognate across most or all of the languages , with minor spelling or pronunciation differences , for example : paracetamol ( en ) paracetamolum ( la ) , parac\u00e9tamol ( fr ) and \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b ( ru ) . An established INN is known as a recommended INN ( rINN ) , while a name that is still being considered is called a proposed INN ( pINN ) .",
  "/wiki/Indication_(medicine)": "In medicine , an indication is a valid reason to use a certain test , medication , procedure , or surgery . There can be multiple indications to use a procedure or medication . An indication can commonly be confused with the term diagnosis . A diagnosis is a particular [ medical ] condition while an indication is a reason for use . The opposite of an indication is a contraindication , a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment because the risks of treatment clearly outweigh the benefits . In the United States , indications for prescription drugs are approved by the FDA . Indications are included in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the Prescribing Information . The primary role of the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of labeling is to enable health care practitioners to readily identify appropriate therapies for patients by clearly communicating the drugs approved indication ( s ) . The INDICATIONS AND USAGE section states the disease or condition , or manifestation or symptoms thereof , for which the drug is approved , as well as whether the drug is indicated for the treatment , prevention , mitigation , cure , relief , or diagnosis of that disease or condition . Additionally , the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section should contain the approved age groups as well as other information necessary to describe appropriate use ( e.g. , identifying the indicated patient/disease subgroups , stating if adjunctive therapy is required ) .",
  "/wiki/Aripiprazole": "Aripiprazole , sold under the brand name Abilify among others , is an atypical antipsychotic . It is primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . Other uses include as an add-on treatment in major depressive disorder , tic disorders and irritability associated with autism . It is taken by mouth or injection into a muscle . A Cochrane review found only low quality evidence of effectiveness in treating schizophrenia . Additionally , since many people dropped out of the studies before they were completed , the strength of the conclusions was low . Common side effects include vomiting , constipation , sleepiness , dizziness , weight gain and movement disorders . Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia and anaphylaxis . It is not recommended for older people with dementia-related psychosis due to an increased risk of death . In pregnancy , there is evidence of possible harm to the baby . It is not recommended in women who are breastfeeding . It has not been very well studied in people less than 18 years old .",
  "/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic": "The atypical antipsychotics ( AAP ; also known as second generation antipsychotics ( SGAs ) ) are a group of antipsychotic drugs ( antipsychotic drugs in general are also known as major tranquilizers and neuroleptics , although the latter is usually reserved for the typical antipsychotics ) largely introduced after the 1970s and used to treat psychiatric conditions . Some atypical antipsychotics have received regulatory approval ( e.g . by the FDA of the US , the TGA of Australia , the MHRA of the UK ) for schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , autism , and as an adjunct in major depressive disorder . Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain 's dopamine pathways . Atypicals are less likely than haloperidol - the most widely used typical antipsychotic - to cause extrapyramidal motor control disabilities in patients such as unsteady Parkinson 's disease-type movements , body rigidity , and involuntary tremors . However , only a few of the atypicals have been demonstrated to be superior to lesser-used , low-potency first-generation antipsychotics in this regard . As experience with these agents has grown , several studies have questioned the utility of broadly characterizing antipsychotic drugs as atypical/second generation as opposed to first generation , noting that each agent has its own efficacy and side-effect profile . It has been argued that a more nuanced view in which the needs of individual patients are matched to the properties of individual drugs is more appropriate . Although atypical antipsychotics are thought to be safer than typical antipsychotics , they still have severe side effects , including tardive dyskinesia ( a serious movement disorder ) , neuroleptic malignant syndrome , and increased risk of stroke , sudden cardiac death , blood clots , and diabetes . Significant weight gain may occur . Critics have argued that the time has come to abandon the terms first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics , as they do not merit this distinction .",
  "/wiki/Schizophrenia": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by relapsing episodes of psychosis . Major symptoms include hallucinations ( often hearing voices ) and delusions ( having beliefs not shared by others ) . Other symptoms include disordered thinking , social withdrawal , decreased emotional expression , and lack of motivation . Symptoms typically come on gradually , begin in young adulthood , and in many cases never resolve . There is no objective diagnostic test ; diagnosis is based on observed behavior , a history that includes the person 's reported experiences , and reports of others familiar with the person . To be diagnosed with schizophrenia , symptoms and functional impairment need to be present for six months . Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders that may include an anxiety disorder such as panic disorder , obsessive-compulsive disorder , depressive disorder , or a substance use disorder . About 0.3% to 0.7% of people are affected by schizophrenia during their lifetimes . In 2017 , there were an estimated 1.1 million new cases and a total of 19.8 million cases globally . Males are more often affected and onset is on average earlier in age . The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors . Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city , cannabis use during adolescence , infections , the ages of a person 's parents , and poor nutrition during pregnancy .",

  "/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_B": "Monoamine oxidase B , also known as MAOB , is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MAOB gene . The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the flavin monoamine oxidase family . It is an enzyme located in the outer mitochondrial membrane . It catalyzes the oxidative deamination of biogenic and xenobiotic amines and plays an important role in the catabolism of neuroactive and vasoactive amines in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues ( such as dopamine ) .

Early in the disease , the most obvious symptoms are shaking , rigidity , slowness of movement , and difficulty with walking . Thinking and behavioral problems may also occur . Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease . Depression and anxiety are also common , occurring in more than a third of people with PD . Other symptoms include sensory , sleep , and emotional problems . The main motor symptoms are collectively called parkinsonism , or a parkinsonian syndrome . The cause of Parkinson 's disease is unknown , but is believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors . Those with a family member affected are more likely to get the disease themselves . There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries , while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea .",

  "/wiki/Serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor": "A serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRI ) is a type of drug which acts as a reuptake inhibitor of the neurotransmitter serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) ) by blocking the action of the serotonin transporter ( SERT ) . This in turn leads to increased extracellular concentrations of serotonin and , therefore , an increase in serotonergic neurotransmission . It is a type of monoamine reuptake inhibitor ( MRI ) ; other types of MRIs include dopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors . SRIs are not synonymous with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , as the latter term is usually used to describe the class of antidepressants of the same name , and because SRIs , unlike SSRIs , can either be selective or non-selective in their action . For example , cocaine , which non-selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin , norepinephrine , and dopamine , is an SRI but not an SSRI . SRIs are used predominantly as antidepressants ( e.g. , SSRIs , SNRIs , and TCAs ) , though they are also commonly used in the treatment of other psychological conditions such as anxiety disorders and eating disorders . Less often , SRIs are also used to treat a variety of other medical conditions including neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia ( e.g. , duloxetine , milnacipran ) , and premature ejaculation ( e.g. , dapoxetine ) as well as for dieting ( e.g. , sibutramine ) . Additionally , some clinically used drugs such as chlorpheniramine , dextromethorphan , and methadone possess SRI properties secondarily to their primary mechanism of action ( s ) and this contributes to their side effect and drug interaction profiles . A closely related type of drug is a serotonin releasing agent ( SRA ) , an example of which is fenfluramine .",
  "/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder": "Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , also known simply as depression , is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is present across most situations . It is often accompanied by low self-esteem , loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities , low energy , and pain without a clear cause . People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others can not . Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal , while others nearly always have symptoms present . Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person 's personal life , work life , or education , as well as sleeping , eating habits , and general health . About 2-8% of adults with major depression die by suicide , and about 50% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder . The cause is believed to be a combination of genetic , environmental , and psychological factors . Risk factors include a family history of the condition , major life changes , certain medications , chronic health problems , and substance abuse . About 40% of the risk appears to be related to genetics . The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person 's reported experiences and a mental status examination . There is no laboratory test for major depression . Testing , however , may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms .",

  "/wiki/SSRI": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) are a class of drugs that are typically used as antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders . SSRIs function by increasing the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by limiting its reabsorption ( reuptake ) into the presynaptic cell , increasing the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft available to bind to the postsynaptic receptor . They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other monoamine transporters , with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters . SSRIs are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in many countries . The efficacy of SSRIs in mild or moderate cases of depression has been disputed and may be outweighed by side effects .",
  "/wiki/Anxiety_disorders": "Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear . Anxiety is a worry about future events , and fear is a reaction to current events . These feelings may cause physical symptoms , such as a fast heart rate and shakiness .

  "/wiki/Enantiomer": "In chemistry , an enantiomer ( /\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6nti\u0259m\u0259r , \u025b- , -tio\u028a-/ \u0259-NAN-tee-\u0259-m\u0259r ; from Greek \u1f10\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ( en\u00e1ntios ) , meaning 'opposite ' , and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ( m\u00e9ros ) , meaning 'part ' ) ( archaically termed optical isomer , antipode , or optical antipode ) is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable ( not identical ) , much as one 's left and right hands are mirror images of each other that can not appear identical simply by reorientation . A single chiral atom or similar structural feature in a compound causes that compound to have two possible structures which are non-superposable , each a mirror image of the other . Each member of the pair is termed an enantiomorph ( enantio = opposite ; morph = form ) ; the structural property is termed enantiomerism . The presence of multiple chiral features in a given compound increases the number of geometric forms possible , though there may still be some perfect-mirror-image pairs . A sample of a chemical is considered enantiopure ( also termed enantiomerically pure ) when it has , within the limits of detection , molecules of only one chirality . When present in a symmetric environment , enantiomers have identical chemical and physical properties except for their ability to rotate plane-polarized light ( +/\u2212 ) by equal amounts but in opposite directions ( although the polarized light can be considered an asymmetric medium ) . Such compounds are therefore described as optically active , with specific terms for each enantiomer based on the direction : a dextrorotatory compound rotates light a clockwise ( + ) direction whereas a levorotatory compound rotates light in a counter-clockwise ( - ) direction . A mixture of equal number of both enantiomers is called a racemic mixture or a racemate . In a racemic mixture , the amount of positive rotation is exactly counteracted by the equal amount of negative rotation , so the net rotation is zero ( the mixture is not optically active ) . For all intents and purposes , pairs of enantiomers have the same Gibbs free energy . However , theoretical physics predicts that due to parity violation of the weak nuclear force ( the only force in nature that can tell left from right ) , there is actually a minute difference in energy between enantiomers ( on the order of 10\u221212 eV or 10\u221210 kJ/mol or less ) due to the weak neutral current mechanism . This difference in energy is far smaller than energy changes caused by even a trivial change in molecular conformation and far too small to measure by current technology , and is therefore chemically inconsequential .",

Typical antipsychotics may also be used for the treatment of acute mania , agitation , and other conditions . The first typical antipsychotics to come into medical use were the phenothiazines , namely chlorpromazine which was discovered serendipitously . Another prominent grouping of antipsychotics are the butyrophenones , an example of which would be haloperidol . The newer , second-generation antipsychotics , also known as atypical antipsychotics , have replaced the typical antipsychotics due to the Parkinson-like side effects typicals have . Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain 's dopamine pathways , but atypicals at the time of marketing were claimed to differ from typical antipsychotics in that they are less likely to cause extrapyramidal motor control disabilities in patients , which include unsteady Parkinson 's disease-type movements , body rigidity and involuntary tremors . More recent research has demonstrated the side effect profile of these drugs is similar to older drugs , causing the leading medical journal The Lancet to write in its editorial the time has come to abandon the terms first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics , as they do not merit this distinction .

The prefixes cis and trans are from Latin : this side of and the other side of , respectively . In the context of chemistry , cis indicates that the functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain while trans conveys that functional groups are on opposing sides of the carbon chain . Cis-trans isomers are stereoisomers , that is , pairs of molecules which have the same formula but whose functional groups are rotated into a different orientation in three-dimensional space . It is not to be confused with E-Z isomerism , which is an absolute stereochemical description . In general , stereoisomers contain double bonds that do not rotate , or they may contain ring structures , where the rotation of bonds is restricted or prevented . Cis and trans isomers occur both in organic molecules and in inorganic coordination complexes . Cis and trans descriptors are not used for cases of conformational isomerism where the two geometric forms easily interconvert , such as most open-chain single-bonded structures ; instead , the terms syn and anti are used . The term geometric isomerism is considered by IUPAC to be an obsolete synonym of cis-trans isomerism .",

Serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis , Stevens-Johnson syndrome , misuse , and hallucinations . It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe . The amount of medication used may need to be adjusted in those with kidney or liver problems . It is not recommended in those with an arrhythmia , significant hypertension , or left ventricular hypertrophy . How it works is not entirely clear . One possibility is that it may affect the areas of the brain involved with the sleep cycle . Modafinil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998 . In the United States it is classified as a schedule IV controlled substance .",
  "/wiki/Wakefulness-promoting_agent": "Eugeroics ( originally , eugr\u00e9gorique or eugregoric ) , also known as wakefulness-promoting agents and wakefulness-promoting drugs , are a class of drugs that promote wakefulness and alertness . They are medically indicated for the treatment of certain sleep disorders including excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) in narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . They generally have a very low addictive potential . Eugeroics are also often prescribed off-label for the treatment of EDS in idiopathic hypersomnia , a rare and often debilitating sleep disorder which currently has no official treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Modafinil and armodafinil each act as a selective , weak , atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor ( DRI ) whereas adrafinil acts as a prodrug for modafinil . Other eugeroics include solriamfetol , which acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor ( NDRI ) , and pitolisant , which acts as a histamine 3 ( H\u2083 ) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist .",
  "/wiki/Narcolepsy": "Narcolepsy is a long-term neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles . Symptoms often include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness and brief involuntary sleep episodes . About 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength , known as cataplexy . These experiences can be brought on by strong emotions . Less commonly , there may be vivid hallucinations or an inability to move ( sleep paralysis ) while falling asleep or waking up . People with narcolepsy tend to sleep about the same number of hours per day as people without , but the quality of sleep tends to be lessened . The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown , with potentially several causes . In up to 10% of cases , there is a family history of the disorder . Often , those affected have low levels of the neuropeptide orexin , which may be due to an autoimmune disorder . Trauma , infections , toxins or psychological stress may also play a role . Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and sleep studies , after ruling out other potential causes . Excessive daytime sleepiness can also be caused by other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea , major depressive disorder , anemia , heart failure , drinking alcohol and not getting enough sleep .",
  "/wiki/Shift_work_sleep_disorder": "Shift work sleep disorder ( SWSD ) is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder characterized by insomnia and excessive sleepiness affecting people whose work hours overlap with the typical sleep period . Insomnia can be the difficulty to fall asleep or to wake up before the individual has slept enough . The excessive sleepiness appears when the individual has to be productive , awake and alert . Both symptoms are predominant in SWSD . There are numerous shift work schedules , and they may be permanent , intermittent , or rotating ; consequently , the manifestations of SWSD are quite variable . Most people with different schedules than the ordinary one ( from 8 AM to 6 PM ) might have these symptoms but the difference is that SWSD is continual , long-term lasting and starts to interfere with the individual 's life , like the social life and the professional life .",
  "/wiki/Sleep_apnea": "Sleep apnea , also spelled sleep apnoea , is a sleep disorder where a person has pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep . Each pause can last for a few seconds to a few minutes and they happen many times a night . In the most common form , this follows loud snoring . There may be a choking or snorting sound as breathing resumes . Because the disorder disrupts normal sleep , those affected may experience sleepiness or feel tired during the day . In children it may cause hyperactivity or problems in school . Sleep apnea may be either obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) in which breathing is interrupted by a blockage of air flow , central sleep apnea ( CSA ) in which regular unconscious breath simply stops , or a combination of the two . Obstructive ( OSA ) is the most common form . Risk factors for OSA include being overweight , a family history of the condition , allergies , a small breathing airway , and enlarged tonsils . Some people with sleep apnea are unaware they have the condition . In many cases it is first observed by a family member . Sleep apnea is often diagnosed with an overnight sleep study .",
  "/wiki/Hypopnea": "The most common hypopnea symptom is excessive sleepiness , which results from constant sleep interruption . People with hypopnea due to airflow obstruction often have loud , heavy snoring that is interrupted with choking sounds or loud snorts followed by periods of silence , because not enough air can flow into the lungs through the mouth and nose . The periods of silence can last 20 seconds or longer and can happen many times each hour , resulting in poor sleep and reduced levels of oxygen in the blood . Other symptoms of hypopnea may include depression , forgetfulness , mood or behaviour changes , trouble concentrating , loss of energy , nervousness , and morning headaches . Not all people with hypopnea experience all of these symptoms and not everyone who has these symptoms has hypopnea .",

  "/wiki/Nocturnal_enuresis": "Nocturnal enuresis , also called bedwetting , is involuntary urination while asleep after the age at which bladder control usually begins . Bedwetting in children and adults can result in emotional stress . Complications can include urinary tract infections . Most bedwetting is a developmental delay - not an emotional problem or physical illness . Only a small percentage ( 5 to 10% ) of bedwetting cases have a specific medical cause . Bedwetting is commonly associated with a family history of the condition . Nocturnal enuresis is considered primary ( PNE ) when a child has not yet had a prolonged period of being dry . Secondary nocturnal enuresis ( SNE ) is when a child or adult begins wetting again after having stayed dry . Treatments range from behavioral therapy , such as bedwetting alarms , to medication , such as hormone replacement , and even surgery such as urethral dilatation . Since most bedwetting is simply a developmental delay , most treatment plans aim to protect or improve self-esteem . Treatment guidelines recommend that the physician counsel the parents , warning about psychological consequences caused by pressure , shaming , or punishment for a condition children can not control . Bedwetting is the most common childhood complaint .",
  "/wiki/Clobazam": "Clobazam ( marketed under the brand names Frisium , Urbanyl , Onfi , and Tapclob ) is a benzodiazepine class medication that was patented in 1968 . Clobazam was first synthesized in 1966 and first published in 1969 . Clobazam was originally marketed as an anxioselective anxiolytic since 1970 and an anticonvulsant since 1984 . The primary drug-development goal was to provide greater anxiolytic , anti-obsessive efficacy with fewer benzodiazepine-related side effects .",
  "/wiki/Benzodiazepine": "Benzodiazepines ( BZD , BDZ , BZs ) , sometimes called benzos , are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring . The first such drug , chlordiazepoxide ( Librium ) , was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955 , and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann-La Roche , which , since 1963 , has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam ( Valium ) . In 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications . They are in the family of drugs commonly known as minor tranquilizers . Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) at the GABAA receptor , resulting in sedative , hypnotic ( sleep-inducing ) , anxiolytic ( anti-anxiety ) , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant properties . High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation . These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety , insomnia , agitation , seizures , muscle spasms , alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures . Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short , intermediary , or long-acting . Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia ; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety . Benzodiazepines are generally viewed as safe and effective for short-term use , although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur . A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic . Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide .",
  "/wiki/Anticonvulsant": "Anticonvulsants ( also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs ) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures . Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder , since many seem to act as mood stabilizers , and for the treatment of neuropathic pain . Anticonvulsants suppress the excessive rapid firing of neurons during seizures . Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain . Conventional antiepileptic drugs may block sodium channels or enhance \u03b3-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) function . Several antiepileptic drugs have multiple or uncertain mechanisms of action . Next to the voltage-gated sodium channels and components of the GABA system , their targets include GABAA receptors , the GAT-1 GABA transporter , and GABA transaminase . Additional targets include voltage-gated calcium channels , SV2A , and \u03b12\u03b4 . By blocking sodium or calcium channels , antiepileptic drugs reduce the release of excitatory glutamate , whose release is considered to be elevated in epilepsy , but also that of GABA . This is probably a side effect or even the actual mechanism of action for some antiepileptic drugs , since GABA can itself , directly or indirectly , act proconvulsively . Another potential target of antiepileptic drugs is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha . The drug class was the fifth-best-selling in the United States in 2007 .",
  "/wiki/Anxiolytic": "An anxiolytic ( also antipanic or antianxiety agent ) is a medication , or other intervention , that inhibits anxiety . This effect is in contrast to anxiogenic agents , which increase anxiety . Together these categories of psychoactive compounds or interventions may be referred to as anxiotropic compounds or agents . Some recreational drugs such as alcohol induce anxiolysis initially ; however , studies show that many of these drugs are anxiogenic . Anxiolytic medications have been used for the treatment of anxiety disorder and its related psychological and physical symptoms . Light therapy and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect . Beta-receptor blockers such as propranolol and oxprenolol , although not anxiolytics , can be used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety such as tachycardia and palpitations . Anxiolytics are also known as minor tranquilizers . The term is less common in modern texts and was originally derived from a dichotomy with major tranquilizers , also known as neuroleptics or antipsychotics . There are concerns that some GABAergics , such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates , may have an anxiogenic effect if used over long periods of time .",

It is characterized by multiple and concurrent seizure types , cognitive dysfunction , and slow spike waves on electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . Typically , it presents in children aged 3-5 years and can persist into adulthood . It has been associated with several gene mutations , perinatal insults , congenital infections , brain tumors/malformations , and genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis and West syndrome . The prognosis for LGS is poor with a 5% mortality in childhood and persistent seizures into adulthood ( 80-90% ) . LGS was named for neurologists William G.

  "/wiki/Nalmefene": "Nalmefene ( originally known as nalmetrene ; trade name Selincro ) is an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence . It has also been investigated for the treatment of other addictions such as pathological gambling . Nalmefene is an opiate derivative similar in both structure and activity to the opioid antagonist naltrexone . Advantages of nalmefene relative to naltrexone include longer half-life , greater oral bioavailability , and no observed dose-dependent liver toxicity . Like other drugs of this type , nalmefene may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in patients who are dependent on opioid drugs , or more rarely when used post-operatively , to counteract the effects of strong opioids used in surgery .",
  "/wiki/Opioid_antagonist": "An opioid antagonist , or opioid receptor antagonist , is a receptor antagonist that acts on one or more of the opioid receptors . Naloxone and naltrexone are commonly used opioid antagonist drugs which are competitive antagonists that bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists but do not activate the receptors . This effectively blocks the receptor , preventing the body from responding to opioids and endorphins . Some opioid antagonists are not pure antagonists but do produce some weak opioid partial agonist effects , and can produce analgesic effects when administered in high doses to opioid-naive individuals . Examples of such compounds include nalorphine and levallorphan . However , the analgesic effects from these specific drugs are limited and tend to be accompanied by dysphoria , most likely due to additional agonist action at the \u03ba-opioid receptor . As they induce opioid withdrawal effects in people who are taking , or have recently used , opioid full agonists , these drugs are generally considered to be antagonists for practical purposes . [ citation needed ] The weak partial agonist effect can be useful for some purposes , and has previously been used for purposes such as long-term maintenance of former opioid addicts using nalorphine , however it can also have disadvantages such as worsening respiratory depression in patients who have overdosed on non-opioid sedatives such as alcohol or barbiturates . On the other hand , Naloxone has no partial agonist effects , and is in fact a partial inverse agonist at \u03bc-opioid receptors , and so is the preferred antidote drug for treating opioid overdose . Naltrexone is also a partial inverse agonist , and this property is exploited in treatment of opioid addiction , as a sustained course of low-dose naltrexone can reverse the altered homeostasis which results from long-term abuse of opioid agonist drugs . This is the only treatment available which can reverse the long-term after effects of opioid addiction known as post acute withdrawal syndrome , which otherwise tends to produce symptoms such as depression and anxiety that may lead to eventual relapse . A course of low-dose naltrexone is thus often used as the final step in the treatment of opioid addiction after the patient has been weaned off the substitute agonist such as methadone or buprenorphine , in order to restore homeostasis and minimize the risk of post acute withdrawal syndrome once the maintenance agonist has been withdrawn .",
  "/wiki/Alcoholism": "Alcoholism , also known as alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) , is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems . The disorder was previously divided into two types : alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence . In a medical context , alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions are present : a person drinks large amounts of alcohol over a long time period , has difficulty cutting down , acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time , alcohol is strongly desired , usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities , usage results in social problems , usage results in health problems , usage results in risky situations , withdrawal occurs when stopping , and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use . Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex , among other things . Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body , but it particularly affects the brain , heart , liver , pancreas and immune system . This can result in mental illness , Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome , irregular heartbeat , an impaired immune response , liver cirrhosis and increased cancer risk , among other diseases . Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders . Women are generally more sensitive than men to the harmful physical and mental effects of alcohol . Environmental factors and genetics are two components associated with alcoholism , with about half the risk attributed to each . Someone with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to become an alcoholic themselves . Environmental factors include social , cultural and behavioral influences . High stress levels and anxiety , as well as alcohol 's inexpensive cost and easy accessibility , increase the risk .",

Symptoms typically begin around six hours following the last drink , are worst at 24 to 72 hours , and improve by seven days . Alcohol withdrawal may occur in those who are alcohol dependent . This may occur following a planned or unplanned decrease in alcohol intake . The underlying mechanism involves a decreased responsiveness of GABA receptors in the brain . The withdrawal process is typically followed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale ( CIWA-Ar ) .

It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries . In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have ovaries , menopause may be considered to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell . Following the removal of the uterus , symptoms typically occur earlier , at an average of 45 years of age . In the years before menopause , a woman 's periods typically become irregular , which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow .
