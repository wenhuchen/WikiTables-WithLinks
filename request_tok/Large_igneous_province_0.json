It shares borders with Eritrea to the north , Djibouti to the northeast , Somalia , and the de facto state of Somaliland to the east , Kenya to the south , South Sudan to the west and Sudan to the northwest . With over 109 million inhabitants , Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent with a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres ( 420,000 sq mi ) . Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .

  "/wiki/Iceland_hotspot": "The Iceland hotspot is a hotspot which is partly responsible for the high volcanic activity which has formed the Iceland Plateau and the island of Iceland . Iceland is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world , with eruptions occurring on average roughly every three years ( in the 20th century there were 39 volcanic eruptions on and around Iceland ) . [ citation needed ] About a third of the basaltic lavas erupted in recorded history have been produced by Icelandic eruptions . Notable eruptions have included that of Eldgj\u00e1 , a fissure of Katla , in 934 ( the world 's largest basaltic eruption ever witnessed ) , Laki in 1783 ( the world 's second largest ) , and several eruptions beneath ice caps , which have generated devastating glacial bursts , most recently in 2010 after the eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull . Iceland 's location astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , where the Eurasian and North American Plates are moving apart , is partly responsible for this intense volcanic activity , but an additional cause is necessary to explain why Iceland is a substantial island while the rest of the ridge mostly consists of seamounts , with peaks below sea level . As well as being a region of higher temperature than the surrounding mantle , it is believed to have a higher concentration of water . The presence of water in magma reduces the melting temperature , which may also play a role in enhancing Icelandic volcanism .",

The Chagos-Laccadive Ridge and the southern part of the Mascarene Plateau are volcanic traces of the R\u00e9union hotspot . The hotspot is believed to have been active for over 65 million years . A huge eruption of this hotspot 65 million years ago is thought to have laid down the Deccan Traps , a vast bed of basalt lava that covers part of central India , and opened a rift which separated India from the Seychelles Plateau . The Deccan Traps eruption coincided roughly with the nearly antipodal Chicxulub impactor and the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction of the dinosaurs , and there is considerable speculation that the three events were related . As the Indian plate drifted north , the hotspot continued to punch through the plate , creating a string of volcanic islands and undersea plateaux . The Laccadive Islands , the Maldives , and the Chagos Archipelago are atolls resting on former volcanoes created 60-45 million years ago that subsequently submerged below sea level . About 45 million years ago the Central Indian Ridge crossed over the hotspot , and the hotspot passed under the African Plate . The hotspot appears to have been relatively quiet 45-10 million years ago , when activity resumed , creating the Mascarene Islands , which include Mauritius , R\u00e9union , and Rodrigues .

It is approximately 5,000 kilometres ( 3,100 mi ) in length and can be traced topographically from the Bay of Bengal southward towards the Southeast Indian Ridge ( SEIR ) , though the feature continues to the north where it is hidden beneath the sediments of the Bengal Fan . The ridge extends between latitudes 33\u00b0S and 17\u00b0N and has an average width of 200 km . The ridge divides the Indian Ocean into the West and East Indian Ocean . The northeastern side is named the Wharton Basin and ceases at the western end of the Diamantina Fracture Zone which passes to the east and almost to the Australian continent . The ridge is primarily composed of Ocean Island Tholeiites ( OIT ) , a subset of basalt which increase in age from approximately 43.2 \u00b1 0.5 Ma in the south to 81.8 \u00b1 2.6 Ma in the north though a more recent analysis using modern Ar-Ar techniques is currently pending [ needs update ] publication . This age progression has led geologists to theorize that a hotspot in the mantle beneath the Indo-Australian Plate created the ridge as the plate has moved northward in the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic . This theory is supported by a detailed analysis of the chemistry of the Kerguelen Plateau and Rajmahal Traps , which together , geologists believe , represent the flood basalts erupted at the initiation of volcanism at the Kerguelen hotspot which was then sheared in two as the Indian subcontinent moved northward . However , the existence of so-called deep mantle hotspots is currently a topic of debate in the geologic community , with a few geochemists favoring an alternative hypothesis which postulates a much shallower origin for hotspot volcanism . The ridge has been surveyed several times in the past , including several times by the Deep Sea Drilling Program ( DSDP ) . In 2007 , the RV Roger Revelle collected bathymetric , magnetic and seismic data together with dredge samples from nine sites along the ridge as part of an Integrated Ocean Drilling Program ( IODP ) site survey intended to examine the hotspot hypothesis for the ridge .

Chon-Aike had a peak between 183 to 173 Ma but produced continued magmatism between 168 to 141 Ma . By 184 to 175 Ma the Karoo magmatism had spread to Namibia , Lesotho , Lebombo , and the Ferrar province in Antarctica . The Karoo LIP ended 145 Ma with peripheral eruptions in Patagonia , the Antarctica Peninsula , northern South Africa , Kerala in India , and southeast Australia . The Karoo Province uplifted southern Africa c. 1.5 km ( 0.93 mi ) and broke East Gondwana ( India , Antarctica , and Australia ) away from West Gondwana ( South America and Africa ) beginning in the opening of the Weddell Sea .",
  "/wiki/Antarctica": "Antarctica ( /\u00e6n\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0rt\u026ak\u0259/ or /\u00e6nt\u02c8\u0251\u02d0rkt\u026ak\u0259/ ( listen ) ) [ note 1 ] is Earth 's southernmost continent . It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere , almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle , and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean . At 14,200,000 square kilometres ( 5,500,000 square miles ) , it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia . At 0.00008 people per square kilometre , it is by far the least densely populated continent . About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km ( 1.2 mi ; 6,200 ft ) in thickness , which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula . Antarctica , on average , is the coldest , driest , and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents . Most of Antarctica is a polar desert , with annual precipitation of 200 mm ( 7.9 in ) along the coast and far less inland ; there has been no rain there for almost 2 million years , yet 80% of the world freshwater reserves are stored there . The temperature in Antarctica has reached \u221289.2 \u00b0C ( \u2212128.6 \u00b0F ) ( or even \u221294.7 \u00b0C ( \u2212135.8 \u00b0F ) as measured from space ) , though the average for the third quarter ( the coldest part of the year ) is \u221263 \u00b0C ( \u221281 \u00b0F ) . Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at research stations scattered across the continent . Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae , bacteria , fungi , plants , protista , and certain animals , such as mites , nematodes , penguins , seals and tardigrades . Vegetation , where it occurs , is tundra . Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered , unseen until 1820 when the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the Fimbul ice shelf .",
  "/wiki/New_Zealand": "New Zealand ( M\u0101ori : Aotearoa [ a\u0254\u02c8t\u025ba\u027e\u0254a ] ) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . The country has two main landmasses - the North Island ( Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui ) , and the South Island ( Te Waipounamu ) - and around 600 smaller islands . It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",
  "/wiki/Marion_Island": "The Prince Edward Islands are two small islands in the sub-antarctic Indian Ocean that are part of South Africa . The islands are named Marion Island ( named after Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne ) and Prince Edward Island ( named after Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn ) . The islands in the group have been declared Special Nature Reserves under the South African Environmental Management : Protected Areas Act , No . 57 of 2003 , and activities on the islands are therefore restricted to research and conservation management . Further protection was granted when the area was declared a marine protected area in 2013 . The only human inhabitants of the islands are the staff of a meteorological and biological research station run by the South African National Antarctic Programme on Marion Island .",

  "/wiki/Gal\u00e1pagos_hotspot": "The Gal\u00e1pagos hotspot is a volcanic hotspot in the East Pacific Ocean responsible for the creation of the Galapagos Islands as well as three major aseismic ridge systems , Carnegie , Cocos and Malpelo which are on two tectonic plates . The hotspot is located near the Equator on the Nazca Plate not far from the divergent plate boundary with the Cocos Plate . The tectonic setting of the hotspot is complicated by the Galapagos Triple Junction of the Nazca and Cocos plates with the Pacific Plate . The movement of the plates over the hotspot is determined not solely by the spreading along the ridge but also by the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and the Cocos and Nazca Plates . The hotspot is believed to be over 20 million years old and in that time there has been interaction between the hotspot , both of these plates , and the divergent plate boundary , at the Galapagos Spreading Centre . Lavas from the hotspot do not exhibit the homogeneous nature of many hotspots ; instead there is evidence of four major reservoirs feeding the hotspot . These mix to varying degrees at different locations on the archipelago and also within the Galapagos Spreading Centre .",
  "/wiki/Mackenzie_Large_Igneous_Province": "The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province ( MLIP ) is a major Mesoproterozoic large igneous province of the southwestern , western and northwestern Canadian Shield in Canada . It consists of a group of related igneous rocks that were formed during a massive igneous event starting about 1,270 million years ago . The large igneous province extends from the Arctic in Nunavut to near the Great Lakes in Northwestern Ontario where it meets with the smaller Matachewan dike swarm . Included in the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are the large Muskox layered intrusion , the Coppermine River flood basalt sequence and the massive northwesterly trending Mackenzie dike swarm . As a large igneous province , it is an extremely large area of related igneous rocks that were emplaced over an extremely short geological time span . The igneous rocks comprising the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province originated from processes not associated with normal plate tectonics and seafloor spreading . It is one of the several large igneous provinces scattered throughout the Canadian landscape , which can be thousands of kilometres in volume and area . The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province is one of the world 's largest Proterozoic magmatic provinces , as well as one of the most well-preserved continental flood basalt terrains on Earth . Igneous rocks of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are generally mafic in composition , including basalt and gabbro . Even though the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province is classified as a large igneous province like other extremely large accumulations of igneous rocks on Earth , it is much larger than large igneous province standards . The standard size classification for large igneous provinces is a minimum areal extent of 100,000 km2 ( 39,000 sq mi ) . However , the Mackenzie dike swarm itself occupies an area of at least 2,700,000 km2 ( 1,000,000 sq mi ) , making the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province larger than the Ontong Java Plateau ( in the southwestern Pacific Ocean ) and the U.S. state of Alaska .",
  "/wiki/Canadian_Shield": "The Canadian Shield , also called the Laurentian Plateau , or Bouclier canadien ( French ) , is a large area of exposed Precambrian igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks ( geological shield ) that forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent ( the North American Craton or Laurentia ) . Composed of igneous rock resulting from its long volcanic history , the area is covered by a thin layer of soil . With a deep , common , joined bedrock region in eastern and central Canada , it stretches north from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean , covering over half of Canada ; it also extends south into the northern reaches of the United States . Human population is sparse , and industrial development is minimal , while mining is prevalent .",
