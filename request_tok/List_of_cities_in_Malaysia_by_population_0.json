  "/wiki/Miri,_Malaysia": "Miri /\u02c8m\u026ari\u02d0/ is a coastal city in northeastern Sarawak , Malaysia , located near the border of Brunei , on the island of Borneo . The city covers an area of 997.43 square kilometres ( 385.11 sq mi ) , located 798 kilometres ( 496 mi ) northeast of Kuching and 329 kilometres ( 204 mi ) southwest of Kota Kinabalu . Miri is the second largest city in Sarawak , with a population of 234,541 as of 2010 . The city is also the capital of Miri District of the Miri Division . Before Miri was founded , Marudi was the administrative centre of the northern region of Sarawak . Miri was founded in 1910 when the first oil well was drilled by Royal Dutch Shell . The discovery of an oil field in Miri has led to rapid development of Miri town . Miri became the administrative centre of the northern region of Sarawak by 1929 . During World War II , the Miri oil fields were destroyed by the Brooke government to sabotage Japanese operations in Southeast Asia but to no avail ; Miri town was the first landing point of Japanese troops in Borneo . The subsequent Japanese occupation led Miri to become a target of Allied air raids which caused the destruction of oil refinery facilities in Miri . The petroleum industry continued to be a major player in the city 's economy after the war . Oil exploration has moved offshore since the 1950s , but subsequently new inland oil fields were found in 1989 and 2011 ."
