  "/wiki/Night_and_Fog_(1955_film)": "Night and Fog ( French : Nuit et brouillard ) is a 1956 French documentary short film . Directed by Alain Resnais , it was made ten years after the liberation of German concentration camps . The title is taken from the Nacht und Nebel ( German for Night and Fog ) program of abductions and disappearances decreed by Nazi Germany . The documentary features the abandoned grounds of Auschwitz and Majdanek established in occupied Poland while describing the lives of prisoners in the camps . Night and Fog was made in collaboration with scriptwriter Jean Cayrol , a survivor of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp . The music of the soundtrack was composed by Hanns Eisler . Resnais was originally hesitant about making the film and refused the offer to make it until Cayrol was contracted to write the script . The film was shot entirely in the year 1955 and is composed of contemporary shots of the camps plus stock footage . Resnais and Cayrol found the film very difficult to make due to its graphic nature and subject matter . The film faced difficulties with French censors unhappy with a shot of a French police officer in the film , and with the German embassy in France , which attempted to halt the film 's release at the Cannes Film Festival . Night and Fog was released to critical acclaim , and still receives very high praise today . It was re-shown on French television nationwide in 1990 to remind the people of the horrors of war .",
  "/wiki/Alain_Resnais": "Alain Resnais ( French : [ al\u025b\u0303 \u0281\u025bn\u025b ] ; 3 June 1922 - 1 March 2014 ) was a French film director and screenwriter whose career extended over more than six decades . After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s , he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog ( 1956 ) , an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps . Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour ( 1959 ) , Last Year at Marienbad ( 1961 ) , and Muriel ( 1963 ) , all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past . These films were contemporary with , and associated with , the French New Wave ( la nouvelle vague ) , though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement . He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics . He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol , Marguerite Duras , Alain Robbe-Grillet , Jorge Sempr\u00fan and Jacques Sternberg . In later films , Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms , including theatre , music , and comic books . This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn , Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh , as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song . His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness , memory , and the imagination , and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives . Throughout his career , he won many awards from international film festivals and academies .",
