  "/wiki/Bighorn_River": "The Bighorn River is a tributary of the Yellowstone , approximately 461 miles ( 742 km ) long , in the states of Wyoming and Montana in the western United States . The river was named in 1805 by fur trader Fran\u00e7ois Larocque for the bighorn sheep he saw along its banks as he explored the Yellowstone . The upper reaches of the Bighorn , south of the Owl Creek Mountains in Wyoming , are known as the Wind River . The two rivers are sometimes referred to as the Wind/Bighorn . The Wind River officially becomes the Bighorn River at the Wedding of the Waters , on the north side of the Wind River Canyon near the town of Thermopolis . From there , the river flows through the Bighorn Basin in north central Wyoming , passing through Thermopolis and Hot Springs State Park . At the border with Montana , the river turns northeast , and flows past the north end of the Bighorn Mountains , through the Crow Indian Reservation , where the Yellowtail Dam forms the Bighorn Lake reservoir . The reservoir and the surrounding canyon are part of the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area . The Little Bighorn River joins the Bighorn near the town of Hardin , Montana . Approximately fifty miles farther downriver , the Bighorn River ends where it joins the Yellowstone .",

  "/wiki/Bighorn_Ditch_Headgate": "The Bighorn Ditch Headgate , also known as the Bighorn Canal Headgate , was built starting in 1892 to provide irrigation to the Crow Indian Reservation in south central Montana . The headgate structure diverted water from the Bighorn River to their lands . It was designed by William F. Graves , and construction was carried out by Crow workers . The project was completed in 1904 . Today the site is included in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area . The structure includes a diversion dam extending at an angle into the river to divert water through the headgate into a canal flowing parallel to the river . The headgate structure was built of dressed local limestone , and is 35 feet ( 11 m ) wide , allowing a designed flow of 720 cubic feet ( 20,000 L ) of water per second . Five iron gates controlled the flow . The headgate structure is intermittently inundated by water held in the Yellowtail Dam Afterbay reservoir . The Bighorn Ditch was instrumental to the Crow changing from their nomadic lifestyle to a settled , agrarian society . Their initial attempts at farming in the arid climate , beginning in 1885 , resulted in failure . The government at last recognized that irrigation of the lands would be required for the people to gain consistent yields from their crops .",
