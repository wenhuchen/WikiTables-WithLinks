  "/wiki/1812_New_Madrid_earthquake": "The 1811-12 New Madrid earthquakes ( /\u02c8m\u00e6dr\u026ad/ ) were a series of intense intraplate earthquakes beginning with an initial earthquake of moment magnitude 7.2-8.2 on December 16 , 1811 , followed by a moment magnitude 7.4 aftershock on the same day . Two additional earthquakes of similar magnitude followed in January and February of 1812 . They remain the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States east of the Rocky Mountains in recorded history . The earthquakes , as well as the seismic zone of their occurrence , were named for the Mississippi River town of New Madrid , then part of the Louisiana Territory and now within the U.S. state of Missouri . The epicenters of the earthquakes were located in an area that at the time was at the distant western edge of the American frontier , only sparsely settled by European pioneers . Contemporary accounts have led seismologists to estimate that these stable continental region earthquakes were felt strongly throughout much of the central and eastern United States , across an area of roughly 130,000 square kilometers ( 50,000 sq mi ) , and moderately across nearly 3 million square kilometers ( 1 million sq mi ) . The 1906 San Francisco earthquake , by comparison , was felt moderately over roughly 16,000 km2 ( 6,200 sq mi ) . The New Madrid earthquakes were interpreted variously by American Indian tribes , but one consensus was universally accepted : the powerful earthquake had to have meant something . For many tribes in Tecumseh 's pan-Indian alliance , it meant that Tecumseh and his brother the Prophet must be supported .",
