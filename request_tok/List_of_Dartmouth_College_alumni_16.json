  "/wiki/Newsweek": "Newsweek is an American weekly news magazine founded in 1933 . Newsweek was a widely distributed newsweekly through the 20th century , with many notable editors-in-chief throughout the years . Newsweek was acquired by The Washington Post Company in 1961 , under whose ownership it remained until 2010 . Between 2008 and 2012 , Newsweek experienced financial difficulties , leading to the cessation of print publication and a transition to all-digital format at the end of 2012 . The print edition then relaunched in March 2014 under different ownership . Revenue declines prompted an August 2010 sale by owner The Washington Post Company to audio pioneer Sidney Harman - for a purchase price of one dollar and an assumption of the magazine 's liabilities . Later that year , Newsweek merged with the news and opinion website The Daily Beast , forming The Newsweek Daily Beast Company . Newsweek was jointly owned by the estate of Harman and the diversified American media and Internet company IAC . In 2013 , IBT Media announced it had acquired Newsweek from IAC ; the acquisition included the Newsweek brand and its online publication , but did not include The Daily Beast . IBT Media rebranded itself as Newsweek Media Group in 2017 , but returned to IBT Media in 2018 after making Newsweek independent .",
