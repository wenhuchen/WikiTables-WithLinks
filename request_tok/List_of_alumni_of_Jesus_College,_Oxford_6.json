  "/wiki/Bala-Bangor_Theological_Seminary": "Bala-Bangor was a theological seminary belonging to the Welsh Independents ( Undeb yr Annibynwyr Cymraeg ) , an association of Welsh congregationalists . It was founded in 1841 at Llanuwchllyn , then moved to a permanent location at Bala , Gwynedd in 1842 under the principalship of Michael Jones ( 1787-1853 ) , who was followed by his son Michael D. Jones ( 1822-1898 ) . During Michael D. Jones 's principalship , a row broke out between two rival factions within Welsh congregationalism over the seminary 's constitution - Michael D. Jones and his followers wanted to keep and adhere to the old constitution but Rev . John Thomas of Liverpool and his followers wanted to impose a new constitution upon the seminary . Michael D. Jones 's argument was that Rev . John Thomas 's plan would only lead to the presbyterizing of the seminary and of the Congregational churches in general . This row lead to a split and for a period the Congregationalists had two seminaries in Bala , Thomas Lewis 's seminary at Plasyndre and Michael D. Jones 's at Bodiwan . But by 1886 Thomas Lewis 's seminary had moved to Bangor . Michael D. Jones retired in 1892 and this paved the way to unite the two seminaries once again and this time at Bangor thus explaining the seminary 's eclectic name : Bala-Bangor . The seminary remained in Bangor until its closure in 1989 by which time it was under the principalship of R. Tudur Jones , the last in the distinguished line of Principals to serve the Congregational churches in Wales . The seminary was closed mainly because of lack of demand for two Congregational seminaries in Wales . The Memorial College ( having moved from Brecon to Swansea and then to Aberystwyth ) offered a more central location for a United College to serve the Congregational churches throughout Wales .",

  "/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism": "Tibetan Buddhism ( also Indo-Tibetan Buddhism ) is the form of Buddhism practiced in Tibet where it is the dominant religion . It is also found in the regions surrounding the Himalayas ( such as Bhutan , Ladakh , and Sikkim ) , much of Chinese Central Asia , the Southern Siberian regions such as Tuva , as well as Mongolia . Tibetan Buddhism is a form of Mahayana Buddhism stemming from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism ( and so is also part of the tantric Vajrayana tradition ) . It thus preserves the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India . However , it also includes native Tibetan developments and practices . In the pre-modern era , Tibetan Buddhism spread outside of Tibet primarily due to the influence of the Mongol Yuan dynasty ( 1271-1368 ) , founded by Kublai Khan , which ruled China , Mongolia and parts of Siberia . In the modern era , it has spread outside of Asia due to the efforts of the Tibetan diaspora . Apart from classical Mahayana Buddhist practices like the six perfections , Tibetan Buddhism also includes Tantric practices , such as deity yoga and the Six Dharmas of Naropa . Its main goal is Buddhahood or rainbow body . The main language of scriptural study in this tradition is classical Tibetan . Tibetan Buddhism has four major schools , namely Nyingma , Kagyu , Sakya and Gelug . The Jonang is a smaller school , and the Rim\u00e9 movement is a recent nonsectarian movement which cuts across the different schools .",

His writings cover many subjects - including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theatre , music , rhetoric , psychology , linguistics , economics , politics and government .

As a result , his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion . Little is known about his life . Aristotle was born in the city of Stagira in Northern Greece . His father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a child , and he was brought up by a guardian . At seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined Plato 's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ( c. 347 BC ) .
