  "/wiki/Argentina": "Argentina ( Spanish : [ a\u027exen\u02c8tina ] ) , officially the Argentine Republic [ A ] ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica Argentina ) , is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America . Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",
  "/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches": "The Eastern Catholic Churches or Oriental Catholic Churches , also called the Eastern-rite Catholic Churches , or simply the Eastern Churches and in some historical cases referred to pejoratively as Uniates , [ a ] are twenty-three Eastern Christian sui iuris ( autonomous ) particular churches of the Catholic Church , in full communion with the pope in Rome . They are united with one another and with the Latin or Roman Church ( also known as the Western Church ) . In particular , they recognize the central role of the Bishop of Rome within the College of Bishops and his infallibility when speaking ex cathedra . The majority of the Eastern Catholic Churches are groups from the Eastern Orthodox Church , the Oriental Orthodox churches , and the historic Church of the East that have returned to communion with the Bishop of Rome due to extenuating political and cultural circumstances influencing the churches ' relations . As such the five liturgical traditions of the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches , including the Alexandrian Rite , the Armenian Rite , the Byzantine Rite , the East Syriac Rite , and the West Syriac Rite , are shared with other Eastern Christian churches . Consequently , the Catholic Church consists of six liturgical rites ; including the aforementioned five liturgical traditions of the Eastern Catholic Churches along with the Latin liturgical rites of the Latin Church . Headed by patriarchs , metropolitans , and major archbishops , the Eastern Catholic Churches are governed in accordance with the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches , although each church also has its own canons and laws on top of this , and the preservation of their own traditions is explicitly encouraged . The total membership of the various churches accounts for about 18 million , according to the Annuario Pontificio ( the annual directory of the Catholic Church ) , thus making up about 1.5 percent of the Catholic Church , with the rest of its more than 1.3 billion members belonging to the Latin Church . The Maronite Church is considered the only one of the Eastern Catholic Churches to have always remained in full communion with the Holy See , while most of the other churches unified from the 16th century onwards . However , the Melkite Greek Catholic Church and the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church also claim perpetual communion . The largest six churches based on membership are : the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church ( Byzantine Rite ) , the Syro-Malabar Church ( East Syriac Rite ) , the Maronite Church ( West Syriac Rite ) , the Melkite Catholic Church ( Byzantine Rite ) , the Chaldean Catholic Church ( East Syriac Rite ) and the Armenian Catholic Church ( Armenian Rite ) .

The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata , on the South American continent 's southeastern coast . Buenos Aires can be translated as fair winds or good airs , but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century , by the use of the original name Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre , named after the Madonna of Bonaria in Sardinia . The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation , which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts , constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas , with a population of around 15.6 million . The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province 's capital ; rather , it is an autonomous district . In 1880 , after decades of political infighting , Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province . The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores ; both are now neighborhoods of the city . The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy , hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ( Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires ; CABA ) . Its citizens first elected a chief of government ( i.e . mayor ) in 1996 ; previously , the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic . Buenos Aires ' quality of life was ranked 91st in the world in 2018 , being one of the best in Latin America .

In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

The Byzantine Rite was originally developed and used in Greek language and later , with introduction of Eastern Orthodoxy to other ethnic groups it was translated into local languages and continued further development . Historically , most important non-Greek variants of Byzantine Rite are : Byzantine-Slavonic and Byzantine-Georgian . The rite consists of the divine liturgies , canonical hours , forms for the administration of sacred mysteries ( sacraments ) and the numerous prayers , blessings and exorcisms developed by the Church of Constantinople . Also involved are the specifics of church architecture , icons , liturgical music , vestments and traditions which have evolved over the centuries in the Eastern Orthodox Church and which are associated with this rite . Traditionally , the congregation stands throughout the whole service , and an iconostasis separates the sanctuary from the nave of the church . The faithful are very active in their worship , making frequent bows and prostrations , and feeling free to move about the temple ( church ) during the services . Also , traditionally , the major clergy and monks neither shave nor cut their hair or beards . Scripture plays a large role in Byzantine worship , with not only daily readings but also many quotes from the Bible throughout the services . The entire psalter is read each week , and twice weekly during Great Lent . Fasting is stricter than in the Roman Rite .",
