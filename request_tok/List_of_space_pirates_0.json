  "/wiki/Novel": "A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction , normally written in prose form , and which is typically published as a book . The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian novella for new , news , or short story of something new , itself from the Latin novella , a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus , diminutive of novus , meaning new . Walter Scott made a distinction between the novel , in which ( as he saw it ) events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society and the romance , which he defined as a fictitious narrative in prose or verse ; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents . However , many such romances , including the historical romances of Scott , Emily Bront\u00eb 's Wuthering Heights and Herman Melville 's Moby-Dick , are also frequently called novels , and Scott describes romance as a kindred term . This sort of romance is in turn different from the genre fiction love romance or romance novel . Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel : a novel is le roman , der Roman , il romanzo , en roman . Most European languages use the word romance ( as in French , Dutch , Russian , Slovene , Serbo-Croatian , Romanian , Danish , Swedish and Norwegian roman ; Finnish romaani ; German Roman ; Portuguese romance and Italian romanzo ) for extended narratives . The novel constitutes a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years , with its origins in classical Greece and Rome , in medieval and early modern romance , and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance novella . ( Since the 18th century , the term novella , or novelle in German , has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long short story or a short novel . ) Murasaki Shikibu 's Tale of Genji , an early 11th-century Japanese text , has sometimes been described as the world 's first novel , but there is considerable debate over this - there were certainly long fictional works much earlier . Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of classical Chinese novels by the Ming dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) . Parallel European developments occurred after the invention of the printing press .",

Textual devices such as speech balloons , captions , and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue , narration , sound effects , or other information . The size and arrangement of panels contribute to narrative pacing . Cartooning and other forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics ; fumetti is a form which uses photographic images . Common forms include comic strips , editorial and gag cartoons , and comic books . Since the late 20th century , bound volumes such as graphic novels , comic albums , and tank\u014dbon have become increasingly common , while online webcomics have proliferated in the 21st century with the growth of the Internet . The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures . Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings in France . By the mid-20th century , comics flourished , particularly in the United States , western Europe ( especially France and Belgium ) , and Japan . The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer 's cartoon strips of the 1830s , but the medium truly became popular in the 1930s following the success of strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin . American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips ; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s , in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938 .",
  "/wiki/Time_Lord": "The Time Lords are an ancient extraterrestrial species in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , of which the series ' title character protagonist , the Doctor , is a member . Time Lords are so named for their command of time travel technology and their non-linear perception of time . Originally , they were described as a powerful and wise race from the planet Gallifrey , from which the Doctor was a renegade ; details beyond this were very limited for the first decade of the series . They later became integral to many episodes and stories as their role in the universe developed . For the first eight years after the series resumed in 2005 , the Time Lords were said to have been destroyed during the Last Great Time War at some point between the original series ' cancellation in 1989 and the show 's revival . In 2013 , the 50th anniversary special The Day of the Doctor concerned this supposed destruction and their eventual survival . They developed a culture of custodianship and time-related technologies based on this perception which includes strictly controlled space/time travel machines ( known as TARDISes ) and monitoring devices to travel through time and to prevent time from being subverted or abused - although actual action was described as rare in practice due to their traditional policy of strict non-interference and neutrality . They can act to manipulate timelines of a wide range of events and individuals , so long as they do not cross back into their own timeline . Over subsequent episodes their history , their development of time manipulation , and their internal politics were touched upon , with Time Lord society portrayed as a stagnated ceremony-bound oligarchy and their past having descended into myth and legend . The Doctor became at times an ally , being appointed their president during his fourth , fifth , and twelfth incarnations and assisting them on many other occasions .",

The Daleks were conceived by science-fiction writer Terry Nation and first appeared in the 1963 Doctor Who serial The Daleks , in the shells designed by Raymond Cusick . Drawing inspiration from the Nazis , Nation portrayed the Daleks as violent , merciless and pitiless cyborg aliens , who demand total conformity to their will , and who are bent on the conquest of the universe and the extermination of what they see as inferior races . In the programme 's narrative the Daleks were engineered by the scientist Davros during the final years of a thousand-year war between his people , the Kaleds , and their enemies the Thals . With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by nuclear war , Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a tank-like robotic shell , removing their every emotion apart from hate . His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe , intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life . Collectively they are the greatest enemies of Doctor Who 's protagonist , the Time Lord known as the Doctor . Later in the programme 's run the Daleks acquired time travel technology and engaged the Time Lords in a brutal Time War affecting most of the universe , with battles taking place across the whole of history . The Daleks are the show 's most popular and famous villains and their returns to the series over the decades have gained media attention . Their frequent order to Exterminate ! has become common usage .",

In Armageddon 2419 A.D. , published in the August 1928 issue of the pulp magazine Amazing Stories , the character 's given name was Anthony . A sequel , The Airlords of Han , was published in the March 1929 issue . Nowlan was contracted by the syndicate John F. Dille Company ( later known as the National Newspaper Service syndicate ) to adapt the story into a comic strip . After Nowlan and Dille enlisted editorial cartoonist Dick Calkins as the illustrator , Nowlan adapted the first episode from Armageddon 2419 A.D. and changed the hero 's name from Anthony to Buck . The strip made its first newspaper appearance on January 7 , 1929 . Later adaptations included radio in 1932 , a film serial , a television series ( in which his first name was changed from Anthony to William ) , and other formats . The Buck Rogers strip was popular enough to inspire other newspaper syndicates to launch their own science fiction strips . The most famous of these imitators was Flash Gordon ( King Features Syndicate , 1934-2003 ) ; others included Tom Swift ( 1930-1937 ) , Brick Bradford ( Central Press Association , 1933-1987 ) , Don Dixon and the Hidden Empire ( Watkins Syndicate , 1935-1941 ) , Speed Spaulding ( John F.

The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience .

  "/wiki/Cyborg": "A cyborg ( /\u02c8sa\u026ab\u0254\u02d0r\u0261/ ) , short for cybernetic organism , is a being with both organic and biomechatronic body parts . The term was coined in 1960 by Manfred Clynes and Nathan S. Kline . The term cyborg is not the same thing as bionic , biorobot or android ; it applies to an organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of feedback . While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals , including humans , they might also conceivably be any kind of organism . D. S. Halacy 's Cyborg : Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a new frontier that was not merely space , but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space ' to 'outer space ' - a bridge.between mind and matter . In science fiction , the most recognizable portrayal of a cyborg is a human being with visibly mechanical parts , such as the superhero Cyborg from DC Comics or the The Borg from Star Trek . But cyborgs may also be portrayed as looking more like robots or more like ordinary humans . Cyborg may appear as humanoid robots , such as Robotman from DC 's Doom Patrol or the Cybermen from Doctor Who , or they may appear as non-humanoid robots , such as the Daleks in Doctor Who or some of the Motorball players in Battle Angel Alita . More human appearing cyborgs may cover up their mechanical parts with armor or clothing , such as Darth Vader from Star Wars or Misty Knight from Marvel Comics . Cyborgs may even have mechanical parts or bodies that appear human . The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman had bionic parts that looked like the body parts they replaced . Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell is a full-body cyborg whose body looks human .",
  "/wiki/Viking": "Vikings [ a ] were Scandinavians , who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries , raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe , and explored westwards to Iceland , Greenland , and Vinland . The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age , 793-1066 AD . This period of Nordic military , mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia , Estonia , the British Isles , France , Kievan Rus ' and Sicily . Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills , and characterised by the longship , Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral , North Africa , and the Middle East . Following extended phases of ( primarily sea- or river-borne ) exploration , expansion and settlement , Viking ( Norse ) communities and governments were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe , Belarus , Ukraine and European Russia , the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America . This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture , while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself , with profound developmental implications in both directions . Popular , modern conceptions of the Vikings - the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia - often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources . A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century ; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival . Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent , piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century . Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clich\u00e9s and stereotypes , complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy . These representations are not always accurate - for example , there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets , a costuming element that first appeared in Wagnerian opera .",
