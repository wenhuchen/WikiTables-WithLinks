  "/wiki/Property": "Property in the abstract is what belongs to or with something , whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing . In the context of this article , it is one or more components ( rather than attributes ) , whether physical or incorporeal , of a person 's estate ; or so belonging to , as in being owned by , a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society . Depending on the nature of the property , an owner of property has the right to consume , alter , share , redefine , rent , mortgage , pawn , sell , exchange , transfer , give away or destroy it , or to exclude others from doing these things , as well as to perhaps abandon it ; whereas regardless of the nature of the property , the owner thereof has the right to properly use it ( as a durable , mean or factor , or whatever ) , or at the very least exclusively keep it . In economics and political economy , there are three broad forms of property : private property , public property , and collective property ( also called cooperative property ) . Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways , whether simply or complexly , whether equally or unequally . However , there is an expectation that each party 's will ( rather discretion ) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional , [ citation needed ] so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent . The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous , or alternately every given one of them , when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists , may expect his , her , its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute . The Restatement ( First ) of Property defines property as anything , tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing . This mediating relationship between individual , property and state is called a property regime . In sociology and anthropology , property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object , in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object . The distinction between collective property and private property is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object . Important widely recognized types of property include real property ( the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land ) , personal property ( physical possessions belonging to a person ) , private property ( property owned by legal persons , business entities or individual natural persons ) , public property ( state owned or publicly owned and available possessions ) and intellectual property ( exclusive rights over artistic creations , inventions , etc .",
  "/wiki/Hotel": "A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis . Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger , higher-quality beds , a dresser , a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities , upholstered chairs , a flat screen television , and en-suite bathrooms . Small , lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities . Larger , higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool , business centre ( with computers , printers , and other office equipment ) , childcare , conference and event facilities , tennis or basketball courts , gymnasium , restaurants , day spa , and social function services . Hotel rooms are usually numbered ( or named in some smaller hotels and B & Bs ) to allow guests to identify their room . Some boutique , high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms . Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement . In the United Kingdom , a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours . [ citation needed ] In Japan , capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities . The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe . For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century , coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travelers . Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century .",
  "/wiki/Trade": "Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another , often in exchange for money . Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market . An early form of trade , barter , saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services . [ need quotation to verify ] Barter involves trading things without the use of money . When either bartering party started to involve precious metals , these gained symbolic as well as practical importance . [ citation needed ] Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange , such as money . As a result , buying can be separated from selling , or earning . The invention of money ( and later of credit , paper money and non-physical money ) greatly simplified and promoted trade . Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade , while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade . In one modern view , trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor , a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production , but use their output in trades for other products and needs . Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage ( perceived or real ) in the production of some trade-able commodity - including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere . For example : different regions ' sizes may encourage mass production .",
  "/wiki/Automotive_accessories": "The automotive aftermarket is the secondary market of the automotive industry , concerned with the manufacturing , remanufacturing , distribution , retailing , and installation of all vehicle parts , chemicals , equipment , and accessories , after the sale of the automobile by the original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) to the consumer . The parts , accessories , etc . for sale may not be manufactured by the OEM . According to a report by the International Trade Administration in the Department of Commerce , Aftermarket parts are divided into two categories : replacement parts and accessories . Replacement parts are automotive parts built or remanufactured to replace OE parts as they become worn or damaged . Accessories are parts made for comfort , convenience , performance , safety , or customization , and are designed for add-on after the original sale of the motor vehicle . The aftermarket encompasses parts for replacement , collision , appearance , and performance . The aftermarket provides a wide variety of parts of varying qualities and prices for nearly all vehicle makes and models . Consumers have the option of repairing their vehicles themselves ( the do-it-yourself or DIY segment ) or can take the vehicle to a professional repair facility ( the do-it-for me or DIFM segment ) . The aftermarket helps keep vehicles on the road by providing consumers the choice of where they want their vehicles serviced , maintained , or customized .",

  "/wiki/Beer": "Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world . It is also the third most popular drink overall after water and tea . Beer is brewed from cereal grains - most commonly from malted barley , though wheat , maize ( corn ) , and rice are also used . During the brewing process , fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer . Most modern beer is brewed with hops , which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent . Other flavouring agents such as gruit , herbs , or fruits may be included or used instead of hops . In commercial brewing , the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation . Some of humanity 's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer : the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours , and The Hymn to Ninkasi , a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer , served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people . Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught , particularly in pubs and bars . The brewing industry is a global business , consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries . The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume ( ABV ) , although it may vary between 0.5% and 20% , with some breweries creating examples of 40% ABV and above . Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals , as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games .",
  "/wiki/Soft_drink": "A soft drink ( see \u00a7 Terminology for other names ) is a drink that usually contains carbonated water ( although some lemonades are not carbonated ) , a sweetener , and a natural or artificial flavoring . The sweetener may be a sugar , high-fructose corn syrup , fruit juice , a sugar substitute ( in the case of diet drinks ) , or some combination of these . Soft drinks may also contain caffeine , colorings , preservatives , and/or other ingredients . Soft drinks are called soft in contrast with hard alcoholic drinks . Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink , but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink in many countries and localities if the drink is to be considered non-alcoholic . Fruit punch , tea ( even kombucha ) , and other such non-alcoholic drinks are technically soft drinks by this definition , but are not generally referred to as such . Unsweetened sparkling water may be consumed as an alternative to soft drinks . Soft drinks may be served chilled , over ice cubes , or at room temperature , especially soda . They are available in many container formats , including cans , glass bottles , and plastic bottles . Containers come in a variety of sizes , ranging from small bottles to large multi-liter containers . Soft drinks are widely available at fast food restaurants , movie theaters , convenience stores , casual-dining restaurants , dedicated soda stores , and bars from soda fountain machines . Soft drinks are usually served in paper or plastic disposable cups in the first three venues .",
  "/wiki/Investments": "To invest is to allocate money in the expectation of some benefit in the future . In finance , the benefit from an investment is called a return . The return may consist of a gain ( or loss ) realised from the sale of property or an investment , unrealised capital appreciation ( or depreciation ) , or investment income such as dividends , interest , rental income etc. , or a combination of capital gain and income . The return may also include currency gains or losses due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates . Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier their investments .

Investors , particularly novices , are often advised to adopt a particular investment strategy and diversify their portfolio . Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk .",
  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",
  "/wiki/Fluorspar": "Fluorite ( also called fluorspar ) is the mineral form of calcium fluoride , CaF2 . It belongs to the halide minerals . It crystallizes in isometric cubic habit , although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon . The Mohs scale of mineral hardness , based on scratch hardness comparison , defines value 4 as Fluorite . Pure fluorite is transparent , both in visible and ultraviolet light , but impurities usually make it a colorful mineral and the stone has ornamental and lapidary uses . Industrially , fluorite is used as a flux for smelting , and in the production of certain glasses and enamels . The purest grades of fluorite are a source of fluoride for hydrofluoric acid manufacture , which is the intermediate source of most fluorine-containing fine chemicals . Optically clear transparent fluorite lenses have low dispersion , so lenses made from it exhibit less chromatic aberration , making them valuable in microscopes and telescopes . Fluorite optics are also usable in the far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared ranges , where conventional glasses are too absorbent for use .",

  "/wiki/Insurance": "Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss . It is a form of risk management , primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss . An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer , insurance company , insurance carrier or underwriter . A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder . The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer 's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss . The loss may or may not be financial , but it must be reducible to financial terms , and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership , possession , or pre-existing relationship . The insured receives a contract , called the insurance policy , which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured . The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium . If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy , the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster . The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance , whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk , especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry .",

  "/wiki/Logistics": "Logistics is generally the detailed organization and implementation of a complex operation . In a general business sense , logistics is the management of the flow of things between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet requirements of customers or corporations . The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials , equipment , and supplies , as well as food and other consumable items . The logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information flow , materials handling , production , packaging , inventory , transportation , warehousing , and often security . In military science , logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply lines while disrupting those of the enemy , since an armed force without resources and transportation is defenseless . Military logistics was already practiced in the ancient world and as modern military have a significant need for logistics solutions , advanced implementations have been developed . In military logistics , logistics officers manage how and when to move resources to the places they are needed . Logistics management is the part of supply chain management and supply chain engineering that plans , implements , and controls the efficient , effective forward , and reverse flow and storage of goods , services , and related information between point of origin and point of consumption to meet customer 's requirements . The complexity of logistics can be modeled , analyzed , visualized , and optimized by dedicated simulation software . The minimization of the use of resources is a common motivation in all logistics fields . A professional working in the field of logistics management is called a logistician .",

  "/wiki/Banking": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit . Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets . Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries . Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities . In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity , banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords . Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world . In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties - notably , the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds - have played a central role over many centuries .

  "/wiki/Energy": "In physics , energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on , or to heat , the object . [ note 1 ] Energy is a conserved quantity ; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form , but not created or destroyed . The SI unit of energy is the joule , which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton . Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object , the potential energy stored by an object 's position in a force field ( gravitational , electric or magnetic ) , the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects , the chemical energy released when a fuel burns , the radiant energy carried by light , and the thermal energy due to an object 's temperature . Mass and energy are closely related . Due to mass-energy equivalence , any object that has mass when stationary ( called rest mass ) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy , and any additional energy ( of any form ) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object 's total mass just as it increases its total energy . For example , after heating an object , its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass , with a sensitive enough scale . Living organisms require energy to stay alive , such as the energy humans get from food . Human civilization requires energy to function , which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels , nuclear fuel , or renewable energy . The processes of Earth 's climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth .",
  "/wiki/Chemical": "A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition and characteristic properties . Some references add that chemical substance can not be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation methods , i.e. , without breaking chemical bonds . Chemical substances can be simple substances , chemical compounds , or alloys . Chemical elements may or may not be included in the definition , depending on expert viewpoint . Chemical substances are often called 'pure ' to set them apart from mixtures . A common example of a chemical substance is pure water ; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory . Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond ( carbon ) , gold , table salt ( sodium chloride ) and refined sugar ( sucrose ) . However , in practice , no substance is entirely pure , and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical . Chemical substances exist as solids , liquids , gases , or plasma , and may change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure . Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of chemical reactions . Forms of energy , such as light and heat , are not matter , and are thus not substances in this regard .",
  "/wiki/Fuel": "A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as heat energy or to be used for work . The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy ( via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion ) . The heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine . Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth , cooking , or industrial processes , as well as the illumination that comes with combustion . Fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration , where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy . Hydrocarbons and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans , but other substances , including radioactive metals , are also utilized . Fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy , such as those that directly release electrical energy ( such as batteries and capacitors ) or mechanical energy ( such as flywheels , springs , compressed air , or water in a reservoir ) .",

The manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution , upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies . This came through many successive rapid advances in technology , such as the development of steam power and the production of steel and coal . Following the Industrial Revolution , possibly a third of the economic output came from manufacturing industries . Many developed countries and many developing/semi-developed countries ( China , India etc . ) depend significantly on manufacturing industry .",
  "/wiki/Metals": "A metal ( from Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd m\u00e9tallon , mine , quarry , metal ) is a material that , when freshly prepared , polished , or fractured , shows a lustrous appearance , and conducts electricity and heat relatively well . Metals are typically malleable ( they can be hammered into thin sheets ) or ductile ( can be drawn into wires ) . A metal may be a chemical element such as iron ; an alloy such as stainless steel ; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride . In physics , a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero . Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures . For example , the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure . Equally , some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals . Sodium , for example , becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure . In chemistry , two elements that would otherwise qualify ( in physics ) as brittle metals - arsenic and antimony - are commonly instead recognised as metalloids , on account of their predominately non-metallic chemistry . Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals ( or are likely to be such ) . The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals , nonmetals , and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved . In astrophysics the term metal is cast more widely to refer to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two , hydrogen and helium , and not just traditional metals .",
  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock , formed as rock strata called coal seams . Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements ; chiefly hydrogen , sulfur , oxygen , and nitrogen . Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years . Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands - called coal forests - that covered much of the Earth 's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) and Permian times . As a fossil fuel burned for heat , coal supplies about a quarter of the world 's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity . Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal . The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness . The coal industry damages the environment , including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide , 14 gigatonne ( Gt ) in 2016 , which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions . As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal , and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020 . To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C ( 3.6 \u00b0F ) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 . The largest consumer and importer of coal is China . China mines almost half the world 's coal , followed by India with about a tenth .",
  "/wiki/Cement": "A cement is a binder , a substance used for construction that sets , hardens , and adheres to other materials to bind them together . Cement is seldom used on its own , but rather to bind sand and gravel ( aggregate ) together . Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry , or with sand and gravel , produces concrete . Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet 's most-consumed resource . Cements used in construction are usually inorganic , often lime or calcium silicate based , and can be characterized as either hydraulic or non-hydraulic , depending on the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water ( see hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime plaster ) . Non-hydraulic cement does not set in wet conditions or under water . Rather , it sets as it dries and reacts with carbon dioxide in the air . It is resistant to attack by chemicals after setting . Hydraulic cements ( e.g. , Portland cement ) set and become adhesive due to a chemical reaction between the dry ingredients and water . The chemical reaction results in mineral hydrates that are not very water-soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack . This allows setting in wet conditions or under water and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack . The chemical process for hydraulic cement was found by ancient Romans who used volcanic ash ( pozzolana ) with added lime ( calcium oxide ) .",
  "/wiki/Industrial_technology": "Industrial technology is the use of engineering and manufacturing technology to make production faster , simpler and more efficient . The industrial technology field employs creative and technically proficient individuals who can help a company achieve efficient and profitable productivity . Industrial technology programs typically include instruction in optimization theory , human factors , organizational behavior , industrial processes , industrial planning procedures , computer applications , and report and presentation preparation . Planning and designing manufacturing processes and equipment is a main aspect of being an industrial technologist . An Industrial technologist is often responsible for implementing certain designs and processes .",
  "/wiki/Axles": "An axle is a central shaft for a rotating wheel or gear . On wheeled vehicles , the axle may be fixed to the wheels , rotating with them , or fixed to the vehicle , with the wheels rotating around the axle . In the former case , bearings or bushings are provided at the mounting points where the axle is supported . In the latter case , a bearing or bushing sits inside a central hole in the wheel to allow the wheel or gear to rotate around the axle . Sometimes , especially on bicycles , the latter type axle is referred to as a spindle .",
  "/wiki/Wheel": "In its primitive form , a wheel is a circular block of a hard and durable material at whose center has been bored a circular hole through which is placed an axle bearing about which the wheel rotates when a moment is applied by gravity or torque to the wheel about its axis , thereby making together one of the six simple machines . When placed vertically under a load-bearing platform or case , the wheel turning on the horizontal axle makes it possible to transport heavy loads ; when placed horizontally , the wheel turning on its vertical axle makes it possible to control the spinning motion used to shape materials ( e.g . a potter 's wheel ) ; when mounted on a column connected to a rudder or a chassis mounted on other wheels , one can control the direction of a vessel or vehicle ( e.g . a ship 's wheel or steering wheel ) ; when connected to a crank or engine , a wheel can store , release , or transmit energy ( e.g . the flywheel ) .",
  "/wiki/Pumps": "A pump is a device that moves fluids ( liquids or gases ) , or sometimes slurries , by mechanical action . Pumps can be classified into three major groups according to the method they use to move the fluid : direct lift , displacement , and gravity pumps . Pumps operate by some mechanism ( typically reciprocating or rotary ) , and consume energy to perform mechanical work moving the fluid . Pumps operate via many energy sources , including manual operation , electricity , engines , or wind power , come in many sizes , from microscopic for use in medical applications to large industrial pumps . Mechanical pumps serve in a wide range of applications such as pumping water from wells , aquarium filtering , pond filtering and aeration , in the car industry for water-cooling and fuel injection , in the energy industry for pumping oil and natural gas or for operating cooling towers and other components of heating , ventilation and air conditioning systems . In the medical industry , pumps are used for biochemical processes in developing and manufacturing medicine , and as artificial replacements for body parts , in particular the artificial heart and penile prosthesis . When a casing contains only one revolving impeller , it is called a single-stage pump . When a casing contains two or more revolving impellers , it is called a double- or multi-stage pump . In biology , many different types of chemical and biomechanical pumps have evolved ; biomimicry is sometimes used in developing new types of mechanical pumps .",

  "/wiki/Supermarkets": "A supermarket is self-service shop offering a wide variety of food , beverages and household products , organized into sections . It is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores , but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market . The supermarket typically has aisles for meat , fresh produce , dairy , and baked goods . Shelf space is also reserved for canned and packaged goods and for various non-food items such as kitchenware , household cleaners , pharmacy products and pet supplies . Some supermarkets also sell other household products that are consumed regularly , such as alcohol ( where permitted ) , medicine , and clothes , and some sell a much wider range of non-food products : DVDs , sporting equipment , board games , and seasonal items ( e.g. , Christmas wrapping paper in December ) . A larger full-service supermarket combined with a department store is sometimes known as a hypermarket . Other services may include those of banks , caf\u00e9s , childcare centres/creches , insurance ( and other financial services ) , Mobile Phone services , photo processing , video rentals , pharmacies or petrol stations . If the eatery in a supermarket is substantial enough , the facility may be called a grocerant , a blend of grocery and restaurant . The traditional supermarket occupies a large amount of floor space , usually on a single level . It is usually situated near a residential area in order to be convenient to consumers . The basic appeal is the availability of a broad selection of goods under a single roof , at relatively low prices . Other advantages include ease of parking and frequently the convenience of shopping hours that extend into the evening or even 24 hours of the day .",
  "/wiki/Furniture": "Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating ( e.g. , chairs , stools , and sofas ) , eating ( tables ) , and sleeping ( e.g. , beds ) . Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work ( as horizontal surfaces above the ground , such as tables and desks ) , or to store things ( e.g. , cupboards and shelves ) . Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art . In addition to furniture 's functional role , it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose . It can be made from many materials , including metal , plastic , and wood . Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture . People have been using natural objects , such as tree stumps , rocks and moss , as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation . Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago , people began constructing and carving their own furniture , using wood , stone , and animal bones . Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia , depicting the goddess on a throne . The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland , and includes cupboards , dressers and beds all constructed from stone . Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt . This era saw constructed wooden pieces , including stools and tables , sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory .",
  "/wiki/Convenience_stores": "A convenience store , convenience shop , or corner store is a small retail business that stocks a range of everyday items such as coffee , groceries , snack foods , confectionery , soft drinks , tobacco products , over-the-counter drugs , toiletries , newspapers , and magazines . In some jurisdictions , convenience stores are licensed to sell alcohol , although many such jurisdictions limit such beverages to those with relatively low alcoholic content such as beer and wine . Such stores may also offer money order and wire transfer services , along with the use of a fax machine or photocopier for a small per-copy cost . They differ from general stores and village shops in that they are not in a rural location and are used as a convenient supplement to larger stores . A convenience store may be part of a gas/petrol station , so customers can purchase goods conveniently while filling their vehicle with fuel . It may be located alongside a busy road , in an urban area , near a railway or railroad station , or at another transport hub . In some countries , convenience stores have long shopping hours , and some remain open 24 hours . Convenience stores usually charge significantly higher prices than conventional grocery stores or supermarkets , as these stores order smaller quantities of inventory at higher per-unit prices from wholesalers . However , convenience stores make up for this loss by having longer open hours , serving more locations , and having shorter cashier lines .",
  "/wiki/Software": "Computer software , or simply software , is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work . This is in contrast to physical hardware , from which the system is built and actually performs the work . In computer science and software engineering , computer software is all information processed by computer systems , programs and data . Computer software includes computer programs , libraries and related non-executable data , such as online documentation or digital media . Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own . At the lowest programming level , [ clarification needed ] executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor - typically a central processing unit ( CPU ) or a graphics processing unit ( GPU ) . A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state . For example , an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer - an effect that is not directly observable to the user . An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations , for example displaying some text on a computer screen ; causing state changes which should be visible to the user . The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided , unless it is instructed to jump to a different instruction , or is interrupted by the operating system . As of 2015 [ update ] , most personal computers , smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together , and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past . The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages .",
  "/wiki/Server_(computing)": "In computing , a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices , called clients . This architecture is called the client-server model , and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices . Servers can provide various functionalities , often called services , such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients , or performing computation for a client . A single server can serve multiple clients , and a single client can use multiple servers . A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device . Typical servers are database servers , file servers , mail servers , print servers , web servers , game servers , and application servers . Client-server systems are today most frequently implemented by ( and often identified with ) the request-response model : a client sends a request to the server , which performs some action and sends a response back to the client , typically with a result or acknowledgement . Designating a computer as server-class hardware implies that it is specialized for running servers on it . This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than standard personal computers , but alternatively , large computing clusters may be composed of many relatively simple , replaceable server components .",
  "/wiki/Computer_hardware": "Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer , such as the case , central processing unit ( CPU ) , monitor , keyboard , computer data storage , graphics card , sound card , speakers and motherboard . By contrast , software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware . Hardware is so-termed because it is hard or rigid with respect to changes , whereas software is soft because it is easy to change . Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction . A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system , although other systems exist with only hardware .",

  "/wiki/Uranium": "Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92 . It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table . A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons , of which 6 are valence electrons . Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable ; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years . The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 ( which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth ) and uranium-235 ( which has 143 neutrons ) . Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements . Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead , and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten . It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil , rock and water , and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite . In nature , uranium is found as uranium-238 ( 99.2739-99.2752% ) , uranium-235 ( 0.7198-0.7202% ) , and a very small amount of uranium-234 ( 0.0050-0.0059% ) . Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle . The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years , making them useful in dating the age of the Earth . Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties .",
  "/wiki/Gold": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au ( from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79 , making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental ( native ) form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver ( as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ) . Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction . A relatively rare element , gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history ."
