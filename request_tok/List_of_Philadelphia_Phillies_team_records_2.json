  "/wiki/Win_(baseball)": "In baseball and softball , a pitcher 's win-loss record ( also referred to simply as their record ) indicates the number of wins ( denoted W ) and losses ( denoted L ) they have been credited with . For example , a 20-10 win-loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses . In each game , one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win ( the winning pitcher ) and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss ( the losing pitcher ) in their respective statistics . These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record . The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision , and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision . A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision . In certain situations , another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save , and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides , but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win . The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league 's rules . The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited , such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture . If the game is tied ( a rare event ) , no pitcher is awarded any decision . A pitcher 's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions ( wins plus losses ) , and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places .",

  "/wiki/John_Coleman_(outfielder/pitcher)": "John Francis Coleman ( March 6 , 1863 - May 31 , 1922 ) was an American professional baseball pitcher and outfielder . From 1883 through 1890 , Coleman played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the Philadelphia Quakers ( now the Phillies ) , the Pittsburgh Alleghenys ( now the Pirates ) , and the now-defunct Philadelphia Athletics . Remarkably , in his rookie season , he pitched in 65 games , but accumulated a record of only 12-48 ( the team 's season record was 17-81 , with its batting average of only .240 , lowest in the league ) . He appeared in another 32 games as an outfielder and second baseman . As of 2010 , his 48 losses , 772 hits given up , 510 runs allowed , and 291 earned runs allowed over that 98-game season remain single-season major-league records . These records stand out by large margins , as his nearest contenders are Will White with 42 losses and 404 runs allowed ; Ted Breitenstein with 238 earned runs ; and Bobby Mathews with 693 hits . His difference between wins and losses , 36 , is also the largest ever , dwarfing George Cobb 's 27 . His 61 games started , 59 complete games , and 538\u2153 innings pitched remain Phillies single-season records as well . After that season , Coleman played mainly as an outfielder , but occasionally filled in at first and second bases and on the pitcher 's mound . His career pitching record was 23-72 , and his career batting average was .257 . Coleman died after being hit by an automobile in Detroit It was so bad it fractured his skull according to death records Detroit , Michigan .",

  "/wiki/Strikeout": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

  "/wiki/Earned_run_average": "In baseball statistics , earned run average ( ERA ) is the average of earned runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings pitched ( i.e . the traditional length of a game ) . It is determined by dividing the number of earned runs allowed by the number of innings pitched and multiplying by nine . Runs resulting from passed balls or defensive errors ( including pitchers ' defensive errors ) are recorded as unearned runs and omitted from ERA calculations .",

  "/wiki/Earned_run": "In baseball , an earned run is any run that was fully enabled by the offensive team 's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team . Conversely , an unearned run is a run that would not have been scored without the aid of an error or a passed ball committed by the defense . An unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game . However , it is unearned in that it was , in a sense , given away by the defensive team . Both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher 's statistics . However , earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher 's earned run average ( ERA ) , the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine innings pitched ( i.e. , averaged over a regulation game ) . Thus , in effect , the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs , while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team . To determine whether a run is earned , the official scorer must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls .",
  "/wiki/Hits_allowed": "In Baseball statistics , hits allowed ( HA ) signifies the total number of hits a pitcher allowed .",
  "/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball": "In Major League Baseball , a shutout ( denoted statistically as ShO or SHO ) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run . If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act , no pitcher is awarded a shutout , although the team itself can be said to have shut out the opposing team . The ultimate single achievement among pitchers is a perfect game , which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years , most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15 , 2012 . By definition , a perfect game is counted as a shutout . A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors , base on balls , catcher 's interferences , dropped third strikes , or hit batsmen . The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson , who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907-1927 . He accumulated 110 shutouts , which is 20 more than the second place leader , Pete Alexander . The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16 , which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander ( 1916 ) and George Bradley ( 1876 ) . These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball , because pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching . Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers . The current leader among active players for career shutouts is Clayton Kershaw , who has thrown 15 .",

  "/wiki/Save_(baseball)": "In baseball , a save ( abbreviated SV or S ) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances . Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead . The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers , particularly those in the closer role . The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969 . The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date . Mariano Rivera is MLB 's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652 .",

  "/wiki/Starting_pitcher": "In baseball ( hardball or softball ) , a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team . A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent 's first batter of a game . Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game , although their ability to do this depends on many factors , including effectiveness , stamina , health , and strategy . A starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three , four , or five days after pitching a game before pitching another . Therefore , most professional baseball teams have four , five or six starting pitchers on their rosters . These pitchers , and the sequence in which they pitch , is known as the rotation . In modern baseball , a five-man rotation is most common . In contrast , a pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher . Occasionally , an opening pitcher is used for only a few innings , and is replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher .",
  "/wiki/Complete_game": "In baseball , a complete game ( denoted by CG ) is the act of a pitcher pitching an entire game without the benefit of a relief pitcher . A pitcher who meets this criterion will be credited with a complete game regardless of the number of innings played - pitchers who throw an entire official game that is shortened by rain will still be credited with a complete game , while starting pitchers who are relieved in extra innings after throwing nine or more innings will not be credited with a complete game . A starting pitcher who is replaced by a pinch hitter in the final half inning of a game will still be credited with a complete game . The frequency of complete games has evolved since the early days of baseball . The complete game was essentially an expectation in the early 20th century and pitchers completed almost all of the games they started . In modern baseball , the feat is much more rare and no pitcher has reached 30 complete games in a season since 1975 ; in the 21st century , a pitcher has thrown 10 or more complete games in a season only twice .",
  "/wiki/Inning_(baseball)": "An inning in baseball , softball , and similar games is the basic unit of play , consisting of two halves or frames , the top ( first half ) and the bottom ( second half ) . In each half , one team bats until three outs are made , with the other team playing defense . A full baseball game typically is scheduled for nine innings , while softball games consist of seven innings ; although this may be shortened due to weather or extended if the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings . Inning , in baseball and softball , is always singular , which contrasts with cricket and rounders in which the singular is innings ."
