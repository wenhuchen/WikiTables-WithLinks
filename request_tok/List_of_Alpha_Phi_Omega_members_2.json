  "/wiki/Actor": "An actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance ( also actress ; see below ) . The actor performs in the flesh in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film , radio , and television .

The actor 's interpretation of their role - the art of acting - pertains to the role played , whether based on a real person or fictional character .

  "/wiki/Comedian": "A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience by making them laugh . This might be through jokes or amusing situations , or acting foolish ( as in slapstick ) or employing prop comedy . A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comedian . A popular saying , variously quoted but generally attributed to Ed Wynn , is , A comic says funny things ; a comedian says things funny , which draws a distinction between how much of the comedy can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona . Since the 1980s , a new wave of comedy , called alternative comedy , has grown in popularity with its more offbeat and experimental style . This normally involves more experiential , or observational reporting , e.g . Alexei Sayle , Daniel Tosh and Malcolm Hardee . As far as content is concerned , comedians such as Tommy Tiernan , Des Bishop , Kevin Hart and Joan Rivers draw on their background to poke fun at themselves , while others such as Jon Stewart , and Ben Elton have very strong political and cultural undertones . Many comics achieve a cult following while touring famous comedy hubs such as the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal , the Edinburgh Fringe , and Melbourne Comedy Festival in Australia . Often a comic 's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award , such as the Edinburgh Comedy Award ( formerly the Perrier comedy award ) . Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment , such as film and television , where they become more widely known ; e.g. , Eddie Izzard or Ricky Gervais . However , a comic 's stand-up success does not guarantee a film 's critical or box office success .",

In 2005 , the British Film Institute included this film on its list of Top fifty films for children up to the age of 14 . The film was produced without approval from the Motion Picture Production Code because it plays with the idea of homosexuality and features cross-dressing .

In Australia , Australian rules football clubs and leagues use the term best and fairest , while those playing rugby league use player of the year , such as the Dally M Medal .

Their P-40B aircraft , marked with Chinese colors , flew under American control . Their mission was to bomb Japan and defend China but many delays meant the AVG flew in combat after the US and Japan declared war . The group consisted of three fighter squadrons of around 30 aircraft each that trained in Burma before the American entry into World War II to defend China against Japanese forces . The AVG were officially members of the Chinese Air Force . The group had contracts with salaries ranging from $ 250 a month for a mechanic to $ 750 for a squadron commander , roughly three times what they had been making in the U.S. forces . While it accepted some civilian volunteers for its headquarters and ground crew , the AVG recruited most of its staff from the U.S. military . The group first saw combat on 20 December 1941 , 12 days after Pearl Harbor ( local time ) . It demonstrated innovative tactical victories when the news in the U.S. was filled with little more than stories of defeat at the hands of the Japanese forces and achieved such notable success during the lowest period of the war for both the U.S. and the Allied Forces as to give hope to America that it might eventually defeat Japan . AVG pilots earned official credit and received combat bonuses for destroying 296 enemy aircraft , while losing only 14 pilots in combat . The combat records of the AVG still exist and researchers have found them credible . On 4 July 1942 the AVG was disbanded and replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces , which was later absorbed into the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force with General Chennault as commander .",
