  "/wiki/Maple_syrup": "Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple , red maple , or black maple trees , although it can also be made from other maple species . In cold climates , these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter ; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring . Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap , which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water , leaving the concentrated syrup . Most trees produce 20 to 60 litres ( 5 to 15 US gallons ) of sap per season . Maple syrup was first made and used by the indigenous peoples of North America , and the practice was adopted by European settlers , who gradually refined production methods . Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing . The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer , responsible for 70 percent of the world 's output ; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C $ 487 million ( about US $ 360 million ) , with Quebec accounting for some 90 percent of this total . Maple syrup is graded according to the Canada , United States , or Vermont scales based on its density and translucency . Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup . In Canada , syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 percent sugar . In the United States , a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as maple , though states such as Vermont and New York have more restrictive definitions . Maple syrup is often used as a condiment for pancakes , waffles , French toast , oatmeal or porridge .",
