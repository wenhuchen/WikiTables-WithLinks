  "/wiki/Aerobatics": "Aerobatics ( a portmanteau of aerial-acrobatics ) is the practice of flying maneuvers involving aircraft attitudes that are not used in normal flight . Aerobatics are performed in airplanes and gliders for training , recreation , entertainment , and sport . Additionally , some helicopters , such as the MBB Bo 105 , are capable of limited aerobatic maneuvers . An example of a fully aerobatic helicopter , capable of performing loops and rolls , is the Westland Lynx . Most aerobatic maneuvers involve rotation of the aircraft about its longitudinal ( roll ) axis or lateral ( pitch ) axis . Other maneuvers , such as a spin , displace the aircraft about its vertical ( yaw ) axis . Maneuvers are often combined to form a complete aerobatic sequence for entertainment or competition . Aerobatic flying requires a broader set of piloting skills and exposes the aircraft to greater structural stress than for normal flight . In some countries , the pilot must wear a parachute when performing aerobatics . Aerobatic training enhances a pilot 's ability to recover from unusual flight conditions , and thus is an element of many flight safety training programs for pilots .

  "/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster": "The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster was a fatal incident in the United States space program that occurred on February 1 , 2003 , when the Space Shuttle Columbia ( OV-102 ) disintegrated as it re-entered the atmosphere , killing all seven crew members . The disaster was the second fatal accident in the Space Shuttle program , after the 1986 breakup of Challenger soon after liftoff . During the launch of STS-107 , Columbia 's 28th mission , a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter . Similar foam shedding had occurred during previous shuttle launches , causing damage that ranged from minor to nearly catastrophic , but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious . Before re-entry , NASA managers had limited the investigation , reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed . When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth , the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate the heat shield and destroy the internal wing structure , which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart . After the disaster , Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years , as they had been after the Challenger disaster . Construction of the International Space Station ( ISS ) was put on hold ; the station relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State Space Corporation for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew rotation until STS-121 . NASA ultimately made several technical and organizational changes , including adding a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the shuttle 's thermal protection system had endured the ascent , and keeping a designated rescue mission ready in case irreparable damage was found . Except for one final mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope , subsequent shuttle missions were flown only to the ISS so that the crew could use it as a haven if damage to the orbiter prevented safe reentry .",

  "/wiki/Space_Shuttle": "The Space Shuttle is a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system that was operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) as part of the Space Shuttle program . Its official program name was Space Transportation System ( STS ) , taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development . The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 , leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 . In addition to the prototype whose completion was cancelled , five complete Shuttle systems were built and used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011 , launched from the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) in Florida . Operational missions launched numerous satellites , interplanetary probes , and the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ; conducted science experiments in orbit ; and participated in construction and servicing of the International Space Station . The Shuttle fleet 's total mission time was 1322 days , 19 hours , 21 minutes and 23 seconds . Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle ( OV ) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines , a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters ( SRBs ) , and the expendable external tank ( ET ) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen . The Space Shuttle was launched vertically , like a conventional rocket , with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV 's three main engines , which were fueled from the ET . The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit , and the ET was jettisoned just before orbit insertion , which used the orbiter 's two Orbital Maneuvering System ( OMS ) engines . At the conclusion of the mission , the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere . The orbiter then glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing , usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center , Florida or Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base , California . After landing at Edwards , the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft , a specially modified Boeing 747 .",

At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations . The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",

  "/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics": "Computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows . Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid , and the interaction of the fluid ( liquids and gases ) with surfaces defined by boundary conditions . With high-speed supercomputers , better solutions can be achieved , and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems . Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows . Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as wind tunnels . In addition , previously performed analytical or empirical analysis of a particular problem can be used for comparison . A final validation is often performed using full-scale testing , such as flight tests . CFD is applied to a wide range of research and engineering problems in many fields of study and industries , including aerodynamics and aerospace analysis , weather simulation , natural science and environmental engineering , industrial system design and analysis , biological engineering and fluid flows , and engine and combustion analysis ."
