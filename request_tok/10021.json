The original Atari , Inc. , founded in Sunnyvale , California in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney , was a pioneer in arcade games , home video game consoles , and home computers . The company 's products , such as Pong and the Atari 2600 , helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s . In 1984 , as a result of the video game crash of 1983 , the original Atari Inc. was split , and the arcade division was turned into Atari Games Inc. Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and brand name with appended text Games on arcade games , as well as rights to the original 1972-1984 arcade hardware properties . The Atari Consumer Electronics Division properties were in turn sold to Jack Tramiel 's Tramel Technology Ltd. , which then renamed itself to Atari Corporation . In 1996 , Atari Corporation reverse-merged with disk-drive manufacturer JT Storage ( JTS ) , becoming a division within the company . In 1998 , Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS , creating a new subsidiary , Atari Interactive . Infogrames Entertainment ( IESA ) bought Hasbro Interactive in 2001 and renamed it Infogrames Interactive , which intermittently published Atari branded titles . In 2003 , it renamed the division Atari Interactive . Another IESA division , Infogrames Inc. ( formerly GT Interactive ) , changed its name to Atari Inc. the same year , licensing the Atari name and logo from its fellow subsidiary . In 2008 , IESA completed its acquisition of Atari , Inc. 's outstanding stock , making it a wholly owned subsidiary . IESA renamed itself Atari , SA in 2009 .",

  "/wiki/Xbox_(console)": "The Xbox is a home video game console and the first installment in the Xbox series of video game consoles manufactured by Microsoft . It was released as Microsoft 's first foray into the gaming console market on November 15 , 2001 , in North America , followed by Australia , Europe and Japan in 2002 . It is classified as a sixth generation console , competing with Sony 's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo 's GameCube . It was also the first major console produced by an American company since the Atari Jaguar ceased production in 1996 . Announced in 2000 , the Xbox was graphically powerful compared to its rivals , featuring a 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor , a processor that could be found on a standard PC . It was also noted for its PC-like size and weight , and was the first console to feature a built-in hard disk . In November 2002 , Microsoft launched Xbox Live , a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection . Unlike online services from Sega and Sony , Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port . The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth-generation of consoles . The popularity of blockbuster titles such as Bungie 's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming , and in particular first-person shooters . The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America , selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001 , aided by the popularity of one of the system 's launch titles , Halo : Combat Evolved , which sold a million units by April 2002 . The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 24 million units , including 16 million in North America ; however , Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off of the console , which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price , despite its popularity , losing over $ 4 billion during its market life .",

  "/wiki/GameCube": "The Nintendo GameCube [ b ] [ c ] ( commonly abbreviated as GameCube ) is a home video game console released by Nintendo in Japan and North America in 2001 and in the PAL territories in 2002 . The sixth-generation console is the successor to the Nintendo 64 . It competed with Sony 's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft 's original Xbox . The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium . The discs are in the miniDVD format and the system was not designed to play full-sized DVDs or audio CDs , unlike its competitors , and focused on gaming instead . The console supports limited online gaming for a small number of games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable , which allows players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller . The GameCube uses composite video cables to display games on the television ; however , there are differences in the two GameCube models . The models produced before May 2004 also have the ability to use digital component AV cables and progressive scan and a second serial port . The nameplate on the top of the console with the words Nintendo GameCube can be removed . This model is known as DOL-001 . The previously mentioned features were removed in GameCube consoles produced between 2004-2007 ; the later model was known as DOL-101 . The newer model has updated firmware that disables Action Replay cheats and cheat codes ( a newer version was developed to circumvent this ) and the disc-reading laser was improved in many ways , though it is not as durable .",
  "/wiki/Wii_U": "The Wii U ( /\u02ccwi\u02d0 \u02c8ju\u02d0/ WEE YOO ) is a home video game console developed by Nintendo as the successor to the Wii . Released in late 2012 , it is the first eighth-generation video game console and competed with Microsoft 's Xbox One and Sony 's PlayStation 4 . The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to support HD graphics . The system 's primary controller is the Wii U GamePad , which features an embedded touchscreen , directional buttons , analog sticks , and action buttons . The screen can be used either as a supplement to the main display or in supported games to play the game directly on the GamePad . The Wii U Pro Controller can be used in its place as a more traditional alternative . The Wii U is backward compatible with all Wii software and accessories . Games can support any combination of the GamePad , Wii Remote , Nunchuk , Balance Board , or Nintendo 's Classic Controller or Wii U Pro Controller . Online functionality centers around the Nintendo Network platform and Miiverse , an integrated social networking service which allows users to share content in game-specific communities . The Wii U was met with a generally positive reception , which included praise for its innovative GamePad controller , improvements to online functionality over the Wii , backwards compatibility with existing Wii software and peripherals , and relative affordability . However , the Wii U was also criticized for the GamePad 's short battery life and issues with the console 's user interface and functionality . The Wii U was met with slow consumer adoption , with low sales that were primarily credited to a weak lineup of launch titles , limited third-party support , and poor marketing .",

  "/wiki/Master_System": "The Sega Master System ( SMS ) [ c ] is a third-generation 8-bit home video game console manufactured by Sega . It was originally a remodeled export version of the Sega Mark III , the third iteration of the SG-1000 series of consoles , which was released in Japan in 1985 and featured enhanced graphical capabilities over its predecessors . The Master System launched in North America in 1986 , followed by Europe in 1987 , and Brazil in 1989 . A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987 , which features a few enhancements over the export models ( and by proxy the original Mark III ) : a built-in FM audio chip , a rapid-fire switch , and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses . A cost-reduced model known as the Master System II was released in 1990 in North America and Europe . The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards . Accessories for the consoles include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with a range of specially designed games . The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot , turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system and is incompatible with the 3D glasses . The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES , due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity . Though the Master System had newer , improved hardware , it failed to overturn Nintendo 's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America . However , it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil .",

  "/wiki/TurboGrafx-16": "The TurboGrafx-16 , known in Japan and France as the PC Engine , is a cartridge-based home video game console manufactured and marketed by NEC Home Electronics , and designed by Hudson Soft . It was released in Japan on October 30 , 1987 and in the United States on August 29 , 1989 . The Japanese model was imported and distributed in France in 1989 and United Kingdom and Spain received a version based on the American model known as simply TurboGrafx . It was the first console released in the 16-bit era , although it used a modified 8-bit CPU . In Japan , the system was launched as a competitor to the Famicom but the delayed United States release meant that it ended up competing with the Sega Genesis and later on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . The TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU , a 16-bit video color encoder , and a 16-bit video display controller . The GPUs are capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously , out of 512 . With dimensions of just 14 cm \u00d7 14 cm \u00d7 3.8 cm ( 5.5 in \u00d7 5.5 in \u00d7 1.5 in ) , the Japanese PC Engine is the smallest major home game console ever made . Games were released on HuCard cartridges or later the CD-ROM optical format with the TurboGrafx-CD add-on . The TurboGrafx-16 failed to break into the North American market and sold poorly , which has been blamed on the delayed release and inferior marketing . Despite the 16 in its name and the marketing of the console as a 16-bit platform , it used an 8-bit CPU , a marketing tactic that was criticized by some as deceptive . Developer Doug Snook of ICOM Simulations said the team struggled with the relative low performance of the CPU .",

  "/wiki/Sega_Saturn": "The Sega Saturn [ a ] [ b ] is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console developed by Sega and released on November 22 , 1994 in Japan , May 11 , 1995 in North America , and July 8 , 1995 in Europe . The successor to the successful Sega Genesis , the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors . Its games are in CD-ROM format , and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games . Development of the Saturn began in 1992 , the same year Sega 's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted . The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi . Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",
  "/wiki/Dreamcast": "The Dreamcast [ a ] is a home video game console released by Sega on November 27 , 1998 in Japan , September 9 , 1999 in North America , and October 14 , 1999 in Europe . It was the first in the sixth generation of video game consoles , preceding Sony 's PlayStation 2 , Nintendo 's GameCube and Microsoft 's Xbox . The Dreamcast was Sega 's final home console , marking the end of the company 's 18 years in the console market . In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn , the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components , including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU . Released in Japan to a subdued reception , the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign , but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2 . Sales did not meet Sega 's expectations despite several price cuts , and the company continued to incur significant financial losses . After a change in leadership , Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31 , 2001 , withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher . 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide . Although the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited third-party support , reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time . Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative , including Crazy Taxi , Jet Set Radio and Shenmue , as well as high-quality ports from Sega 's NAOMI arcade system board . The Dreamcast was also the first console to include a built-in modem for internet support and online play .",
