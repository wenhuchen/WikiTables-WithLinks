  "/wiki/Hudson's_Bay_Company": "The Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ; French : Compagnie de la Baie d'Hudson ) is a Canadian retail business group . A fur trading business for much of its existence , HBC now owns and operates retail stores in Canada and the United States . The company sold most of its European operations by August 2019 and its remaining stores , in the Netherlands , were closed by the end of 2019 . HBC owns the Saks stores in the US ; most other US operations were sold by mid-2019 and the last remaining stores ( Lord & Taylor chain ) were sold prior to the end of 2019 . The company 's namesake business division is Hudson 's Bay , commonly referred to as The Bay ( La Baie in French ) . After incorporation by English royal charter in 1670 , the company functioned as the de facto government in parts of North America for nearly 200 years until the HBC sold the land it owned ( the entire Hudson Bay drainage basin , known as Rupert 's Land ) to Canada in 1869 as part of The Deed of Surrender , authorised by the Rupert 's Land Act 1868 . During its peak , the company controlled the fur trade throughout much of the English- and later British-controlled North America . By the mid-19th century , the company evolved into a mercantile business selling a wide variety of products from furs to fine homeware in a small number of sales shops ( as opposed to trading posts ) across Canada . These shops were the first step towards the department stores the company owns today . In 2008 , HBC was acquired by NRDC Equity Partners , which also owns the upmarket American department store Lord & Taylor . From 2008 to 2012 , the HBC was run through a holding company of NRDC , Hudson 's Bay Trading Company , which was dissolved in early 2012 . HBC 's head office is currently located in Brampton , Ontario .",
