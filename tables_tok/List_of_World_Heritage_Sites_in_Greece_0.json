Its principal monuments , particularly the temple of Asklepios , the Tholos and the Theatre - considered one of the purest masterpieces of Greek architecture - date from the 4th century . The vast site , with its temples and hospital buildings devoted to its healing gods , provides valuable insight into the healing cults of Greek and Roman times",

The Hellenistic theatre and funerary heroon ( temple ) were supplemented with Roman buildings such as the forum . Later the city became a centre of the Christian faith following the visit of the Apostle Paul in 49-50 CE . The remains of its basilicas constitute an exceptional testimony to the early establishment of Christianity",
