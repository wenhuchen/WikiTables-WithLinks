  "/wiki/Philmont_Scout_Ranch": "Philmont Scout Ranch is a ranch located in Colfax County , New Mexico , near the village of Cimarron ; it covers 140,177 acres ( 219 sq mi ; 567 km\u00b2 ) of wilderness in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of the Rocky Mountains . Donated by oil baron Waite Phillips , the ranch is owned and operated by the Boy Scouts of America . It is a National High Adventure Base where crews of Scouts and Venturers take part in backpacking treks and other outdoor activities . By land area , it is one of the largest youth camps in the world . During the season , between June 8 and August 22 , an estimated 22,000 Scouts and adult leaders backpack through the Ranch 's extensive backcountry . More than 1,130 seasonal staff are responsible for the Ranch 's summer operations . Philmont is also home to the Philmont Training Center , the National Scouting Museum and the Seton Memorial Library . The Training Center is the primary location for BSA 's national volunteer training programs . Philmont is a working ranch , maintaining small herds of cattle , horses , burros , and bison . The only documented Tyrannosaurus rex track in the world was discovered within the camp 's boundaries in 1993 in North Ponil Canyon by the Anasazi Trail Camp . It was formally identified in 1994 . There are three other high adventure camps that the BSA owns and maintains : the Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases in Minnesota , as well as Manitoba and Ontario in Canada , Florida National High Adventure Sea Base in the Keys , and Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in southern West Virginia .",
  "/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America_National_Council": "The Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) ( colloquially , the Boy Scouts ) is the largest scouting organization and one of the largest youth organizations in the United States , with about 2.3 million youth participants and about one million adult volunteers . The BSA was founded in 1910 , and since then , about 110 million Americans participated in BSA programs at some time in their lives . BSA is part of the international Scout Movement and became a founding member organization of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922 . The stated mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law . Youth are trained in responsible citizenship , character development , and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of outdoor activities , educational programs , and , at older age levels , career-oriented programs in partnership with community organizations . For younger members , the Scout method is part of the program to instill typical Scouting values such as trustworthiness , good citizenship , and outdoors skills , through a variety of activities such as camping , aquatics , and hiking . To further these outdoor activities , the BSA has four high-adventure bases : Northern Tier ( Minnesota , Manitoba , and Ontario ) , Philmont Scout Ranch ( New Mexico ) , Sea Base ( Florida , US Virgin Islands , and Bahamas ) , and Summit Bechtel Reserve ( West Virginia ) , as well as nearly one hundred separate camps and reservations specifically dedicated to scouts . The traditional Scouting divisions are Cub Scouting for ages 5 to 11 years , Scouts BSA for ages 11 to 18 , Venturing for ages 14 through 21 , and Sea Scouts for ages 14 through 21 . The BSA operates traditional Scouting by chartering local organizations , such as churches , clubs , civic associations , or educational organization , to implement the Scouting program for youth within their communities . Units are led entirely by volunteers appointed by the chartering organization , who are supported by local councils using both paid professional Scouters and volunteers . Additionally , Learning for Life is a non-traditional affiliate that provides in-school and career education . On February 1 , 2019 , the Boy Scouts of America renamed their flagship program , Boy Scouts , to Scouts BSA to reflect their change of policy to allow girls to join in separate , gender-specific troops .",
