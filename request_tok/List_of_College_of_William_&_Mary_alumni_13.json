  "/wiki/Virginia_in_the_American_Civil_War": "Virginia became a prominent part of the Confederacy when it joined during the American Civil War . As a Southern slave-holding state , Virginia held a state convention to deal with the secession crisis , and voted against secession on April 4 , 1861 . Opinion shifted after April 15 , when U.S. President Abraham Lincoln called for troops from all states still in the Union to put down the rebellion , following the capture of Fort Sumter , and the Virginia convention voted to declare secession from the Union . A Unionist government was established in Wheeling and the new state of West Virginia was created by an act of Congress from 50 counties of western Virginia , making it the only state to lose territory as a consequence of the war . In May , it was decided to move the Confederate capital from Montgomery , Alabama , to Richmond , Virginia , in part because the defense of Virginia 's capital was deemed vital to the Confederacy 's survival . On May 24 , 1861 , the U.S. Army moved into northern Virginia and captured Alexandria without a fight . Most of the battles in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War took place in Virginia because the Confederacy had to defend its national capital at Richmond , and public opinion in the North demanded that the Union move On to Richmond ! The successes of Robert E. Lee in defending Richmond are a central theme of the military history of the war .
