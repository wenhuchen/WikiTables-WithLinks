        "Srirangam temple is often listed as the largest functioning Hindu temple in the world ( the still larger Angkor Wat being the largest existing temple ) . The temple , located in Tamil Nadu , occupies an area of 156 acres ( 631,000 m\u00b2 ) with a perimeter of 4,116m ( 10,710 feet ) making it the largest temple in India and one of the largest religious complexes in the world . The temple is enclosed by seven concentric walls ( termed prakarams ( outer courtyard ) or mathil suvar ) with a total length of 32,592 feet or over six miles . These walls are enclosed by 21 Gopurams . The Ranganathanswamy Temple complex with 49 shrines , all dedicated to Lord Vishnu , is so huge that it is like a city within itself . However , the entire temple is not used for the religious purpose , the first three out of seven concentric walls are used by private commercial establishments such as restaurants , hotels , flower market , and residential homes . Taking this detail into account , still the temple ranks third to in the list of large Hindu temples after Thillai Nataraja Temple , Chidambaram and Tiruvannamalai Annamalaiyar Temple . The temple was awarded with UNESCO Asia Pacific Award for Cultural Heritage Conservation Program in the year 2017 for the category 'Award of Merit '",

The temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site . One wonders of how such a big temple could be built in flat 6 years taking into account the amount stone and soil to be moved and the lack of powered machinery available in those days . The massive sized main Vimanam ( Tower ) is 200 feet high , possibly the highest in the world when it was built . The Vimanam has 16 elaborately articulated stories , and dominates the main quadrangle . It has a monolithic Nandhi weighing about 25 tonnes , and is about 12 feet high and 20 feet long.The presiding deity of lingam is 12 feet tall",

Thus , the temple is also known as Birla Mandir . The famous temple is accredited to have been inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1939 . At that time , Gandhi kept a condition that the temple would not be restricted to the Hindus and people from every caste would be allowed inside . Since then , funds for further renovations and support have come from the Birla family",
