A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one .

Originally formed as the South Australian Football Association on 30 April 1877 , the SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code in Australia and one of the oldest football competitions in the world , forming just a few years after the United Hospitals Challenge Cup ( 1874 ) , the oldest rugby football competition , and over a decade before The Football League , although later than the FA Cup ( soccer ) .

The top five teams play-off in a final series culminating in the grand final for the Thomas Seymour Hill Premiership Trophy . The grand final had traditionally been held at Football Park in October , generally the week after the AFL Grand Final , though this was altered ahead of the 2014 season resulting in Adelaide Oval hosting the grand final in the penultimate weekend of September . The league owned the sub-licences for South Australia 's two AFL clubs - Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club until March 2014 , when South Australian Football Commission reached an agreement with the Adelaide and Port Adelaide football clubs - endorsed by the AFL - which will see the two AFL licences transferred to the clubs in return for payments totalling more than $ 18 million .

The VFA was formed in 1877 and is the second-oldest Australian rules football league , replacing the loose affiliation of clubs that had been the hallmark of the early years of the game . Initially serving a primarily administrative function , the VFA premiership served as the top level of club competition in Victoria until 1896 . The VFA became the secondary level of club competition from 1897 after its eight strongest clubs seceded to form the VFL . From 1897 until 1995 , the VFA remained independent from the VFL as Victoria 's secondary senior club competition . Although always much less popular than the VFL/AFL , the VFA enjoyed peaks of popularity in the 1940s with a faster-paced rival code of rules , and in the 1970s bolstered by playing on Sundays at a time when the VFL was played solely on Saturdays . Since 1995 , the league has been administered by AFL Victoria ( and its predecessors ) , and serves as one of the second-tier regional Australian semi-professional competitions which sits underneath the fully professional Australian Football League . From the 2018 season it will comprise 15 teams from throughout Victoria , nine of which have a continuous VFA heritage .

  "/wiki/Cricket": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre ( 22-yard ) pitch with a wicket at each end , each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps . The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat , while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player ( so they are out ) . Means of dismissal include being bowled , when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails , and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat , but before it hits the ground . When ten players have been dismissed , the innings ends and the teams swap roles . The game is adjudicated by two umpires , aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches . They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match 's statistical information . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs , to Test matches , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length . Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit , but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball , which is a hard , solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string . Historically , cricket 's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century . The game 's governing body is the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) , which has over 100 members , twelve of which are full members who play Test matches ."
