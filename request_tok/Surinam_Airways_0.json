As the chief sugar colony during the Dutch colonial period , it was primarily a plantation economy dependent on African slaves and , following the abolition of slavery in 1863 , indentured servants from Asia . Suriname was ruled by the Dutch-chartered company Society of Suriname between 1683 and 1795 . In 1954 , Suriname became one of the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands .
