The 74-acre ( 300,000 m2 ) preserved battlefield park encompasses the grounds over which the Newfoundland Regiment made their unsuccessful attack on 1 July 1916 during the first day of the Battle of the Somme . The Battle of the Somme was the regiment 's first major engagement , and during an assault that lasted approximately 30 minutes the regiment was all but wiped out . Purchased in 1921 by the people of Newfoundland , the memorial site is the largest battalion memorial on the Western Front , and the largest area of the Somme battlefield that has been preserved . Along with preserved trench lines , there are a number of memorials and cemeteries contained within the site . Officially opened by British Field Marshal Earl Haig in 1925 , the memorial site is one of only two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside of Canada . ( The other is the Canadian National Vimy Memorial ) . The memorial site and experience of the Newfoundland Regiment at Beaumont-Hamel has come to represent the Newfoundland First World War experience .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme": "The Battle of the Somme , also known as the Somme Offensive , was a battle of the First World War fought by the armies of the British Empire and French Third Republic against the German Empire . It took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916 on both sides of the upper reaches of the River Somme in France . The battle was intended to hasten a victory for the Allies and was the largest battle of the war 's Western Front . More than three million men fought in the battle and one million men were wounded or killed , making it one of the bloodiest battles in human history . The French and British had committed themselves to an offensive on the Somme during Allied discussions at Chantilly , Oise , in December 1915 . The Allies agreed upon a strategy of combined offensives against the Central Powers in 1916 , by the French , Russian , British and Italian armies , with the Somme offensive as the Franco-British contribution . Initial plans called for the French army to undertake the main part of the Somme offensive , supported on the northern flank by the Fourth Army of the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) . When the Imperial German Army began the Battle of Verdun on the Meuse on 21 February 1916 , French commanders diverted many of the divisions intended for the Somme and the supporting attack by the British became the principal effort . The British troops on the Somme comprised a mixture of the remains of the pre-war regular army ; the Territorial Force ; and Kitchener 's Army , a force of volunteer recruits . The first day on the Somme ( 1 July ) saw a serious defeat for the German Second Army , which was forced out of its first position by the French Sixth Army , from Foucaucourt-en-Santerre south of the Somme to Maricourt on the north bank , and by the Fourth Army from Maricourt to the vicinity of the Albert-Bapaume road . This first day was , in terms of casualties , also the worst day in the history of the British Army , which suffered 57,470 casualties , including 19,240 killed in action . These occurred mainly on the front between the Albert-Bapaume road and Gommecourt , where the attack was defeated and few British troops reached the German front line .",

The Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first time all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation , and it became a Canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice . France ceded to Canada perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge on the understanding that Canada use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial . Wartime tunnels , trenches , craters , and unexploded munitions still honeycomb the grounds of the site , which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety . Along with preserved trench lines , several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park . The project took designer Walter Seymour Allward eleven years to build . King Edward VIII unveiled it on 26 July 1936 in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun and a crowd of over 50,000 people , including 6,200 attendees from Canada . Following an extensive multi-year restoration , Queen Elizabeth II re-dedicated the monument on 9 April 2007 at a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle .

The main combatants were the four divisions of the Canadian Corps in the First Army , against three divisions of the German 6th Army . The battle took place from 9 to 12 April 1917 at the beginning of the Battle of Arras , the first attack of the Nivelle Offensive , which was intended to attract German reserves from the French , before their attempt at a decisive offensive on the Aisne and the Chemin des Dames ridge further south . The Canadian Corps was to capture the German-held high ground of Vimy Ridge , an escarpment on the northern flank of the Arras front . This would protect the First Army and the Third Army farther south from German enfilade fire . Supported by a creeping barrage , the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack . The village of Th\u00e9lus fell during the second day , as did the crest of the ridge , once the Canadian Corps overran a salient against considerable German resistance . The final objective , a fortified knoll located outside the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle , fell to the Canadians on 12 April . The 6th Army then retreated to the Oppy-M\u00e9ricourt line . Historians attribute the success of the Canadian Corps to technical and tactical innovation , meticulous planning , powerful artillery support and extensive training , as well as the inability of the 6th Army to properly apply the new German defensive doctrine . The battle was the first occasion when the four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force fought together and it was made a symbol of Canadian national achievement and sacrifice .

The battle was fought in conjunction with attacks by the French Tenth and Sixth armies on the southern flank and the Reserve/5th Army on the northern flank , against Heeresgruppe Rupprecht ( Field Marshal Rupprecht of Bavaria ) created on 28 August , from the 1st and 2nd armies of the dissolved armeegruppe Gallwitz-Somme and the 6th and 7th armies . General Ferdinand Foch , commander of groupe des arm\u00e9es du nord ( Northern Army Group ) and co-ordinator of the armies on the Somme , was unable to continue the sequential attacks by the Anglo-French armies achieved in September , because persistent rain , mist and fog grounded aircraft , turned the battlefield into a swamp and greatly increased the difficulty of transporting supplies to the front over the few roads in the area and the land that had been devastated since 1 July . The German 2nd and 1st armies on the Somme managed a recovery after the string of defeats in September , with fresh divisions to replace exhausted troops and more aircraft , artillery and ammunition diverted from the battle at Verdun and stripped from other parts of the Western Front . Command of the German Air Service ( Die Fliegertruppen ) was centralised and the new Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte ( German Air Force ) was able to challenge Anglo-French air superiority with the reinforcements and new , superior , fighter aircraft . The German flyers further reduced the ability of the Anglo-French airmen to support the armies with artillery-observation and contact patrols in the rare periods of clear weather . The German armies lost much less ground and had fewer casualties in October than in September ( the costliest month of the battle ) but the proportion of casualties increased from 78.9-82.3 per cent of the Anglo-French total . The reinforcement of the Somme front with troops and equipment from Verdun also contributed to the German defeat in the First Offensive Battle of Verdun ( 1\u00e8re Bataille Offensive de Verdun ) 20 October - 2 November ) and the loss of forts Douaumont and Vaux . Rain , fog and mud were a lesser problem for the Germans , who had to carry supplies forward over a much narrower beaten zone and were being forced back onto undamaged ground . German bombardments on the few roads between the original front line and the line established by October , increased the difficulties of the Fourth and Sixth armies and during October the size and ambition of Anglo-French attacks was reduced progressively to local operations . The soldiers of the British , French and German armies endured miserable conditions , in which the Germans were able to keep going in the knowledge that the onset of winter would end the Somme offensive , despite the many extra casualties caused by illness .

The town of Cambrai , in the d\u00e9partement of Nord , was an important supply point for the German Siegfriedstellung ( known to the British as the Hindenburg Line ) and capture of the town and the nearby Bourlon Ridge would threaten the rear of the German line to the north . Major General Henry Tudor , Commander , Royal Artillery ( CRA ) of the 9th ( Scottish ) Division , advocated the use of new artillery-infantry techniques on his sector of the front . During preparations , J. F. C. Fuller , a staff officer with the Tank Corps , looked for places to use tanks for raids . General Julian Byng , commander of the British Third Army , decided to combine both plans . [ a ] The French and British armies had used tanks in mass earlier in 1917 , although to considerably less effect . After a big British success on the first day , mechanical unreliability , German artillery and infantry defences exposed the frailties of the Mark IV tank . On the second day , only about half of the tanks were operational and British progress was limited . In the History of the Great War , the British official historian , Wilfrid Miles , and modern scholars do not place exclusive credit for the first day on tanks but discuss the concurrent evolution of artillery , infantry and tank methods . Numerous developments since 1915 matured at Cambrai , such as predicted artillery fire , sound ranging , infantry infiltration tactics , infantry-tank co-ordination and close air support . The techniques of industrial warfare continued to develop and played a vital part during the Hundred Days Offensive in 1918 , along with replacement of the Mark IV tank with improved types . The rapid reinforcement and defence of Bourlon Ridge by the Germans , as well as their subsequent counter-stroke , were also notable achievements , which gave the Germans hope that an offensive strategy could end the war before American mobilisation became overwhelming .",

The British achieved the longest advance since trench warfare had begun , surpassing the record set by the French Sixth Army on 1 July 1916 . The British advance slowed in the next few days and the German defence recovered . The battle became a costly stalemate for both sides and by the end of the battle , the British Third and First Army had suffered about 160,000 casualties and the German 6th Army about 125,000 . For much of the war , the opposing armies on the Western Front were at stalemate , with a continuous line of trenches from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border . The Allied objective from early 1915 was to break through the German defences into the open ground beyond and engage the numerically inferior German Army ( Westheer ) in a war of movement . The British attack at Arras was part of the French Nivelle Offensive , the main part of which was the Second Battle of the Aisne 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the south . The aim of the French offensive was to break through the German defences in forty-eight hours . At Arras the Canadians were to re-capture Vimy Ridge , dominating the Douai Plain to the east , advance towards Cambrai and divert German reserves from the French front .

[ a ] The battle took place on the Western Front , from July to November 1917 , for control of the ridges south and east of the Belgian city of Ypres in West Flanders , as part of a strategy decided by the Allies at conferences in November 1916 and May 1917 . Passchendaele lies on the last ridge east of Ypres , 5 mi ( 8.0 km ) from Roulers ( now Roeselare ) junction of the Bruges ( Brugge ) to Kortrijk railway . The station at Roulers was on the main supply route of the German 4th Army .

Further operations and a British supporting attack along the Belgian coast from Nieuport ( Nieuwpoort ) , combined with an amphibious landing ( Operation Hush ) , were to have reached Bruges and then the Dutch frontier . The resistance of the 4th Army , unusually wet weather in August , the beginning of the autumn rains in October and the diversion of British and French resources to Italy , enabled the Germans to avoid the general withdrawal which had seemed inevitable in early October .

  "/wiki/Hampshire": "Hampshire ( /\u02c8h\u00e6mp\u0283\u0259r/ , /-\u0283\u026a\u0259r/ ( listen ) ; postal abbreviation Hants . ) [ note 1 ] is a county in southern England . The county town is the city of Winchester . Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest . Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars . The Isle of Wight , historically part of Hampshire , became a separate ceremonial county in 1974 .",
