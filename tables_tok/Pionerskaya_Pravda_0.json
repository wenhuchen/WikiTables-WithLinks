Initially it was an all-Union newspaper of the Soviet Union. Its name may be translated as Truth for Young Pioneers. The newspaper was founded March 6, 1925 in Moscow. In the 1970s and 1980s its circulation approached 10,000,000 (almost every child in the Soviet Union had a subscription). Its title followed the name of the main Soviet newspaper of the time, Pravda, as did multiple other newspapers. The newspaper continues to exist today, but now it is not associated with Young Pioneers, and the circulation is greatly reduced. Similar newspapers were published in other languages of the USSR: as of 1974, six newspapers in Russian and 22 in other languages."
