Many athletes , among them some who won events , did n't know that they had competed in the Olympic Games . Women took part in the games for the first time , and sailor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Pourtal\u00e8s , born Helen Barbey in New York City , became the first female Olympic champion . The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes , who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest . At the Sorbonne conference of 1894 , Pierre de Coubertin proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in 1900 in Paris . The delegates to the conference were unwilling to wait six years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896 . A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and that Paris would host the second celebration . Most of the winners in 1900 did not receive medals , but were given cups or trophies .",

  "/wiki/Football_at_the_1920_Summer_Olympics": "Football was one of the 154 events at the 1920 Summer Olympics , held in Antwerp , Belgium . It was the fifth time association football was on the Olympic schedule . The tournament was expanded to 14 countries , including a non-European nation ( Egypt ) by the first time . At the first Olympics after World War I , countries involved in the conflict ( Germany , Austria , Hungary , and their allies Bulgaria and Turkey ) were not invited . The English FA had withdrawn from FIFA ( together with the junior partners from Scotland , Ireland and Wales ) after their demand that the federations of Germany , Austria and Hungary be excluded had been rejected . FIFA nevertheless accepted the entry of a Great Britain football team , judging that countries entering the Olympic Games in other sports should not be hindered entering the football tournament . However , the gold medalists of the previous two Olympic football tournaments would not enjoy their participation long , as they were defeated 1-3 in the first round by Norway , who thus celebrated one of their iconic victories ( to be followed by the elimination of Nazi Germany at the 1936 Berlin Olympics , the 1993 win over England in World Cup qualifying , and the 2-1 defeat of reigning world champions Brazil at the 1998 World Cup ) . The final ( and gold ) was won by host Belgium against Czechoslovakia ( which participated in an international competition for the first time in their history ) after the Czechs walked off to protest the officiating , and were subsequently disqualified from the tournament . A play-off was necessary to determine the silver medallists . France refused to play because most of their players had returned home . So Italy , Norway , Spain and Sweden played off for the right to meet the Netherlands for second place . Finally Spain won the silver medal , while the Netherlands won the bronze medal ."
