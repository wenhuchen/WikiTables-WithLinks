        "The Military Frontier was a borderland of the Habsburg Monarchy and later the Austrian and Austro-Hungarian Empire . It acted as the cordon sanitaire against incursions from the Ottoman Empire . The inhabitants of the area were known as the Grenzer , or 'Frontiersmen ' . They were colonists , mostly ethnic Serbs , Croats and Germans , who undertook to defend the Monarchy in return for their land-grants . Germans had been recruited by Hungary in the late 18th century to resettle and develop the Danube River Valley , and became known as Donauschwaben . The military regiments formed by the settlers had a vested reason to stand and fight and were familiar with local terrain and conditions . They soon gained a formidable military reputation",

It was abolished and returned to the Ottoman Empire in 1739 . During this Habsburg rule , Serbian majority did benefit from self-government , including an autonomous militia , and economic integration with the Habsburg monarchy - reforms that contributed to the growth of the Serb middle class and continued by the Ottomans in the interest of law and order",
