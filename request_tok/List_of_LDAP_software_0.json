  "/wiki/GPL_linking_exception": "A GPL linking exception modifies the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) in a way that enables software projects which provide library code to be linked to the programs that use them , without applying the full terms of the GPL to the using program . Linking is the technical process of connecting code in a library to the using code , to produce a single executable file . It is performed either at compile time or run-time in order to produce functional machine-readable code . There is a public perception , so far unsupported by any legal precedent or citation , that without applying the linking exception , a program linked to GPL library code may only be distributed under a GPL-compatible license . [ irrelevant citation ] The license of the GNU Classpath project explicitly includes a statement to that effect . Many free software libraries which are distributed under the GPL use an equivalent exception , although the wording of the exception varies . Notable projects include ERIKA Enterprise , GNU Guile , the run-time libraries of GNAT , GNU Classpath and the famous GCC Runtime Library Exception . Compiler runtime libraries also often use this license modification or an equivalent one , e.g . the libgcc library in the GNU Compiler Collection , as well as all libraries of the Free Pascal project . In 2007 , Sun Microsystems released most of the source code to the class libraries for the Java SE and Java EE projects under version 2 of the GPL license plus the Classpath linking exception , and used the same license as one possible license for their enterprise server GlassFish and for their NetBeans Java IDE . Version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is likewise constructed as an exception to the GPL .",

It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services . Initially , Active Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management . Starting with Windows Server 2008 , however , Active Directory became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services . A server running Active Directory Domain Service ( AD DS ) is called a domain controller . It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network - assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software . For example , when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows domain , Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or normal user . Also , it allows management and storage of information , provides authentication and authorization mechanisms , and establishes a framework to deploy other related services : Certificate Services , Active Directory Federation Services , Lightweight Directory Services , and Rights Management Services . Active Directory uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol",

  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",
  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs .
