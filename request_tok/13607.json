  "/wiki/Miss_Great_Britain": "Following World War Two , a number of seaside resorts around the country introduced beauty contests as attractions , which immediately evolved into the national competition , Miss Great Britain . The contest began in the Summer of 1945 under the name Bathing Beauty Queen , organised by the Morecambe Local Council in partnership with the Sunday Dispatch newspaper . Morecambe went on to become the home of Miss Great Britain between 1956 and 1989 . The first ever Miss Great Britain final was watched by 4,300 people in a continuous downpour . The winner received a cup and according to the local newspaper a paltry prize of seven guineas as well as a swimsuit . Prize money increased to \u00a3100 the following year , \u00a3500 the next and reached \u00a31000 in the fifties due to its popularity . The contest continued to offer the largest prize fund of any competition run by a municipal authority . The sixties saw the beginning of the decline in British seaside holidays with families increasingly able to afford trips abroad . A new competition format was needed and was realised with the introduction of television to Miss Great Britain in 1971 . By 1978 , the prize fund had increased to \u00a310,000 thanks to the competitions sponsors , and the popularity of the competition was again on the rise . The contests were aimed at a family audience - men could enjoy watching pretty girls , women could have fun backing their favourites and young girls could aspire to be a bathing beauty when they grew up . For the girls who entered , there was the lure of cash prizes , and potential fame and fortune .",
