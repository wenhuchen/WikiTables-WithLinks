The off-season began in late June with the 2007 NHL Entry Draft in Columbus , Ohio . The Rangers had the 17th overall pick in the first round , yet came away with a steal as Russian superstar Alexei Cherepanov fell for the taking , despite being considered by many rankings to be a top five prospect , and the top European available in the draft . A variety of reasons have been postulated for Cherepanov 's drop , most notably , the lack of a new transfer agreement between the National Hockey League and the International Ice Hockey Federation concerning players from Russia . In the second round , the Rangers selected goaltender Antoine Lafleur from the P.E.I . Rocket of the QMJHL . Lafleur was ranked # 3 among North American goaltenders by NHL Central Scouting . The Rangers made a tremendous splash on July 1 , the first day of free agency . Within a 30-minute span on that Sunday evening , the Rangers announced the signings of the two most coveted centers available : Scott Gomez from the rival New Jersey Devils and Chris Drury from the Buffalo Sabres . As both players had worn number 23 with their previous teams , General Manager Glen Sather flipped a puck at their introductory press conference to determine who would wear number 23 on the Rangers ; the winner was Drury . After these signings , left out of the picture was center Michael Nylander , who had reportedly signed with the Edmonton Oilers , but then actually signed with the Washington Capitals .",
