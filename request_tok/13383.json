  "/wiki/Edward_Ferrars": "Edward Ferrars is a fictional character in Jane Austen 's Sense and Sensibility . He is the elder of Fanny Dashwood 's two brothers and forms an attachment to Elinor Dashwood . As first described in Sense and Sensibility : Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address . He was not handsome , and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing . He was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart . His understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement . But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished - as - they hardly knew what . His personality , while it lacks the flash of Marianne Dashwood 's romantic interest Willoughby , indicates more fortitude . Despite the good common sense that links him to Elinor , he is able to attach himself to other people and form bonds of friendship and love with ease . He exemplifies great loyalty when he sacrifices his potential happiness with Elinor to honor a promise he made to another girl when he was younger . He and Marianne 's future husband Colonel Brandon are both models of great character under unimpressive exteriors . This simplicity makes them rather less three-dimensional than Pride and Prejudice 's Fitzwilliam Darcy and Emma 's Mr. Knightley .",
  "/wiki/The_Turn_of_the_Screw_(2009_film)": "The Turn of the Screw ( also known as Ghost Story : The Turn of the Screw ) is a British television film based on Henry James 's 1898 ghost story of the same name . Commissioned and produced by the BBC , it was first broadcast on 30 December 2009 , on BBC One . The novella was adapted for the screen by Sandy Welch , and the film was directed by Tim Fywell . Although generally true to the tone and story of James 's work , the film is set in the 1920s - in contrast to the original 1840s setting - and accentuates sexual elements that some theorists have identified in the novella . The film 's story is told in flashbacks during consultations between the institutionalised Ann ( Michelle Dockery ) and Dr Fisher ( Dan Stevens ) . Ann tells how she was hired by an aristocrat ( Mark Umbers ) to care for the orphans Miles ( Josef Lindsay ) and Flora ( Eva Sayer ) . She is met at the children 's home , Bly , by Mrs Grose ( Sue Johnston ) , the housekeeper . Ann soon begins to see unknown figures around the manor , and seeks an explanation . Critics were divided in their reviews of The Turn of the Screw . The acting and tone of the production were generally praised , but the plot 's divergences from the original story were less well received . A particular disagreement concerned the film 's horrific elements ; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary , while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective . The original story has been much analysed owing to its ambiguity , and critics disagreed about the extent to which the film succeeded in portraying this trait .",
