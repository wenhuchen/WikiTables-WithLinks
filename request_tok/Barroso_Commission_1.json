  "/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union": "The European Union ( EU ) consists of 27 member states . Each member state is party to the founding treaties of the union and thereby shares in the privileges and obligations of membership . Unlike members of most international organisations , the member states of the EU have agreed by treaty to shared sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in some ( but by no means all ) aspects of government . Member states must agree unanimously for the EU to adopt some policies ; for others , collective decision making is by qualified majority voting . Subsidiarity , meaning that decisions are taking collectively if and only if they can not realistically be taken individually , is a founding principle of the EU . In 1957 , six core states founded the EU 's predecessor , the European Economic Community ( Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , and West Germany ) . The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements . To accede , a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria , which require a candidate to have a democratic , free-market government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions , and respect for the rule of law . Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate 's adoption of the existing body of EU law , known as the acquis communautaire . Until 2020 , no member state had withdrawn or been suspended from the EU , though some dependent territories or semi-autonomous areas had previously left . The UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on 29 March 2017 to formally initiate the Brexit process . Completion occurred on 31 January 2020 ( London time ) , with all other arrangements remaining in place during a transition period while a free trade agreement is negotiated .",

In the 1920s , the party emerged as the main rival to the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) , and the party 's first prime minister , Ky\u00f6sti Kallio , held the office four times between 1922 and 1937 . After World War II , the party settled as one of the four major political parties in Finland , alongside the National Coalition Party , the Social Democrats , and , until the 1980s , the Communist SKDL . Urho Kekkonen served as President of Finland from 1956 to 1982 : by far the longest period of any president . The name 'Centre Party ' was adopted in 1965 , and 'Centre of Finland ' in 1988 . The Centre Party was the largest party in Parliament from 2003 to 2011 , during which time Matti Vanhanen was prime minister for seven years . Following the 2011 election , the party was reduced in parliamentary representation from the largest party to the fourth largest , but in 2015 it reclaimed its status as the largest party . In 2019 , it suffered a considerable defeat , losing 18 of 49 seats . As a Nordic agrarian party , the Centre Party 's political influence is greatest in small and rural municipalities , where it often holds a majority of the seats in the municipal councils .

The party was created in 1992 from the former Party for Freedom and Progress ( PVV ) and politicians from other parties . The party led the government for three cabinets under Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 until March 2008 . Open VLD most recently formed the Federal Government ( the so-called Swedish government ) with N-VA , CD & V and the Francophone Reformist Movement ( MR ) . In the Flemish Parliament , the VLD formed a coalition government with sp.a-Spirit and Christian Democratic and Flemish ( CD & V ) from after the 2004 regional election until the 2009 regional election . Open VLD has been a member of the Leterme I Government formed on 22 March 2008 , the Van Rompuy I Government formed on 2 January 2009 , the Leterme II Government formed on 24 November 2009 and the Di Rupo Government formed on 6 December 2011 . Ideologically , Open VLD started as an economically liberal , somewhat Thatcherite party under its founder , Guy Verhofstadt . The VLD rapidly became more centrist and gave up much of its free market approach , partly under the influence of Verhofstadt 's political scientist brother Dirk Verhofstadt . Party chairman Bart Somers called in November 2006 for a revolution within the party , saying that a liberal party , like the VLD , can be only progressive and social . From 2000 to 2004 , during the second period of its participation in the Belgian federal government and under Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt , the VLD allegedly lost most of its ideological appeal . Several of its thinkers such as ( former member ) Boudewijn Bouckaert , president of Nova Civitas , heavily criticised the party . Many others resented the priority it placed on the 'Belgian compromise ' , which enabled the French Community 's Socialist Party to gain a dominant position in the formulation of Belgian federal government policy .",
