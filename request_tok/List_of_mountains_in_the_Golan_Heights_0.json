In 2013 , Modern Hebrew was spoken by over nine million people worldwide . Historically , it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors , although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh itself . [ note 1 ] The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE . Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family . Hebrew is the only Canaanite language still spoken , and the only truly successful example of a revived dead language . Hebrew had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE , declining since the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt . [ note 2 ] Aramaic and , to a lesser extent , Greek were already in use as international languages , especially among elites and immigrants . Hebrew survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy , rabbinic literature , intra-Jewish commerce and poetry . With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century , it was revived as a spoken and literary language , becoming the main language of the Yishuv , and subsequently of the State of Israel . According to Ethnologue , in 1998 , Hebrew was the language of five million people worldwide . After Israel , the United States has the second-largest Hebrew-speaking population , with about 220,000 fluent speakers , mostly from Israel .",
  "/wiki/Volcano": "A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object , such as Earth , that allows hot lava , volcanic ash , and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface . Earth 's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major , rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter , softer layer in its mantle . Therefore , on Earth , volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging , and most are found underwater . For example , a mid-oceanic ridge , such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates . Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust 's plates , e.g. , in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America . This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of plate hypothesis volcanism . Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes . These so-called hotspots , for example Hawaii , are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core-mantle boundary , 3,000 km deep in the Earth . Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another .",

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic . This distinction exists primarily among Western linguists ; Arabic speakers themselves generally do not distinguish between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic , but rather refer to both as al-\u02bfarabiyyatu l-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 , the purest Arabic ) or simply al-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 ) . Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet . The Balkan languages , including Greek and Bulgarian , have also acquired a significant number of Arabic words through contact with Ottoman Turkish .",

It is situated in a high valley in the Golan Heights at 1,010 metres ( 3,313 feet ) above sea level . Since 1974 , pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 350 and the Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria , the city is inside the UN-patrolled buffer zone . Quneitra was founded in the Ottoman era as a way station on the caravan route to Damascus and subsequently became a garrison town of some 20,000 people . In 1946 , it became part of the independent Syrian Republic within the Riff Dimashq Governorate and in 1964 became the capital of the split Quneitra Governorate . On 10 June 1967 , the last day of the Six-Day War , Quneitra came under Israeli control . It was briefly recaptured by Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur War , but Israel regained control in its subsequent counter-offensive . The city was almost completely destroyed before the Israeli withdrawal in June 1974 . Syria had refused to rebuild the city and actively discouraged resettlement in the area . Israel was heavily criticized by the United Nations for the city 's destruction , while Israel has also criticized Syria for not rebuilding Quneitra . During the Syrian Civil War , Quneitra became a clash point between rebel forces and Syrian Arab Army . As of 2014 [ update ] , it became controlled by the Syrian opposition ."
