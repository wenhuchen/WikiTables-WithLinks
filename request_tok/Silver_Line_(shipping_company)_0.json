  "/wiki/Rutile": "Rutile is a mineral composed primarily of titanium dioxide ( TiO2 ) , and is the most common natural form of TiO2 . Other rarer polymorphs of TiO2 are known including anatase , akaogiite , and brookite . Rutile has one of the highest refractive indices at visible wavelengths of any known crystal and also exhibits a particularly large birefringence and high dispersion . Owing to these properties , it is useful for the manufacture of certain optical elements , especially polarization optics , for longer visible and infrared wavelengths up to about 4.5 \u03bcm . Natural rutile may contain up to 10% iron and significant amounts of niobium and tantalum .
