  "/wiki/Microblading": "Microblading is a tattooing technique in which a small handheld tool made of several tiny needles is used to add semi-permanent pigment to the skin . Microblading differs from standard eyebrow tattooing because each hairstroke is created by hand using a blade which creates fine slices in the skin , whereas eyebrow tattoos are done with a machine and single needle . Microblading is typically used on eyebrows to create , enhance or reshape their appearance in terms of both shape and color . It deposits pigment into the upper region of the dermis , so it fades more rapidly than traditional tattooing techniques , which deposit pigment deeper . Microblading artists are not necessarily tattoo artists , and vice versa , because the techniques require different training . Microblading is also sometimes called embroidery , feather touch or hair-like strokes ."
