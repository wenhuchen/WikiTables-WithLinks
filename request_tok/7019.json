The squad of 16 women , all from Zimbabwe 's white minority , was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led Olympic boycott created in the women 's hockey competition . Zimbabwe 's subsequent victory in the round-robin tournament with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge upset , particularly considering the team 's lack of preparation and experience ; it has been called an irresistible fairy story . Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe , the gold medal was the country 's first Olympic medal of any colour . The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women 's hockey , and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name - barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons , the country had last competed as Rhodesia in 1964 . The women 's hockey matches , held between 25 and 31 July , were all played on artificial turf , which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen ; they had also never played together until that month . After beating Poland and the USSR and drawing with Czechoslovakia and India , the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4-1 victory over Austria . Dubbed the Golden Girls by the media of Zimbabwe , they were met by cheering crowds on their return home , and were briefly national celebrities . Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004 .",
