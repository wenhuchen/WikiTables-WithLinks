  "/wiki/Elevation": "The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point , most commonly a reference geoid , a mathematical model of the Earth 's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface ( see Geodetic datum \u00a7 Vertical datum ) . The term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth 's surface , while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface , such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit , and depth is used for points below the surface . Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth . Due to the equatorial bulge , the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have , respectively , the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance .",

As of the 2010 Census , the population was 73,007 , making Canton eighth among Ohio cities in population . Founded in 1805 alongside the Middle and West Branches of Nimishillen Creek , Canton became a heavy manufacturing center because of its numerous railroad lines . However , its status in that regard began to decline during the late 20th century , as shifts in the manufacturing industry led to the relocation or downsizing of many factories and workers . After this decline , the city 's industry diversified into the service economy , including retailing , education , finance and healthcare . Canton is chiefly notable for being the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the birthplace of the National Football League . 25th U.S. President William McKinley conducted the famed front porch campaign , which won him the presidency of the United States in the 1896 election , from his home in Canton .

  "/wiki/Canton_Museum_of_Art": "The Canton Museum of Art , founded in 1935 , is a broad-based community arts organization designed to encourage and promote the fine arts in Canton , Ohio . In its early days ( 1935-1945 ) , the Museum served largely as an exhibition and meeting place for local artists ; collecting was not a prime objective . A program from 1943 lists the museums eight objectives , with the Permanent Collection mentioned last : To provide a permanent museum for the collecting and preservation of art objects . Operating under this broad mandate , the Museum began to purchase work of local and regional artists . Many of these works were of Canton area landmarks or personalities documenting the cultural and historic heritage of the area . Gifts from local patrons and corporate benefactors from their personal art collections are also included in the Museum 's holdings . Many of these donors were themselves artists or sponsors of area artists . The Museum collection added to the local cultural heritage in two major ways - public exposure to the larger world of art and documentation of local art history . The purchases of works by local artists and the acceptance of donations were the two major influences on the development of the Permanent Collection until the Museum moved into the Cultural Center for the Arts in 1970 . At that time , the Museums Board decided that the Permanent Collection should be focused on a more specific collecting area . The Ralph L. Wilson Collection of American Art , gifted in the 1970s , was a significant step toward the eventual focus on 19th and 20th Century American artists .",
