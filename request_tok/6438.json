  "/wiki/Yamaha_YZF-R7": "The Yamaha YZF-R7 or OW-02 is a race homologation motorcycle made by Yamaha in limited production run of only 500 units . It was designed to compete in the Superbike World Championship and Suzuka 8 Hours endurance races . It has a 749 cc ( 45.7 cu in ) , DOHC 20-valve ( 5 valves per cylinder ) inline-four engine producing 106 hp ( 79.0 kW ) on the base model for 32k US Dollars . But Yamaha also produced two race kits for the R7 the first for 914.25 US Dollars made 135 hp ( 100.7 kW ) when the other , unused bank of fuel injectors is activated and a pipe and ECU update . The second race kit for 12,190.00 US Dollars unleashed 162 hp ( 120.8 kW ) . The R7 was built for racing 'out of the box ' , implied by the chassis , which was derived from information and geometry from the YZR500 machines of the period . The R7 was specified with \u00d6hlins suspension components and with titanium valves , titanium conrods , a shortened Deltabox II frame and dry weight of just 189 kg ( 416 lb ) . The intentions of the R7 were further underlined , with its designation of OW-02 and the lack of any pillion/passenger provision . The ECU came pre-programmed with racing maps for fuel and ignition , which were unlocked when the ECU detected that the race kit 's wiring harness had been installed . Super Streetbikes magazine ranked the R7 eighth in its list , The 10 Most Exotic Bikes Ever , noting its extraordinary $ 32,000 price and top-spec \u00d6hlins race suspension and running gear and that the bike , looked utterly amazing : genuine two-wheeled sex , but said it was ironic that in spite of being the most exotic R-series bike ever , it actually turned out to be a bit of a lemon . The problem was that the bike as sold was hobbled , at only 100 hp , and that small teams could not afford the thousands of dollars of racing upgrades necessary to make the R7 competitive , and when they did , the crankshafts failed . For the sake of simplicity and cost savings , Yamaha had chosen to detune the engines for bikes imported into all countries to meet the German market 's maximum horsepower regulation , partially because whatever level it was detuned to was irrelevant , given that virtually every buyer intended to modify the bike from street-legal form in order to race .",
