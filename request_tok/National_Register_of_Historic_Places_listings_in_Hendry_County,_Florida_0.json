  "/wiki/Florida_State_Road_832": "In the mid-1970s , the Florida Department of Transportation ( formerly the State Road Department ) started a sequence of events that eventually resulted in the transferral of hundred of miles of roadway from State of Florida maintenance to county control . The first step was the addition of an S- or C- prefix onto the original FDOT designation ( S represented secondary ; C represented county ) . State Road signs started disappearing from the C roads and were replaced by Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices ( MUTCD ) compliant county road signs in the early 1980s ; the transition of S roads to county control took a bit longer . Many roads that were decommissioned in later years skipped the prefix step . While the transition occurred throughout the State of Florida , the area most dramatically affected by this process was Florida south of State Road 70 ( SR 70 ) ( which runs from Bradenton to Fort Pierce ) .
