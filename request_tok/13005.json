  "/wiki/Calderwood_Dam": "Calderwood Dam is a hydroelectric dam located along the Little Tennessee River in Blount and Monroe counties , in the U. S. state of Tennessee . Completed in 1930 , the dam is owned and maintained by Tapoco , a subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of America ( Alcoa ) , although the Tennessee Valley Authority controls the dam 's reservoir levels from Fontana Dam further upstream . Calderwood Dam is named for Alcoa engineer Isaac Glidden Calderwood ( 1871-1941 ) , who supervised much of the company 's early Little Tennessee River operations . Calderwood Dam was one of four dams - along with Cheoah , Santeetlah , and Chilhowee - built in the Little Tennessee Valley by Alcoa in the 20th century to provide electricity to its aluminum smelting operations in Blount County . The dam was one of the last to be completed in the Tennessee River watershed before TVA took control of the watershed in 1933 . Alcoa developed the community of Calderwood , Tennessee , just downstream from the dam to house construction and maintenance crews for its Little Tennessee Valley operations . In 1989 , Calderwood Dam was placed on the National Register of Historic Places . The listing was expanded in 1990 and again in 2004 to include most of the dam 's substructures .",
  "/wiki/Tennessee_River": "The Tennessee River is the largest tributary of the Ohio River . It is approximately 652 miles ( 1,049 km ) long and is located in the southeastern United States in the Tennessee Valley .

Its current name is derived from the Cherokee village Tanasi .",
  "/wiki/Calderwood,_Tennessee": "Calderwood was a community once located along the Little Tennessee River in Blount County , Tennessee , United States . Established in 1912 as a base for the Aluminum Company of America 's Little Tennessee Valley hydroelectric development operations , the community continued to house construction personnel and dam maintenance personnel for nearby Calderwood Dam until the 1960s . Although the community 's houses were razed after its abandonment , three buildings located in the community - the Calderwood Dam service building , the Calderwood School , and a Quonset hut used as a theater - were included in a supplementary listing for Calderwood Dam on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 . Alcoa began developing the Little Tennessee Valley in 1909 to provide the ample amounts of electricity necessary to power its planned aluminum smelting operations in Blount County . Under the leadership of Alcoa engineer Isaac Glidden Calderwood ( 1871-1941 ) , three dams - Cheoah ( 1919 ) , Santeetlah ( 1928 ) , and Calderwood ( 1930 ) - were completed in a remote section of the valley along the Tennessee-North Carolina border . The community of Calderwood was initially known as Alcoa , but was renamed in I. G. Calderwood 's honor after the company reapplied the name Alcoa to its main company town in northern Blount County .",

  "/wiki/Chota_(Cherokee_town)": "Chota ( also spelled Chote , Echota , Itsati , and other similar variations ) is a historic Overhill Cherokee town site in Monroe County , Tennessee , in the southeastern United States . Developing after nearby Tanasi , from the late 1740s until 1788 Chota was the most important of the Overhill towns , replacing Tanasi as the de facto capital of the Cherokee people . A number of prominent Cherokee leaders were born or resided at Chota , among them Attakullakulla , Oconostota , Old Hop , Old Tassel , Hanging Maw , and Nancy Ward . The former Chota and Tanasi sites are listed together on the National Register of Historic Places ; Tanasi also has an archaeological site designation ( 40MR62 ) assigned in 1972 . Since 1979 , both sites have been mostly submerged by the Tellico Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River . Archeological excavations were conducted before the dam was completed . The Chota townhouse site was found during the excavations . This area was raised above the reservoir 's operating levels and connected via a causeway to the mainland . The Chota monument , situated directly above the ancient townhouse site , consists of eight pillars - one for each of the seven Cherokee clans , and one for the nation . The grave of Chief Oconostota , uncovered in the 1969 excavations , was re-interred next to the monument . This site is now managed by the Eastern Band of the Cherokee .",
  "/wiki/Tanasi": "Tanasi ( Cherokee : \u13d4\u13be\u13cf , romanized : Tanasi ) ( also spelled Tanase , Tenasi , Tenassee , Tunissee , Tennessee , and other such variations ) was a historic Overhill Cherokee village site in present-day Monroe County , Tennessee , in the southeastern United States . The village was the namesake for the state of Tennessee . Abandoned by the Cherokee in the 19th century , since 1979 the town site has been submerged by the Tellico Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River . Tanasi served as the de facto capital of the Cherokee from as early as 1721 until 1730 , when the capital shifted to Great Tellico . The Cherokee town of Chota developed immediately north of and later than Tanasi ( the two sites were divided by an unnamed stream ) ; by the Chota 1740s had become the more prominent of the two towns , holding the townhouse where chiefs would meet with colonial emissaries . Although Chota and Tanasi had distinct political , social , and demographic traits , excavators in the late 1960s determined that the two towns are archaeologically indistinguishable . They were among what were called the Overhill Towns by English colonists , who traveled over the Appalachian Mountains from the east to reach them . The two towns are grouped as a single listing on the National Register of Historic Places , although Tanasi was given its own site designation ( 40MR62 ) in 1972 . In the 1980s , the Tennessee Valley Authority placed a monument on the shoreline above the submerged site of Tanasi that commemorates its history and its legacy as the origin of the name Tennessee . This monument is approximately 7 miles ( 11 km ) southeast of Vonore , just off Highway 455 ( Citico Road ) . The site is managed by the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation .",

  "/wiki/Fort_Loudoun_(Tennessee)": "Fort Loudoun was a British colonial-era fort located in what is now Monroe County , Tennessee , United States . Built in 1756 and 1757 to help garner Cherokee support for the British at the outset of the Seven Years ' War , the fort was one of the first significant British outposts west of the Appalachian Mountains . The fort was designed by John William G. De Brahm , its construction was supervised by Captain Raymond Demer\u00e9 , and its garrison was commanded by Demer\u00e9 's brother , Paul Demer\u00e9 . It was named for the Earl of Loudoun , the commander of British forces in North America at the time . Relations between the garrison of Fort Loudoun and the local Cherokee inhabitants were initially cordial , but soured in 1758 due to hostilities between Cherokee fighters and European settlers in Virginia and South Carolina . After the massacre of several Cherokee chiefs who were being held hostage at Fort Prince George , the Cherokee laid siege to Fort Loudoun in March 1760 . The fort 's garrison held out for several months , but diminishing supplies forced its surrender in August 1760 . Hostile Cherokees attacked the fort 's garrison as it marched back to South Carolina , killing more than two dozen and taking most of the survivors prisoner . The fall of Fort Loudoun led to an invasion of Cherokee territory by General James Grant and an important peace expedition to the Overhill country by Henry Timberlake . The fort was reconstructed in the 20th century based on the detailed descriptions of its design by De Brahm and Demer\u00e9 , and excavations conducted by the Works Progress Administration , the Fort Loudoun Association , and the Tennessee Division of Archaeology . It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 , and is now the focus of Fort Loudoun State Park .",

Analysis of the site 's Woodland period ( 1000 BC - 1000 AD ) artifacts shows evidence of an extensive trade network that reached to indigenous peoples in Georgia , North Carolina , and Ohio . This was later an area of known Cherokee settlements , the historic people encountered by Anglo-European settlers in the 18th and 19th centuries . Since 1979 , the Icehouse Bottom site has been submerged by Tellico Lake , an impoundment of the Little Tennessee River created by the construction of Tellico Dam .
