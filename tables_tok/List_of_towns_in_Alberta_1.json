  "section_title": "New towns",
  "section_text": "New town is a former urban municipal status in Alberta that is no longer in use . The authority to incorporate a community as a new town came from The New Towns Act , which was chapter 39 of the Statutes of Alberta , 1956 . At least 12 communities incorporated as a new town between 1956 and 1967 . Cynthia and Drayton Valley were the first communities in Alberta to incorporate as new towns on June 1 , 1956 . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Drayton Valley did so after only six months of incorporation as a village , [ 22 ] and was also the community that operated under new town status for the shortest period \u2013 eight months from June 1 , 1956 to February 1 , 1957 . [ 23 ] The last community to incorporate as a new town was Fox Creek on July 19 , 1967 . [ 24 ] Fox Creek was previously unincorporated prior to this date . It remained a new town for just over sixteen years until September 1 , 1983 when it changed to town status . [ 25 ] Rainbow Lake was the last community to be recognized as a new town . Its status was changed to that of a town in 1994 when numerous former acts under the authority of Alberta Municipal Affairs were transitioned into the current Municipal Government Act . [ 26 ] Rainbow Lake was also the community that operated under new town status for the longest period \u2013 nearly 28 years from September 1 , 1966 to May 2 , 1994 . Other communities that applied for new town status included Slave Lake and Smith . Slave Lake applied , despite already being incorporated , to access additional provincial funding but the application was denied by the provincial cabinet . In the case of Smith , after applying in 1968 , its application was denied after the province 's feasibility study for the community determined Smith was unlikely to attract further economic development .

  "intro": "A town is an urban municipality status type used in the Canadian province of Alberta. Alberta towns are created when communities with populations of at least 1,000 people, where a majority of their buildings are on parcels of land smaller than 1,850 m2, apply to Alberta Municipal Affairs for town status under the authority of the Municipal Government Act. Applications for town status are approved via orders in council made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council under recommendation from the Minister of Municipal Affairs. Alberta has 106 towns that had a cumulative population of 455,053 and an average population of 4,293 in the 2016 Canadian Census. The number of towns decreased from 107 to 106 on February 1, 2020, when Granum dissolved from town status to become a hamlet. Alberta's largest and smallest towns are Okotoks and Stavely with populations of 28,881 and 541 respectively. Nobleford is Alberta's newest town, incorporating from village status on February 28, 2018. When a town's population exceeds 10,000 people, the council may request a change to city status, but the change in incorporated status is not mandatory. Towns with populations less than 1,000, whether their populations have declined below 1,000 or they were incorporated as towns prior to the minimum 1,000 population requirement, are permitted to retain town status. A total of 699 elected town officials (107 mayors and 592 councillors)[needs update] provide town governance throughout the province. The highest frequency of towns in Alberta is found in the Queen Elizabeth II Highway/Highway 2A corridor between Calgary and Edmonton corridor including, from south to north, Crossfield, Carstairs, Didsbury, Olds, Bowden, Innisfail, Penhold, Blackfalds, Ponoka and Millet."
