  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party .

  "/wiki/Radio": "Radio is the technology of signaling and communicating using radio waves . Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz ( Hz ) and 300 gigahertz ( GHz ) . They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves , and received by a radio receiver connected to another antenna . Radio is very widely used in modern technology , in radio communication , radar , radio navigation , remote control , remote sensing and other applications . In radio communication , used in radio and television broadcasting , cell phones , two-way radios , wireless networking and satellite communication among numerous other uses , radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver , by modulating the radio signal ( impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave ) in the transmitter . In radar , used to locate and track objects like aircraft , ships , spacecraft and missiles , a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object , and the reflected waves reveal the object 's location . In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR , a mobile receiver receives radio signals from navigational radio beacons whose position is known , and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth . In wireless radio remote control devices like drones , garage door openers , and keyless entry systems , radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device . Applications of radio waves which do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances , such as RF heating used in industrial processes and microwave ovens , and medical uses such as diathermy and MRI machines , are not usually called radio . The noun radio is also used to mean a broadcast radio receiver . Radio waves were first identified and studied by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1886 . The first practical radio transmitters and receivers were developed around 1895-6 by Italian Guglielmo Marconi , and radio began to be used commercially around 1900 .",

He is best known as the pilot who flew the B-29 Superfortress known as the Enola Gay ( named after his mother ) when it dropped Little Boy , the first of two atomic bombs used in warfare , on the Japanese city of Hiroshima . Tibbets enlisted in the United States Army in 1937 and qualified as a pilot in 1938 . After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , he flew anti-submarine patrols over the Atlantic . In February 1942 , he became the commanding officer of the 340th Bombardment Squadron of the 97th Bombardment Group , which was equipped with the Boeing B-17 . In July 1942 , the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group to be deployed as part of the Eighth Air Force , and Tibbets became deputy group commander . He flew the lead plane in the first American daylight heavy bomber mission against Occupied Europe on 17 August 1942 , and the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe on 9 October 1942 . Tibbets was chosen to fly Major General Mark W. Clark and Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower to Gibraltar . After flying 43 combat missions , he became the assistant for bomber operations on the staff of the Twelfth Air Force . Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943 to help with the development of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress . In September 1944 , he was appointed the commander of the 509th Composite Group , which would conduct the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .

On 6 August 1945 , during the final stages of World War II , piloted by Tibbets and Robert A. Lewis it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb . The bomb , code-named Little Boy , was targeted at the city of Hiroshima , Japan , and caused the near-complete destruction of the city . Enola Gay participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura . Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target , Nagasaki , being bombed instead . After the war , the Enola Gay returned to the United States , where it was operated from Roswell Army Air Field , New Mexico . In May 1946 , it was flown to Kwajalein for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Pacific , but was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll . Later that year it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution , and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters , before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian 's storage facility at Suitland , Maryland , in 1961 . In the 1980s , veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display , leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context . The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum ( NASM ) in downtown Washington , D.C. , for the bombing 's 50th anniversary in 1995 , amid controversy .

  "/wiki/Atomic_bomb": "A nuclear weapon ( also called an atom bomb , nuke , atomic bomb , nuclear warhead , A-bomb , or nuclear bomb ) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions , either fission ( fission bomb ) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions ( thermonuclear bomb ) . Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter . The first test of a fission ( atomic ) bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT ( 84 TJ ) . The first thermonuclear ( hydrogen ) bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT ( 42 PJ ) . A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of TNT ( 5.0 PJ ) . A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast , fire , and radiation . Since they are weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy . Nuclear weapons have been used twice in war , both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed Little Boy over the Japanese city of Hiroshima ; three days later , on August 9 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed Fat Man over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel . The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan 's surrender are subjects of debate . Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration .",
  "/wiki/Little_Boy": "Little Boy was the codename for the type of atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II . It was the first nuclear weapon used in warfare . The bomb was dropped by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets , Jr. , commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces and Captain Robert A. Lewis . It exploded with an energy of approximately 15 kilotons of TNT ( 63 TJ ) and caused widespread death and destruction throughout the city . The Hiroshima bombing was the second man-made nuclear explosion in history , after the Trinity test . Little Boy was developed by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch 's group at the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II , a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb . Like Thin Man , it was a gun-type fission weapon , but it derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235 , whereas Thin Man was based on fission of plutonium-239 . Fission was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium ( the bullet ) onto a solid cylinder of the same material ( the target ) by means of a charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder . It contained 64 kg ( 141 lb ) of enriched uranium , although less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission . Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the complete design . After the war ended , it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required , and many plans and diagrams were destroyed . However , by mid-1946 , the Hanford Site reactors began suffering badly from the Wigner effect , the dislocation of atoms in a solid caused by neutron radiation , and plutonium became scarce , so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base .",

In 1889 , Hiroshima officially gained city status . The city was a center of military activities during the imperial era , playing significant roles such as the First Sino-Japanese War , the Russo-Japanese War , and the two world wars . Towards the end of World War II , Hiroshima is best remembered as the first city targeted by a nuclear weapon , when the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) dropped an atomic bomb on the city at 8:15 a.m. on August 6 , 1945 . Most of the city was destroyed , and by the end of the year 90,000-166,000 had died as a result of the blast and its effects .
