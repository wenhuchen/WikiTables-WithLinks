  "section_text": "The West Midlands Built Up Area consists of the below settlements . Due to the change in methodology between the 2001 and 2011 Census , and the amount of change between 2011 Census and previous census data , it is impossible to compare the data directly between 2011 and earlier Censuses .",

  "intro": "The West Midlands conurbation is the large conurbation that includes the cities of Birmingham and Wolverhampton and the towns of Sutton Coldfield, Dudley, Walsall, West Bromwich, Solihull, Stourbridge and Halesowen in the English West Midlands. Not to be confused with the region or metropolitan county of the same name, the conurbation does not include parts of the metropolitan county such as Coventry, but does include parts of the surrounding counties of Staffordshire (e.g. Little Aston, Perton and Essington) and Worcestershire (such as Hagley and Hollywood). According to the 2011 Census the area had a population of 2,440,986, making it the third most populated in the United Kingdom behind the Greater London and Greater Manchester Built Up Areas. However it should be stated that the Conurbation sits within the UK's (and therefore England's) largest Metropolitan Area outside London (known as the Birmingham Metropolitan Area). The conurbation has several other unofficial names, such as Greater Birmingham, the Birmingham conurbation, the Birmingham-Wolverhampton conurbation and the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation with the latter gaining wide traction as an alternative to the generally unliked official name of the Conurbation. The conurbation is polycentric - Birmingham and Wolverhampton have separate Eurostat Larger Urban Zones, and there are separate Travel to Work areas defined for Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Dudley & Sandwell and Walsall & Cannock; whilst the extreme south-west corner of the conurbation at Hagley is within the Kidderminster Travel to Work Area, and the extreme south-east corner is within the Warwick & Stratford upon Avon TTWA."
