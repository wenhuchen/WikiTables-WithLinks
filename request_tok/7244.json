  "/wiki/The_Jungle_Book": "The Jungle Book ( 1894 ) is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling . Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear , though a principal character is the boy or man-cub Mowgli , who is raised in the jungle by wolves . The stories are set in a forest in India ; one place mentioned repeatedly is Seonee ( Seoni ) , in the central state of Madhya Pradesh . A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering , as in the life of Mowgli , echoing Kipling 's own childhood . The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies , as well as Mowgli 's . Another important theme is of law and freedom ; the stories are not about animal behaviour , still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival , but about human archetypes in animal form . They teach respect for authority , obedience , and knowing one 's place in society with the law of the jungle , but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds , such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village . Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories , reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature . The Jungle Book has remained popular , partly through its many adaptations for film and other media . Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling . The book has been influential in the scout movement , whose founder , Robert Baden-Powell , was a friend of Kipling 's . Percy Grainger composed his Jungle Book Cycle around quotations from the book .",

He was born in India , which inspired much of his work . Kipling 's works of fiction include The Jungle Book ( 1894 ) , Kim ( 1901 ) , and many short stories , including The Man Who Would Be King ( 1888 ) . His poems include Mandalay ( 1890 ) , Gunga Din ( 1890 ) , The Gods of the Copybook Headings ( 1919 ) , The White Man 's Burden ( 1899 ) , and If - ( 1910 ) . He is seen as an innovator in the art of the short story . His children 's books are classics ; one critic noted a versatile and luminous narrative gift . Kipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdom 's most popular writers . Henry James said , Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius , as distinct from fine intelligence , that I have ever known . In 1907 , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature , as the first English-language writer to receive the prize , and at 41 , its youngest recipient to date . He was also sounded for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood , but declined both . Following his death in 1936 , his ashes were interred at Poets ' Corner , part of the South Transept of Westminster Abbey . Kipling 's subsequent reputation has changed with the political and social climate of the age .",

Three main stories interweave : a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros , the rising threat of the supernatural Others in northernmost Westeros , and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen , the deposed king 's exiled daughter , to assume the Iron Throne . Martin 's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon .

He is best known for his works of fiction , especially The Screwtape Letters , The Chronicles of Narnia , and The Space Trilogy , and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics , such as Mere Christianity , Miracles , and The Problem of Pain . Lewis and fellow novelist J. R. R. Tolkien were close friends . They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings . According to Lewis 's memoir Surprised by Joy , he was baptised in the Church of Ireland , but fell away from his faith during adolescence . Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32 , owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends , and he became an ordinary layman of the Church of England . Lewis 's faith profoundly affected his work , and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim . Lewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies . The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularised on stage , TV , radio , and cinema .
