Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year ; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming . Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries . About 290 km ( 180 mi ) south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta . Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta 's two census metropolitan areas , both of which have populations exceeding one million , while the province has 16 census agglomerations .
