  "/wiki/1900_Summer_Olympics": "The 1900 Summer Olympics ( French : Les Jeux olympiques d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1900 ) , today officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event that took place in Paris , France , in 1900 . No opening or closing ceremonies were held ; competitions began on 14 May and ended on 28 October . The Games were held as part of the 1900 World 's Fair . In total , 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports . This number relies on certain assumptions about which events were and were not Olympic . Many athletes , among them some who won events , did n't know that they had competed in the Olympic Games . Women took part in the games for the first time , and sailor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Pourtal\u00e8s , born Helen Barbey in New York City , became the first female Olympic champion . The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes , who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest . At the Sorbonne conference of 1894 , Pierre de Coubertin proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in 1900 in Paris . The delegates to the conference were unwilling to wait six years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896 . A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and that Paris would host the second celebration . Most of the winners in 1900 did not receive medals , but were given cups or trophies .",

It was the first time that the Olympic Games were held outside Europe . Boxing , the oldest combat sport , was introduced . Tensions caused by the Russo-Japanese War and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis in 1904 may have contributed to the fact that very few top ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in these Games . Only 62 of the 651 athletes who competed came from outside North America , and only 12-15 nations were represented in all . Some events combined the U.S. national championship with the Olympic championship .

A second American team , the Brooklyn Crescents , was originally slated to round out the field but did not participate . In June , they were ruled to have used professional players that spring ; however , they were still scheduled to play a semi-final against the Shamrocks , but did not show for the match . Recent scholarship has indicated that the lacrosse tournament at the 1904 Games is nowhere near as orderly as presented above -- among other things , the game between Triple A and Mohawk Indians was actually a four-game series , tied at two games apiece , and the Mohawks may not have been an Olympic team at all , but a participant in an indigenous games competition with other tribes .",

These Games , which were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States , marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens - the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games . They were also the first since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics , under a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating , even-numbered years . More than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports , including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball , mountain biking , and softball , as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing and women 's football ( soccer ) . 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debut in Atlanta , including eleven former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations . The hosting United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals , and the most gold ( 44 ) and silver ( 32 ) medals out of all countries . The U.S. topped the medal count for the first time since 1984 , and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics . Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi - who became the first men 's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal , Donovan Bailey - who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men 's 100 meters , and Lilia Podkopayeva - who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics . The festivities were marred by violence on July 27 , when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park - a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games ' festivities , killing 1 and injuring 111 . In 2003 , Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related attacks on abortion centers and a gay bar , and was sentenced to life in prison . He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government 's sanctioning of abortion on demand . The Games turned a profit , helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights , and reliance on private funding ( as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics ) , among other factors .",

Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance . 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began . Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system . There have been arguments ( mostly in popular media ) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis , however , there is little or no evidence for such a correlation . The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success , with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world .",
