The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 .

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",

  "/wiki/English_Civil_War": "The English Civil War ( 1642-1651 ) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians ( Roundheads ) and Royalists ( Cavaliers ) principally over the manner of England 's governance . The first ( 1642-1646 ) and second ( 1648-1649 ) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament , while the third ( 1649-1651 ) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament . The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 . The outcome of the war was threefold : the trial and execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) ; the exile of his son , Charles II ( 1651 ) ; and the replacement of English monarchy with , at first , the Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1653 ) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell ( 1653-1658 ) and briefly his son Richard ( 1658-1659 ) . A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy . Constitutionally , the wars established the precedent that an English monarch can not govern without Parliament 's consent , although the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was only legally established as part of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 .",

  "/wiki/Victorian_era": "In the history of the United Kingdom , the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign , from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901 . The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine . Between 1837 and 1901 about 15 million emigrated from Great Britain , mostly to the United States , Canada , South Africa , New Zealand , and Australia .",

Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations , the Pomp and Circumstance Marches , concertos for violin and cello , and two symphonies . He also composed choral works , including The Dream of Gerontius , chamber music and songs . He was appointed Master of the King 's Musick in 1924 . Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer , most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe . He felt himself to be an outsider , not only musically , but socially . In musical circles dominated by academics , he was a self-taught composer ; in Protestant Britain , his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters ; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain , he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition . He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer . She inspired him both musically and socially , but he struggled to achieve success until his forties , when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations ( 1899 ) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas . He followed the Variations with a choral work , The Dream of Gerontius ( 1900 ) , based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain , but it became , and has remained , a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere . His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory .

Before the death of his father ( Sir Thomas Lyttelton ) in 1751 , he began to landscape the grounds in the new Picturesque style , and between 1754 and 1760 it was he who was responsible for the building of the Neo-Palladian house that survives to this day . After a fire in 1925 , most of the house was restored , but the uppermost floor of the servants ' quarters was not , which means that the present roof line between the towers is lower than it was when first constructed . The estate fell into disrepair and incurred a mounting debt beginning in the 1970s . The 11th Viscount Cobham was forced to sell off large tracts of estate land to keep it afloat ( in addition to paying for his high-profile divorce ) .

Despite being called an order , the Benedictines do not operate under a single hierarchy but are instead organised as a collection of independent monastic communities , with each community ( monastery , priory or abbey ) within the order maintaining its autonomy . Unlike other religious orders , the Benedictines do not have a superior general or motherhouse with universal jurisdiction . Instead , the order is represented internationally by the Benedictine Confederation , an organization that was set up in 1893 to represent the order 's shared interests ."
