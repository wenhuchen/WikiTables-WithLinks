In the north unit of the park , it turns eastward and flows into the Missouri in Dunn County at Lake Sakakawea , where it forms an arm of the reservoir 30 miles ( 48 km ) long called Little Missouri Bay and joins the main channel of the Missouri about 25 miles ( 40 km ) northeast of Killdeer . The highly seasonal runoff from badlands and other treeless landscapes along the Little Missouri carries heavy loads of eroded sediment downstream . The sedimentary layers , which extend from the headwaters in Wyoming all the way to the mouth in North Dakota , vary in age , but most of the beds along the river belong to the Bullion Creek and Sentinel Butte formations , both deposited during the Paleocene ( about 66 to 56 million years ago ) .

Enclaved within its borders is Theodore Roosevelt National Park , which is managed by the National Park Service ( and therefore not included in the preceding statistics ) .

A predominant feature of the grassland is colorful and beautiful badlands , a rugged terrain extensively eroded by wind and water . It is a mixed grass prairie , meaning it has both long and short grass . The boundaries of the grasslands on certain maps can be misleading . Within the boundaries of the national grassland are significant portions of state-owned and privately owned land , much of it leased by cattle ranchers for grazing . Overall , in descending order of land area , it is located in parts of McKenzie , Billings , Slope , and Golden Valley counties . Private land intersperses the public grassland acres and there is heavy cattle grazing throughout with 253 allotments in the Medora district and more than 190 allotments in the Mckenzie district .

  "/wiki/Elkhorn_Ranch": "The Elkhorn Ranch was established by Theodore Roosevelt on the banks of the Little Missouri River 35 miles north of Medora , North Dakota in the summer of 1884 . Roosevelt hired Bill Sewall and Wilmot Dow , two Maine woodsmen , to run the ranch . Sewall and Dow built the ranch house , a long , low house of logs , in the winter of 1884-1885 . The Elkhorn Ranch was Theodore Roosevelt 's main ranch , and his preferred ranch house because it was larger and more private than his Maltese Cross Ranch cabin , established in 1883 . Roosevelt particularly enjoyed sitting in the veranda in a rocking chair , reading in the shade of the cottonwood trees . His enjoyment is evident in his books , Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail , Hunting Trips of a Ranchman , and The Wilderness Hunter . In the spring of 1886 , thieves stole Roosevelt 's boat from the Elkhorn Ranch . Hastily , Sewall and Dow built a raft and all three set off downriver to catch the thieves . When they did , Roosevelt kept watch over the three thieves with a shotgun and marched them overland to Dickinson , North Dakota , where he collected a $ 50 reward . Roosevelt quit the ranch in 1887 after losing 60% of his stock in the starvation winter of 1886-87 , and returned only a handful of times to the badlands after that . He kept a small share of the cattle until 1898 at the outset of the Spanish-American War . Theodore Roosevelt 's writing desk from the Elkhorn Ranch is on display at Theodore Roosevelt National Park .",
