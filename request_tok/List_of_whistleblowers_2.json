  "/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency": "The Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States , tasked with gathering , processing , and analyzing national security information from around the world , primarily through the use of human intelligence ( HUMINT ) . As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community ( IC ) , the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States . Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates . The CIA has increasingly expanded its role , including covert paramilitary operations . One of its largest divisions , the Information Operations Center ( IOC ) , has shifted focus from counter-terrorism to offensive cyber-operations .",
  "/wiki/Indonesian_killings_of_1965\u20131966": "The Indonesian mass killings of 1965-66 ( Indonesian genocide , :4 Indonesian Communist Purge , Indonesian politicide , or the 1965 Tragedy ) were large-scale killings and civil unrest that occurred in Indonesia over several months , targeting Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) party members , Communist sympathisers , Gerwani women , ethnic Abangan Javanese , ethnic Chinese and alleged leftists , often at the instigation of the armed forces and government . It began as an anti-communist purge following a controversial attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by the 30 September Movement . The most widely published estimates were that 500,000 to more than one million people were killed , :3 with some more recent estimates going as high as two to three million . The purge was a pivotal event in the transition to the New Order and the elimination of the Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) as a political force , with impacts on the global Cold War . The upheavals led to the fall of President Sukarno and the commencement of Suharto 's three-decade authoritarian presidency . The claims of a coup attempt by Communists released pent-up communal hatreds ; these were fanned by the Indonesian Army , which quickly blamed the PKI . Communists were purged from political , social , and military life , and the PKI itself was disbanded and banned . The massacres began in October 1965 , in the weeks following the coup attempt , and reached their peak over the remainder of the year before subsiding in the early months of 1966 . They started in the capital , Jakarta , and spread to Central and East Java , and later Bali . Thousands of local vigilantes and army units killed actual and alleged PKI members . Killings occurred across the country , with the worst in the PKI strongholds of Central Java , East Java , Bali , and northern Sumatra . It is possible that over one million people were imprisoned at one time or another .",

The conflict began on 2 April , when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands , followed by the invasion of South Georgia the next day . On 5 April , the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands . The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June , returning the islands to British control . In total , 649 Argentine military personnel , 255 British military personnel , and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities . The conflict was a major episode in the protracted dispute over the territories ' sovereignty . Argentina asserted ( and maintains ) that the islands are Argentine territory , and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory . The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841 . Falkland Islanders , who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century , are predominantly descendants of British settlers , and strongly favour British sovereignty . Neither state officially declared war , although both governments declared the Islands a war zone . Hostilities were almost exclusively limited to the territories under dispute and the area of the South Atlantic where they lie . The conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books , articles , films , and songs .",

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to hold that office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies known as Thatcherism . Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College , Oxford , and worked briefly as a research chemist , before becoming a barrister . She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970-74 government . In 1975 , she defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition , the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . On becoming Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election , she introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . [ nb 1 ] Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her landslide re-election in 1983 .

  "/wiki/B1_Lancer": "The Rockwell B-1 Lancer [ N 1 ] is a supersonic variable-sweep wing , heavy bomber used by the United States Air Force . It is commonly called the Bone ( from B-One ) . It is one of three strategic bombers in the U.S. Air Force fleet as of 2020 [ update ] , the other two being the B-2 Spirit and the B-52 Stratofortress . The B-1 was first envisioned in the 1960s as a platform that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of the B-52 , and was meant to ultimately replace both bombers . After a long series of studies , Rockwell International ( now part of Boeing ) won the design contest for what emerged as the B-1A . This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the capability of flying for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes . The combination of the high cost of the aircraft , the introduction of the AGM-86 cruise missile that flew the same basic profile , and early work on the stealth bomber all significantly affected the need for the B-1 . This led to the program being canceled in 1977 , after the B-1A prototypes had been built . The program was restarted in 1981 , largely as an interim measure due to delays in the B-2 stealth bomber program , with the B-2 eventually reaching initial operational capability in 1997 . This led to a redesign as the B-1B , which differed from the B-1A by having a lower top speed at high altitude of Mach 1.25 , but improved low-altitude performance of Mach 0.96 . The electronics were also extensively improved during the redesign , and the airframe was improved to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and weapons load . The B-1B began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) as a nuclear bomber in that same year .",

The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair .

His tenure as prime minister was marked by the introduction of major economic reforms , such as the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the Goods and Services Tax . Prior to his political career , he was a prominent lawyer and businessman in Montreal . He later ran for the Progressive Conservatives and won in a landslide in the 1984 Canadian federal election , defeating John Turner of the Liberals and Ed Broadbent of the NDP , not only winning every single province and territory but also capturing over 50% of the vote for the first time since 1958 and increasing his party 's seats by 111 , up to 211 seats , the highest amount of seats won by any party in Canadian history . The 6.3 million votes won by Mulroney also remained a record until the Liberals ' victory in 2015 . Throughout his political career , Mulroney 's fluency in English and French gave him a decisive advantage . He brought forth a constitutional reform , the Meech Lake Accord , in 1987 , meant to persuade the government of Quebec to endorse the 1982 constitutional amendments . It was not ratified by the provincial governments of Manitoba and Newfoundland before the June ratification deadline , and thus met its demise in 1990 . This loss led to another round of meetings in Charlottetown in 1991 and 1992 . These negotiations culminated in Mulroney introducing the Charlottetown Accord , which would create extensive changes to the constitution , including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society . However , the agreement was defeated by a large margin in a national referendum in October 1992 . Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney 's rising unpopularity for the fall of the Accord .",

The scandal relates to illegal kickbacks paid in a US $ 1.4-billion deal between the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors with the government of India for the sale of 410 field howitzer guns , and a supply contract almost twice that amount . It was the biggest arms deal ever in Sweden , and money marked for development projects was diverted to secure this contract at any cost . The investigations revealed flouting of rules and bypassing of institutions . On 16 April 1987 , a Swedish newspaper broke out a story based on a whistleblower in the Swedish police , alleging that the reputed Swedish artillery manufacturer Bofors had paid kickbacks to people in several countries , including Sweden and India , to secure a Rs 1,500-crore contract . This had been done the previous year for a deal to supply 410 155-mm calibre howitzer guns for the Indian army . However , none of the newspapers in India were aware of this . In May 1986 , a broadcast by a Swedish radio station revealed that bribes of Rs . 60 crore had been paid by Bofors to Indian politicians , members of the Congress party and bureaucrats . This was picked up by a young journalist from The Hindu , Chitra Subramaniam , who happened to be in Sweden at that time , covering another story . The scale of the corruption was far worse than any that Sweden and India had seen before and directly led to the defeat of Gandhi 's ruling Indian National Congress party in the November 1989 general elections .

  "/wiki/Cathy_Massiter": "Cathy Massiter is a British whistleblower and former member of MI5 who revealed that the British security service carried out surveillance of British trade unions , civil rights organisations and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament . She sustained her revelations via a affidavit . From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s , the MI5 designated the CND , an anti-nuclear weapons organisation , as subversive by virtue of its being communist controlled . Communists had played an active role in the organisation , and John Cox , its chairman from 1971 to 1977 , was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain . From the late 1970s , MI5 downgraded CND to communist-penetrated . In 1985 , Massiter , who as an MI5 officer had been responsible for the surveillance of CND from 1981 to 1983 , resigned and made disclosures to a Channel 4 20/20 Vision programme , MI5 's Official Secrets . She said that her work was determined more by the political importance of CND than by any security threat posed by subversive elements within it , and argued that the organisation was contravening the rules governing its practices . In 1983 , she analysed telephone intercepts on John Cox that gave her access to conversations with Joan Ruddock and Bruce Kent . MI5 also placed a spy , Harry Newton , in the CND office . According to Massiter , Newton believed that CND was controlled by extreme left-wing activists and that Bruce Kent might be a crypto-communist , but Massiter found no evidence to support either opinion . CND activist Pat Arrowsmith , who had known Newton for twenty-five years , disputed the veracity of Massiter 's allegations against him .

  "/wiki/Subversive": "Subversion ( Latin subvertere : overthrow ) refers to a process by which the values and principles of a system in place are contradicted or reversed , in an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power , authority , hierarchy , and social norms . Subversion can be described as an attack on the public morale and , the will to resist intervention are the products of combined political and social or class loyalties which are usually attached to national symbols . Following penetration , and parallel with the forced disintegration of political and social institutions of the state , these loyalties may be detached and transferred to the political or ideological cause of the aggressor . Subversion is used as a tool to achieve political goals because it generally carries less risk , cost , and difficulty as opposed to open belligerency . Furthermore , it is a relatively cheap form of warfare that does not require large amounts of training . A subversive is something or someone carrying the potential for some degree of subversion . In this context , a subversive is sometimes called a traitor with respect to ( and usually by ) the government in power . Subversion , however , is also often a goal of comedians , artists and people in those careers . In this case , being subversive can mean questioning , poking fun at , and undermining the established order in general . When a comedy or comic is referred to as being subversive , it is as much of a compliment to their work as it could be an accusation , from comics like Charlie Chaplin , Lenny Bruce , Andy Kaufman and Stephen Colbert to writers like Paddy Chayefsky , Larry Charles and Mel Brooks , to activists like Abbie Hoffman , and Michael Moore , to artists like The Yes Men and monochrom . Satire is one of the most potent forms of subversion for artists and comics , and it can take shape in films , television , books , and even political protest .",

CND began in November 1957 when a committee was formed , including Canon John Collins as chairman , Bertrand Russell as president and Peggy Duff as organising secretary . The committee organised CND 's first public meeting at Methodist Central Hall , Westminster , on 17 February 1958 . Since then , CND has periodically been at the forefront of the peace movement in the UK . It claims to be Europe 's largest single-issue peace campaign .

  "/wiki/Electric_Bond_and_Share_Company": "The Electric Bond and Share Company ( Ebasco ) was a United States electric utility holding company organized by General Electric . It was forced to divest its holding companies and reorganize due to the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 . Following the passage of the Act , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) selected the largest of the U.S. holding companies , Ebasco to be the test case of the law before the U.S. Supreme Court . The court case known as Securities and Exchange Commission v. Electric Bond and Share company was settled in favor of the SEC on March 28th 1938 . It took twenty-five years of legal action by the SEC to break up Ebasco and the other major U.S. electric holding companies until they conformed with the 1935 act . It was allowed to retain control of its foreign electric power holding company known as the American & Foreign Power Company ( A & FP ) . After its reorganization , it became an investment company , but soon turned into a major designer and engineer of both fossil fuel and nuclear power electric generation facilities . Its involvement in the 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System 's five nuclear reactors led to Ebasco 's demise because of the suspension of nuclear power orders and lawsuits that included numerous asbestos claims .

Estimates of Israel 's stockpile range between 80 and 400 nuclear warheads , and the country is believed to possess the ability to deliver them in several methods , including by aircraft ; as submarine-launched cruise missiles ; and the Jericho series of intermediate to intercontinental range ballistic missiles . Its first deliverable nuclear weapon is thought to have been completed in late 1966 or early 1967 ; which would make it the sixth country in the world to have developed them . However , Israel maintains a policy of deliberate ambiguity , never officially denying nor admitting to having nuclear weapons , instead repeating over the years that Israel will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons to the Middle East . Israel has also declined to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , despite international pressure to do so , saying that would be contrary to its national security interests . Additionally , Israel developed the Begin Doctrine of counter-proliferation and preventive strikes , denying other regional actors the ability to acquire their own nuclear weapons . The Israeli Air Force conducted Operation Opera and Operation Orchard , destroying the Iraqi and Syrian nuclear reactors in 1981 and 2007 , respectively , and the Stuxnet malware that severely damaged Iranian nuclear facilities in 2010 is thought to have been developed by Israel . As of 2019 , Israel remains the only country in the Middle East believed to possess nuclear weapons . The Samson Option refers to Israel 's deterrence strategy of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons as a last resort against a country whose military has invaded and/or destroyed much of Israel .

  "/wiki/History_of_British_newspapers": "The history of British newspapers dates to the 17th century with the emergence of regular publications covering news and gossip . The relaxation of government censorship in the late 17th century led to a rise in publications , which in turn led to an increase in regulation throughout the 18th century . The Times began publication in 1785 and became the leading newspaper of the early 19th century , before the lifting of taxes on newspapers and technological innovations led to a boom in newspaper publishing in the late 19th century . Mass education and increasing affluence led to new papers such as the Daily Mail emerging at the end of the 19th century , aimed at lower middle-class readers . In the early 20th century the British press was dominated by a few wealthy press barons . In a bid to increase circulation many papers included more popular and human-interest stories , as well as sports and other features . In 1969 Rupert Murdoch bought and relaunched The Sun as a tabloid and soon added pictures of topless models on Page 3 . Within a few years the Sun was the UK 's most popular newspaper . In the 1980s national newspapers began to move out of Fleet Street , the traditional home of the British national press since the 18th century . By the early 21st century newspaper circulation began to decline . In the early 2010s many British newspapers were implicated in a major phone hacking scandal which led to the closure of the News of the World after 168 years of publication and the Leveson Inquiry into press standards .",

Entering Parliament in 1945 , Wilson was appointed a parliamentary secretary in the Attlee ministry and rose quickly through the ministerial ranks ; he became Secretary for Overseas Trade in 1947 and was elevated to Cabinet shortly thereafter as President of the Board of Trade . In opposition to the next Conservative government , he served as Shadow Chancellor ( 1955-1961 ) and Shadow Foreign Secretary ( 1961-1963 ) . After Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell died suddenly in 1963 , Wilson won the subsequent leadership election . After narrowly winning the 1964 general election , Wilson saw an increased majority in a snap election in 1966 . Wilson 's first period as Prime Minister coincided with a period of low unemployment and relative economic prosperity , though hindered by significant problems with Britain 's external balance of payments . In 1969 he sent British troops to Northern Ireland . After losing the 1970 election to Edward Heath , he spent four years as Leader of the Opposition before the February 1974 election resulted in a hung parliament . After Heath 's talks with the Liberals broke down , Wilson returned to power as leader of a minority government until another general election in October , resulting in a narrow Labour victory . A period of economic crisis had begun to hit most Western countries , and in 1976 Wilson suddenly announced his resignation as Prime Minister . Wilson 's approach to socialism was moderate compared with others in his party at the time , emphasising programmes aimed at increasing opportunity in society through relatively indirect means rather than the more direct socialist goal of promoting wider public ownership of industry and workers ' control of production . He took little action to pursue the Labour Party constitution 's stated dedication to public ownership as a stepping stone towards this goal , though he did not formally disavow it .",

Uses of gag orders include keeping trade secrets of a company , protecting the integrity of ongoing police or military operations , and protecting the privacy of victims or minors .

Strategic lawsuit against public participation ( SLAPP ) orders may potentially be abused in this way . Gag orders are sometimes used in an attempt to assure a fair trial by preventing prejudicial pre-trial publicity , although their use for this purpose is controversial since they are a potentially unconstitutional prior restraint that can lead to the press 's using less reliable sources such as off-the-record statements and second- or third-hand accounts .

The B-2 is the only acknowledged aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface standoff weapons in a stealth configuration . Development started under the Advanced Technology Bomber ( ATB ) project during the Carter administration ; its expected performance was one of the President 's reasons for the cancellation of the Mach 2 capable B-1A bomber . The ATB project continued during the Reagan administration , but worries about delays in its introduction led to the reinstatement of the B-1 program . Program costs rose throughout development .

In criminal law , it may criminalize actions that were legal when committed ; it may aggravate a crime by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed ; it may change the punishment prescribed for a crime , as by adding new penalties or extending sentences ; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed . Conversely , a form of ex post facto law commonly called an amnesty law may decriminalize certain acts . ( Alternatively , rather than redefining the relevant acts as non-criminal , it may simply prohibit prosecution ; or it may enact that there is to be no punishment , but leave the underlying conviction technically unaltered . ) A pardon has a similar effect , in a specific case instead of a class of cases ( though a pardon more often leaves the conviction itself - the finding of guilt - unaltered , and occasionally pardons are refused for this reason ) . Other legal changes may alleviate possible punishments ( for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment ) retroactively . Such legal changes are also known by the Latin term in mitius . Some common-law jurisdictions do not permit retroactive criminal legislation , though new precedent generally applies to events that occurred before the judicial decision . Ex post facto laws are expressly forbidden by the United States Constitution in Article 1 , Section 9 , Clause 3 ( with respect to federal laws ) and Article 1 , Section 10 ( with respect to state laws ) . In some nations that follow the Westminster system of government , such as the United Kingdom , ex post facto laws are technically possible , because the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy allows Parliament to pass any law it wishes . In a nation with an entrenched bill of rights or a written constitution , ex post facto legislation may be prohibited .",
  "/wiki/Mobil": "Mobil , previously known as the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company , is a major American oil company that merged with Exxon in 1999 to form a parent company called ExxonMobil . It was previously one of the Seven Sisters that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s until the 1970s . Today , Mobil continues as a major brand name within the combined company , as well as still being a gas station sometimes paired with its own store or On the Run . The former Mobil headquarters in Fairfax County , Virginia , was used as ExxonMobil 's downstream headquarters until 2015 when ExxonMobil consolidated employees into a new corporate campus in Spring , Texas .",
  "/wiki/Toxicologist": "Toxicology is a scientific discipline , overlapping with biology , chemistry , pharmacology , and medicine , that involves the study of the adverse effects of chemical substances on living organisms and the practice of diagnosing and treating exposures to toxins and toxicants . The relationship between dose and its effects on the exposed organism is of high significance in toxicology . Factors that influence chemical toxicity include the dosage , duration of exposure ( whether it is acute or chronic ) , route of exposure , species , age , sex , and environment . Toxicologists are experts on poisons and poisoning . There is a movement for evidence-based toxicology as part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices .",
  "/wiki/Benzene": "Benzene is an organic chemical compound with the molecular formula C6H6 . The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms joined in a ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each . As it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms , benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon . Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil and is one of the elementary petrochemicals . Due to the cyclic continuous pi bond between the carbon atoms , benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon , the second [ n ] -annulene ( -annulene ) . It is sometimes abbreviated PhH . Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell , and is responsible for the aroma around petrol ( gasoline ) stations . It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure , such as ethylbenzene and cumene , of which billions of kilograms are produced annually . As benzene has a high octane number , aromatic derivatives like toluene and xylene typically comprise up to 25% of gasoline ( petrol ) . Benzene itself has been limited to less than 1% in gasoline because it is a known human carcinogen . Most non-industrial applications have been limited as well for the same reason ."
