  "/wiki/Alta_California": "Alta California ( 'Upper California ' ) , known sometimes unofficially as Nueva California ( 'New California ' ) , California Septentrional ( 'Northern California ' ) , California del Norte ( 'North California ' ) or California Superior ( 'Upper California ' ) , began in 1804 as a province of New Spain . Along with the Baja California peninsula , it had previously comprised the province of Las Californias , but was split off into a separate province in 1804 . Following the Mexican War of Independence , it became a territory of Mexico in April 1822 and was renamed Alta California in 1824 . The claimed territory included all of the modern US states of California , Nevada and Utah , and parts of Arizona , Wyoming , Colorado and New Mexico . In the 1836 Siete Leyes government reorganization , the two Californias were once again combined into a single departamento . That change was undone in 1846 , but rendered moot by U.S. military occupation of California in the Mexican-American War . Neither Spain nor Mexico ever colonized the area beyond the southern and central coastal areas of present-day California , and small areas of present-day Arizona , so they exerted no effective control in modern-day California north of the Sonoma area , or east of the California Coast Ranges . Most interior areas such as the Central Valley and the deserts of California remained in de facto possession of indigenous peoples until later in the Mexican era when more inland land grants were made , and especially after 1841 when overland immigrants from the United States began to settle inland areas . Large areas east of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges were claimed to be part of Alta California , but were never colonized . To the southeast , beyond the deserts and the Colorado River , lay the Spanish settlements in Arizona . [ a ] [ b ] Alta California ceased to exist as an administrative division separate from Baja California in 1836 , when the Siete Leyes constitutional reforms in Mexico re-established Las Californias as a unified department , granting it ( in some ways ) more autonomy . Most of the areas formerly comprising Alta California were ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican-American War in 1848 .",
