It is located at the northern tip of Fort George Island at Fort George Inlet , and is part of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve managed by the U.S. National Park Service . The plantation was originally 1,000 acres ( 4.0 km2 ) , most of which has been taken over by forest ; the structures and grounds of the park now comprise approximately 60 acres ( 242,811.385 m2 ) . Evidence of Pre-Columbian Timucua life is on the island , as are the remains of a Spanish mission named San Juan del Puerto . Under British rule in 1765 , a plantation was established that cycled through several owners while Florida was transferred back to Spain and then the United States . The longest span of ownership was under Kingsley and his family , a polygamous and multiracial household controlled by and resistant to the issues of race and slavery . Free blacks and several private owners lived at the plantation until it was transferred to the State of Florida in 1955 . It was acquired by the National Park Service in 1991 . The most prominent features of Kingsley Plantation are the owner 's house - a structure of architectural significance built probably between 1797 and 1798 that is cited as being the oldest surviving plantation house in the state - and an attached kitchen house , barn , and remains of 25 anthropologically valuable slave cabins that endured beyond the U.S. Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) . The foundations of the house , kitchen , barn and the slave quarters were constructed of cement tabby , making them notably durable . Archeological evidence found in and around the slave cabins has given researchers insight into African traditions among slaves who had recently arrived in North America . Zephaniah Kingsley wrote a defense of slavery and the three-tier social system that acknowledged the rights of free people of color that existed in Florida under Spanish rule .",
