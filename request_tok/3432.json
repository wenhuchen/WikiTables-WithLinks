The commander of the Iran 's Revolutionary Guards ' air force , Hossein Salami , said that the test proved that our missiles are ready for shooting at any place and any time , quickly and with accuracy .

'Army of Guardians of the Islamic Revolution ' or Sep\u00e2h for short ) is a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces , founded after the Iranian Revolution on 22 April 1979 by order of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . Whereas the Iranian Army defends Iranian borders and maintains internal order , according to the Iranian constitution , the Revolutionary Guard ( pasdaran ) is intended to protect the country 's Islamic republic political system . The Revolutionary Guards base their role in protecting the Islamic system as well as preventing foreign interference and coups by the military or deviant movements . The Revolutionary Guards have roughly 125,000 military personnel including ground , aerospace and naval forces . Its naval forces are now the primary forces tasked with operational control of the Persian Gulf . It also controls the paramilitary Basij militia which has about 90,000 active personnel . Its media arm is Sepah News . Since its origin as an ideologically driven militia , the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution has taken a greater role in nearly every aspect of Iranian society . Its expanded social , political , military and economic role under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's administration - especially during the 2009 presidential election and post-election suppression of protest - has led many Western analysts to argue that its political power has surpassed even that of the country 's Shia clerical system . The Chief Commander of the Guardians since 2019 is Hossein Salami who was preceded by Mohammad Ali Jafari and Yahya Rahim Safavi respectively from 2007 and 1997 . The IRGC is designated as a terrorist organization by the governments of Bahrain , Saudi Arabia and the United States .",

  "/wiki/Kim_Jong-il": "Kim Jong-il ( officially transcribed Kim Jong Il ; Korean : \uae40\uc815\uc77c ; Korean pronunciation : [ kim.dz\u0254\u014b.il ] ; [ a ] 16 February 1941 or 1942 - 17 December 2011 ) was the second leader of North Korea . He ruled from the death of his father , Kim Il-sung , the first leader of North Korea in 1994 until his own death in 2011 . In the early 1980s , Kim had become the heir apparent for the leadership of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) and assumed important posts in the party and army organs . Kim succeeded his father and DPRK founder Kim Il-sung , following the elder Kim 's death in 1994 . Kim was the General Secretary of the Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , WPK Presidium , Chairman of the National Defence Commission ( NDC ) of North Korea and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) , the fourth-largest standing army in the world . Kim assumed supreme leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union , on which it was heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies , which brought a famine . While the famine had ended by the late 1990s , food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his tenure due in part to the country 's mountainous geography unsuited for high-yielding agriculture as well as externally-imposed sanctions due to concerns about the country 's human rights situation . Kim strengthened the role of the military by his Songun ( military-first ) policies , making the army the central organizer of civil society . Kim 's rule also saw tentative economic reforms , including the opening of the Kaesong Industrial Park in 2003 . In April 2009 , North Korea 's constitution was amended to refer to him and his successors as the supreme leader of the DPRK . Outside observers have characterized him as a dictator and accused him of human rights violations . The most common colloquial title given to Kim was Dear Leader to distinguish him from his father Kim Il-sung , the Great Leader .",
