  "/wiki/Apostle_Islands_Lighthouses": "There are several historic lighthouses on Lake Superior on or near the Apostle Islands in Wisconsin . Six of these lighthouses , all in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore , were listed as a group on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 under the name Apostle Islands Lighthouses . The lighthouses are generally located at the edge of the group of islands , as beacons to guide shipping through and around the islands . The need for guidance increased in 1855 when the Soo Locks opened , connecting Lake Superior to the St. Lawrence Seaway to the east . Shipping also increased as Duluth-Superior grew , and with the opening of Ashland 's first ore dock in 1886 . The Apostle Islands lighthouses are popular among tourists . Lighthouse historian Terry Pepper has described them as one of the more interesting geographically centered collection of [ lighthouse ] structures in the United States . Another lighthouse historian , F. Ross Holland , has called them the largest and finest single collection of lighthouses in the country . The following lighthouses were included in the 1977 National Register listing :",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Fish_hatchery": "A fish hatchery is a place for artificial breeding , hatching , and rearing through the early life stages of animals - finfish and shellfish in particular . Hatcheries produce larval and juvenile fish , shellfish , and crustaceans , primarily to support the aquaculture industry where they are transferred to on-growing systems , such as fish farms , to reach harvest size . Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include Pacific oysters , shrimp , Indian prawns , salmon , tilapia and scallops . The value of global aquaculture production is estimated to be US $ 98.4 billion in 2008 with China significantly dominating the market ; however , the value of aquaculture hatchery and nursery production has yet to be estimated . Additional hatchery production for small-scale domestic uses , which is particularly prevalent in South-East Asia or for conservation programmes , has also yet to be quantified . There is much interest in supplementing exploited stocks of fish by releasing juveniles that may be wild caught and reared in nurseries before transplanting , or produced solely within a hatchery . Culture of finfish larvae has been utilised extensively in the United States in stock enhancement efforts to replenish natural populations . The U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service have established a National Fish Hatchery System to support the conservation of native fish species .",
  "/wiki/Gambrel": "A gambrel or gambrel roof is a usually symmetrical two-sided roof with two slopes on each side . ( The usual architectural term in eighteenth-century England and North America was Dutch roof . ) The upper slope is positioned at a shallow angle , while the lower slope is steep . This design provides the advantages of a sloped roof while maximizing headroom inside the building 's upper level and shortening what would otherwise be a tall roof . The name comes from the Medieval Latin word gamba , meaning horse 's hock or leg . The term gambrel is of American origin , the older , European name being a curb ( kerb , kirb ) roof . Europeans historically did not distinguish between a gambrel roof and a mansard roof but called both types a mansard . In the United States , various shapes of gambrel roofs are sometimes called Dutch gambrel or Dutch Colonial gambrel with bell-cast eaves , Swedish , German , English , French , or New England gambrel . The cross-section of a gambrel roof is similar to that of a mansard roof , but a gambrel has vertical gable ends instead of being hipped at the four corners of the building . A gambrel roof overhangs the fa\u00e7ade , whereas a mansard normally does not .",

Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/Crib_pier": "A crib pier is a type of pier built with the supporting columns made of 'cribs ' . Typically a crib is made from wood , but it could be made from any long cylindrical material . Pairs of logs are laid parallel , then others laid over them to make a square , and this continues upwards in a style of building similar to a log cabin 's construction . Each crib can be either empty or filled with a material such as rocks , gravel , concrete blocks , etc . This material can serve to provide additional stability in the event of high winds if the crib is very tall . Advantages of crib construction include its simplicity and strength . Logs need only be cut and notched for stability , then lain crosswise until a certain height is reached . As each layer of wood is only used as a compressive layer , the wood need not be strong . Since there are few load-bearing fasteners in the lower levels , reasonable strength is possible . Disadvantages include very heavy construction , relying on much more material than a bridge of more advanced design .",

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",
  "/wiki/Prairie_School": "Prairie School is a late 19th- and early 20th-century architectural style , most common in the Midwestern United States . The style is usually marked by horizontal lines , flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves , windows grouped in horizontal bands , integration with the landscape , solid construction , craftsmanship , and discipline in the use of ornament . Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide , flat , treeless expanses of America 's native prairie landscape . The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement , with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production . The term Prairie School was not actually used by practitioners of the style . Architect Marion Mahony , for example , preferred the phrase The Chicago Group . Its term was coined by H.

  "/wiki/Presbyterian": "Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism , which traces its origins to Britain , particularly Scotland . Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government , which is governed by representative assemblies of elders . A great number of Reformed churches are organized this way , but the word Presbyterian , when capitalized , is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Church of Scotland , as well as several English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War . Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God , the authority of the Scriptures , and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ . Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 , which created the Kingdom of Great Britain . In fact , most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection , and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America , mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants . The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the Reformed theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors , although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism . Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation ( elders ) ; a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making ( presbytery , synod and general assembly ) . The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Reformation of the 16th century , the example of John Calvin 's Republic of Geneva being particularly influential . Most Reformed churches that trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government . In the twentieth century , some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement , including the World Council of Churches . Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions , especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches .",

With an estimated population of 2,705,994 ( 2018 ) , it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States . Chicago is the county seat of Cook County , the second-most-populous county in the US , with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport . Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",
  "/wiki/Lake_Michigan": "Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America . It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume ( 1,180 cu mi ( 4,900 km3 ) ) and the third-largest by surface area ( 22,404 sq mi ( 58,030 km2 ) ) , after Lake Superior and Lake Huron ( and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia ) . To the east , its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the narrow Straits of Mackinac , giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart ; the two are technically a single lake . Lake Michigan is the only one of the Great Lakes located entirely within the territory of the United States . It is shared , from west to east , by the U.S. states of Wisconsin , Illinois , Indiana , and Michigan . Ports along its shores include Chicago ; Milwaukee ; Green Bay , Wisconsin ; Gary , Indiana ; and Muskegon , Michigan . The word Michigan originally referred to the lake itself , and is believed to come from the Ojibwe word michi-gami meaning great water .",

  "/wiki/Tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis ( TB ) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) bacteria . Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body . Most infections do not have symptoms , in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis . About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which , if left untreated , kills about half of those affected . The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing mucus , fever , night sweats , and weight loss . It was historically called consumption due to the weight loss . Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms . Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough , spit , speak , or sneeze . People with latent TB do not spread the disease . Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke . Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays , as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids . Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test ( TST ) or blood tests .",

  "/wiki/Antibiotic": "An antibiotic is a type of antimicrobial substance active against bacteria and is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections . Antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections . They may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria . A limited number of antibiotics also possess antiprotozoal activity . Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza ; drugs which inhibit viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals rather than antibiotics . Sometimes , the term antibiotic which means opposing life , based on Greek roots , ( \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9- ) anti : against and ( \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2- ) biotic : life , is broadly used to refer to any substance used against microbes , but in the usual medical usage , antibiotics ( such as penicillin ) are those produced naturally ( by one microorganism fighting another ) , whereas nonantibiotic antibacterials ( such as sulfonamides and antiseptics ) are fully synthetic . However , both classes have the same goal of killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms , and both are included in antimicrobial chemotherapy . Antibacterials include antiseptic drugs , antibacterial soaps , and chemical disinfectants , whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine and sometimes in livestock feed . Antibiotics have been used since ancient times . Many civilizations used topical application of mouldy bread , with many references to its beneficial effects arising from ancient Egypt , China , Serbia , Greece and Rome . The first person to directly document the use of moulds to treat infections was John Parkinson ( 1567-1650 ) . Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century .",

  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship , often referred to as a steamer , is a type of steam-powered vessel , typically ocean-faring and seaworthy , that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move ( turn ) propellers or paddlewheels . The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s ; however , there were exceptions that came before . Steamships usually use the prefix designations of PS for paddle steamer or SS for screw steamer ( using a propeller or screw ) . As paddle steamers became less common , SS is assumed by many to stand for steamship . Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as MV for motor vessel , so it is not correct to use SS for most modern vessels . As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns , new trade routes opened up . The steamship has been described as a major driver of the first wave of trade globalization ( 1870-1913 ) and contributor to an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history .",

  "/wiki/Northeaster": "A nor'easter ( also northeaster ; see below ) is a macro-scale extratropical cyclone in the western North Atlantic Ocean . The name derives from the direction of the winds that blow from the northeast . The original use of the term in North America is associated with storms that impact the upper north Atlantic coast of the United States and the Atlantic Provinces of Canada . Typically , such storms originate as a low-pressure area that forms within 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the shore between North Carolina and Massachusetts . The precipitation pattern is similar to that of other extratropical storms . Nor'easters are usually accompanied by very heavy rain or snow , and can cause severe coastal flooding , coastal erosion , hurricane-force winds , or blizzard conditions . Nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in New England and Atlantic Canada . They thrive on converging air masses - the cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the water - and are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greater . Nor'easters tend to develop most often and most powerfully between the months of October and April , although they can ( much less commonly ) develop during other parts of the year as well . The susceptible regions are generally impacted by nor'easters a few times each winter .",

  "/wiki/Iron_ore": "Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted . The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey , bright yellow , or deep purple to rusty red . The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite ( Fe3O4 , 72.4% Fe ) , hematite ( Fe2O3 , 69.9% Fe ) , goethite ( FeO ( OH ) , 62.9% Fe ) , limonite ( FeO ( OH ) \u00b7n ( H2O ) , 55% Fe ) or siderite ( FeCO3 , 48.2% Fe ) . Ores containing very high quantities of hematite or magnetite ( greater than about 60% iron ) are known as natural ore or direct shipping ore , meaning they can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces . Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron , which is one of the main raw materials to make steel - 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel . Indeed , it has been argued that iron ore is more integral to the global economy than any other commodity , except perhaps oil .",

  "/wiki/Lifeboat_(shipboard)": "A lifeboat or life raft is a small , rigid or inflatable boat carried for emergency evacuation in the event of a disaster aboard a ship . Lifeboat drills are required by law on larger commercial ships . Rafts ( liferafts ) are also used . In the military , a lifeboat may double as a whaleboat , dinghy , or gig . The ship 's tenders of cruise ships often double as lifeboats . Recreational sailors usually carry inflatable life rafts , though a few prefer small proactive lifeboats that are harder to sink and can be sailed to safety . Inflatable lifeboats may be equipped with auto-inflation ( carbon dioxide or nitrogen ) canisters or mechanical pumps . A quick release and pressure release mechanism is fitted on ships so that the canister or pump automatically inflates the lifeboat , and the lifeboat breaks free of the sinking vessel . Commercial aircraft are also required to carry auto-inflating life rafts in case of an emergency water landing ; offshore oil platforms also have liferafts . Ship-launched lifeboats are lowered from davits on a ship 's deck , and are hard to sink in normal circumstances . The cover serves as protection from sun , wind and rain , can be used to collect rainwater , and is normally made of a reflective or fluorescent material that is highly visible . Lifeboats have oars , flares and mirrors for signaling , first aid supplies , and food and water for several days ."
