The band incorporated elements of blues , jazz , and country music , and their live shows featured jam band-style improvisation and instrumentals . The group 's first two studio releases , The Allman Brothers Band ( 1969 ) and Idlewild South ( 1970 ) ( both released by Capricorn Records ) , stalled commercially , but their 1971 live release , At Fillmore East , represented an artistic and commercial breakthrough . The album features extended renderings of their songs In Memory of Elizabeth Reed and Whipping Post , and is considered among the best live albums ever made . Group leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year - on October 29 , 1971 , and the band dedicated Eat a Peach ( 1972 ) to his memory , a dual studio/live album that cemented the band 's popularity and featured Gregg Allman 's Melissa and Dickey Betts 's Blue Sky . Following the motorcycling death of bassist Berry Oakley exactly one year and 13 days later on November 11 , 1972 , the group recruited keyboardist Chuck Leavell and bassist Lamar Williams for 1973 's Brothers and Sisters . This album included Betts 's hit single Ramblin ' Man and instrumental Jessica . These tunes went on to become classic rock radio staples , and placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music . Internal turmoil overtook them soon after ; the group dissolved in 1976 , reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes , and dissolved again in 1982 . The band reformed once more in 1989 , releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily . A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts . The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist Oteil Burbridge and guitarists Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks ( the nephew of their original drummer ) and became renowned for their month-long string of shows at New York City 's Beacon Theatre each spring .",

  "/wiki/Chuck_Berry": "Charles Edward Anderson Berry ( October 18 , 1926 - March 18 , 2017 ) was an American singer and songwriter , and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music .

Goode ( 1958 ) . Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism , and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship , Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music . Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis , Missouri , Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School . While still a high school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory , where he was held from 1944 to 1947 . After his release , Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant . By early 1953 , influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker , Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio . His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters , who suggested he contact Leonard Chess , of Chess Records . With Chess , he recorded Maybellene - Berry 's adaptation of the country song Ida Red - which sold over a million copies , reaching number one on Billboard magazine 's rhythm and blues chart . By the end of the 1950s , Berry was an established star , with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career . He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub , Berry 's Club Bandstand . However , he was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act - he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines .",

  "/wiki/The_Byrds": "The Byrds /b\u025c\u02d0rdz/ were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles , California in 1964 . The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence , with frontman Roger McGuinn ( known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967 ) remaining the sole consistent member . Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like the Beatles , the Beach Boys , and the Rolling Stones for a short period in the mid-1960s , the Byrds are today considered by critics to be nearly as influential as those bands . Their signature blend of clear harmony singing and McGuinn 's jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar was absorbed into the vocabulary of rock and has continued to be influential . Initially , the band pioneered the musical genre of folk rock as a popular format in 1965 , by melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music on their debut album and the hit singles Mr. Tambourine Man and Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! . As the 1960s progressed , the band was influential in originating psychedelic rock and raga rock , with their song Eight Miles High and the albums Fifth Dimension ( 1966 ) , Younger Than Yesterday ( 1967 ) and The Notorious Byrd Brothers ( 1968 ) . They also played a pioneering role in the development of country rock , with the 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo representing their fullest immersion into the genre . The original five-piece lineup of the Byrds consisted of Jim McGuinn ( lead guitar , vocals ) , Gene Clark ( tambourine , vocals ) , David Crosby ( rhythm guitar , vocals ) , Chris Hillman ( bass guitar , vocals ) , and Michael Clarke ( drums ) . This version of the band was relatively short-lived ; by early 1966 , Clark had left due to problems associated with anxiety and his increasing isolation within the group .

He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music . Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz . Born in Alton , Illinois and raised in East St. Louis , Davis left to study at the Juilliard School in New York City , before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker 's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948 . Shortly after , he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records , which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz . In the early 1950s , Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction . After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955 , he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album 'Round About Midnight . It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers , key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s . During this period , he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans , such as the Spanish-influenced Sketches of Spain ( 1960 ) , and band recordings , such as Milestones ( 1958 ) and Kind of Blue ( 1959 ) . The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time , having sold over four million copies in the U.S. Davis made several line-up changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come ( 1961 ) , his 1961 Blackhawk concerts , and Seven Steps to Heaven ( 1963 ) , another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter , pianist Herbie Hancock , and drummer Tony Williams . After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964 , Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members , helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P ( 1965 ) and Miles Smiles ( 1967 ) , before transitioning into his electric period . During the 1970s , he experimented with rock , funk , African rhythms , emerging electronic music technology , and an ever-changing line-up of musicians , including keyboardist Joe Zawinul , drummer Al Foster , and guitarist John McLaughlin .",

He played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith , who interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager . Within months , Hendrix earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience : Hey Joe , Purple Haze , and The Wind Cries Mary . He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 , and his third and final studio album Electric Ladyland reached number one in the US in 1968 ; it was Hendrix 's most commercially successful release and his only number-one album .
