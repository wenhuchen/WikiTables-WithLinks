  "/wiki/Tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis ( TB ) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) bacteria . Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body . Most infections do not have symptoms , in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis . About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which , if left untreated , kills about half of those affected . The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing mucus , fever , night sweats , and weight loss . It was historically called consumption due to the weight loss . Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms . Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough , spit , speak , or sneeze . People with latent TB do not spread the disease . Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke . Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays , as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids . Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test ( TST ) or blood tests .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

The Great Lakes are the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth by total area , and second-largest by total volume , containing 21% of the world 's surface fresh water by volume . The total surface is 94,250 square miles ( 244,106 km2 ) , and the total volume ( measured at the low water datum ) is 5,439 cubic miles ( 22,671 km3 ) , slightly less than the volume of Lake Baikal ( 5,666 cu mi or 23,615 km3 , 22-23% of the world 's surface fresh water ) . Due to their sea-like characteristics ( rolling waves , sustained winds , strong currents , great depths , and distant horizons ) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as inland seas . Lake Superior is the second-largest lake in the world by area , and the largest freshwater lake by area . Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country . The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around 14,000 years ago , as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater .

The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers .

It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution . The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress , when Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general . The Post Office Department was created in 1792 with the passage of the Postal Service Act . It was elevated to a cabinet-level department in 1872 , and was transformed by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 into the United States Postal Service as an independent agency . The USPS , as of 2018 , has 497,157 career employees and 137,290 non-career employees . The Postal Service is legally obligated to serve all Americans , regardless of geography , at uniform price and quality . The Post Office has exclusive access to letter boxes marked U.S. Mail and personal letterboxes in the United States , but now has to compete against private package delivery services , such as United Parcel Service , FedEx , and Amazon . Since the early 1980s , many of the direct tax subsidies to the Post Office , with the exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters , have been reduced or eliminated , in addition to the advantages associated with a government-enforced monopoly on the delivery of first-class mail . Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume , after which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act which mandated that $ 5.5 billion per year be paid to fully prefund employee retirement health benefits , revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced declining mail volume , prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting costs to reduce its budget deficit .",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress .

  "/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent": "The Treaty of Ghent ( 8 Stat . 218 ) was the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812 between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . Both sides signed it on December 24 , 1814 , in the city of Ghent , United Netherlands ( now Belgium ) . The treaty restored relations between the two nations to status quo ante bellum , restoring the borders of the two countries to the lines before the war started in June 1812 . [ note 1 ] The treaty was approved by the British Parliament and signed into law by the Prince Regent ( the future King George IV ) on December 30 , 1814 . It took a month for news of the peace treaty to reach the United States during which American forces under Andrew Jackson won the Battle of New Orleans on January 8 , 1815 , and the British won the Second Battle of Fort Bowyer on February 12 , 1815 . The treaty was not fully in effect until it was ratified by the United States Senate , which occurred unanimously on February 17 , 1815 . That began more than two centuries of peaceful relations between the United States and Britain , despite a few tense moments , such as the Pig War in 1859 and Trent Affair in 1861 .",

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",
