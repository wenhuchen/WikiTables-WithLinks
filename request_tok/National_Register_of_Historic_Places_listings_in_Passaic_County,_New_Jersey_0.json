They saved their money until they could afford to build their own home in Haledon . In 1908 they finally moved into their new home , which was large enough to accommodate the entire family and included three additional rooms on the second floor that were rented for additional income . Pietro Botto and the couple 's daughters worked as weavers in that town 's Cedar Cliffs mills , while Maria did some outwork , cleaning and snipping imperfections from finished bolts of silk . In weekdays , she also served meals to boarders and working men in her dining room .

  "/wiki/Morris_Canal": "The Morris Canal ( 1829-1924 ) was a 107-mile ( 172-km ) common carrier coal canal across northern New Jersey in the United States that connected the two industrial canals at Easton , Pennsylvania , across the Delaware River from its western terminus at Phillipsburg , New Jersey , to New York Harbor and the New York City markets via its eastern terminals in Newark and on the Hudson River in Jersey City , New Jersey . ( The canal was sometimes called the Morris and Essex Canal , in error , due to confusion with the nearby and unrelated Morris and Essex Railroad . ) With a total elevation change of more than 900 feet ( 270 m ) , the canal was considered an ingenious technological marvel for its use of water-driven inclined planes , the first in the United States , to cross the northern New Jersey hills . [ a ] It was built primarily to move coal to industrializing eastern cities that had stripped their environs of wood . [ b ] Completed to Newark in 1831 , the canal was extended eastward to Jersey City between 1834 and 1836 . In 1839 , hot blast technology was married to blast furnaces fired entirely using anthracite , allowing the continuous high-volume production of plentiful anthracite pig iron . The Morris Canal eased the transportation of anthracite from Pennsylvania 's Lehigh Valley to northern New Jersey 's growing iron industry and other developing industries adopting steam power in New Jersey and the New York City area . It also carried minerals and iron ore westward to blast furnaces in western New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania ( famously , Allentown and Bethlehem ) until the development of Great Lakes iron ore caused the trade to decline . The Morris Canal remained in heavy use through the 1860s . But railroads had begun to eclipse canals in the United States , and in 1871 , it was leased to the Lehigh Valley Railroad . Like many enterprises that depended on anthracite , the canal 's revenues dried up with the rise of oil fuels and truck transport . It was taken over by the state of New Jersey in 1922 , and formally abandoned in 1924 ."
