  "/wiki/Structuration_theory": "The theory of structuration is a social theory of the creation and reproduction of social systems that is based in the analysis of both structure and agents ( see structure and agency ) , without giving primacy to either . Further , in structuration theory , neither micro- nor macro-focused analysis alone is sufficient . The theory was proposed by sociologist Anthony Giddens , most significantly in The Constitution of Society , which examines phenomenology , hermeneutics , and social practices at the inseparable intersection of structures and agents . Its proponents have adopted and expanded this balanced position . Though the theory has received much criticism , it remains a pillar of contemporary sociological theory .",
  "/wiki/Organizational_theory": "Organizational theory consists of many approaches to organizational analysis . Organizations are defined as social units of people that are structured and managed to meet a need , or to pursue collective goals . Theories of organizations include rational system perspective , division of labour , bureaucratic theory , and contingency theory . In a rational organization system , there are two significant parts : Specificity of Goals and Formalization . The division of labor is the specialization of individual labor roles , associated with increasing output and trade . Modernization theorist Frank Dobbin states modern institutions are transparently purposive and that we are in the midst of an evolutionary progression towards more efficient forms . Max Weber 's conception of bureaucracy is characterized by the presence of impersonal positions that are earned and not inherited , rule-governed decision-making , professionalism , chain of command , defined responsibility , and bounded authority . The contingency theory holds that an organization must try to maximize performance by minimizing the effects of varying environmental and internal constraints . Dwight Waldo noted in a review of field work in 1978 : Organization theory is characterized by vogues , heterogeneity , claims and counterclaims , and even greater differentiation in theory and practice have developed since then . Organization theory certainly can not be described as an orderly progression of ideas , or a unified body of knowledge in which each development builds carefully on and extends the one before it . Rather , developments in theory and prescriptions for practice show disagreement about the purposes and uses of a theory of organization , the issues to which it should address itself ( such as supervisory style and organizational culture ) , and the concepts and variables that should enter into such a theory .",

  "/wiki/Intelligent_design": "Intelligent design ( ID ) is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God , presented by its proponents as an evidence-based scientific theory about life 's origins . Proponents claim that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection . ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses , so it is not science . The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute , a Christian , politically conservative think tank based in the United States . [ n 1 ] Though the phrase intelligent design had featured previously in theological discussions of the argument from design , the first publication of the term intelligent design in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in Of Pandas and People , a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes . The term was substituted into drafts of the book , directly replacing references to creation science and creationism , after the 1987 United States Supreme Court 's Edwards v. Aguillard decision which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds . From the mid-1990s , the intelligent design movement ( IDM ) , supported by the Discovery Institute , advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula . This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III found that intelligent design was not science , that it can not uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents , and that the school district 's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations : irreducible complexity and specified complexity . These arguments assert that certain features ( biological and informational , respectively ) are too complex to be the result of natural processes . As a positive argument against evolution , ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts , a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God . [ n 2 ] ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features , as defined by ID , are evidence of design .",

  "/wiki/Financial_economist": "Financial economics is the branch of economics characterized by a concentration on monetary activities , in which money of one type or another is likely to appear on both sides of a trade . Its concern is thus the interrelation of financial variables , such as prices , interest rates and shares , as opposed to those concerning the real economy . It has two main areas of focus : asset pricing and corporate finance ; the first being the perspective of providers of capital , i.e . investors , and the second of users of capital . It thus provides the theoretical underpin for much of finance . The subject is concerned with the allocation and deployment of economic resources , both spatially and across time , in an uncertain environment . It therefore centers on decision making under uncertainty in the context of the financial markets , and the resultant economic and financial models and principles , and is concerned with deriving testable or policy implications from acceptable assumptions . It is built on the foundations of microeconomics and decision theory . Financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterise these relationships . Mathematical finance is related in that it will derive and extend the mathematical or numerical models suggested by financial economics . The emphasis there is mathematical consistency , as opposed to compatibility with economic theory . Financial economics has a primarily microeconomic focus , whereas monetary economics is primarily macroeconomic in nature .",

  "/wiki/S.C._Johnson_Graduate_School_of_Management": "The Johnson School traces its beginnings to the university 's founding in 1865 . University co-founder Ezra Cornell proposed a Department of Trade and Commerce for the new university , which was a radical departure from the day 's conventional notions about higher education , as this proposal was made sixteen years before Joseph Wharton endowed the nation 's first collegiate business school at the University of Pennsylvania . At a university faculty meeting on October 2 , 1868 , Cornell co-founder and first president Andrew Dickson White , suggested the creation of a professorship in bookkeeping in the context of a larger proposal : the creation of a commercial college . In the meantime , the Agriculture College continued to have a Department of Agricultural Economics and the Arts College continued to have a Department of Economics . Formal movements towards a business school began in 1914 , when faculty in the NYS College of Agriculture ( which today offers an undergraduate business major ) convened the first meeting of the Committee on a Commercial College . Led by economics professor Allyn Young , the committee recommended the creation of a two-year graduate course leading to the Master 's degree in both business and public administration . Young had been trained at Harvard University , and the influence on the committee 's discussion of its business school 's creation only six years prior was apparent , as the committee 's recommendations included instruction for graduate students only , selectivity in admissions , and integration into the larger university community . The idea of a business school took a backseat to World War I and its effects on the Cornell population . Following the Armistice of 1918 , third university president Jacob Gould Schurman called for the establishment of such a school , which he estimated would require $ 1 million of initial funding . However , financial difficulties surrounding the Great Depression would further delay its creation .",

  "/wiki/Dennis_Frank_Thompson": "Dennis Frank Thompson ( born 12 May 1940 , in Hamilton , Ohio ) is a political scientist and professor at Harvard University , where he founded the university-wide Center for Ethics and the Professions ( now the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics ) . Thompson is known for his pioneering work in the fields of both political ethics and democratic theory . According to a recent appraisal , he has become influential within the world of political theory by offering greater concrete political thought than Rawls and by showing an atypical grasp , for a political theorist , of the real political world . Thompson is a leading proponent of the institutional approach to political ethics , which gives less attention to individual vices ( such as greed and sexual misconduct ) and more to institutional ones ( such as abuse of power and neglect of accountability ) . His approach has stimulated new work on institutional corruption . Thompson 's proposal to establish an independent body to regulate congressional ethics has been widely endorsed , though not by many members of the United States Congress . However , in March 2008 , the U.S. House created a pared down version of such a body -- the Office of Congressional Ethics . Thompsons first book on democratic theory , The Democratic Citizen : Social Science and Democratic Theory in the 20th Century , published in 1970 , was one of the first to relate contemporary social science to theories of democracy . His much-cited 1996 book , Democracy and Disagreement , co-authored with Amy Gutmann , has been influential in promoting the idea of deliberative democracy , which calls for more reasoned discourse in public life . It is still stimulating discussion and controversy , and has led to the publication of an entire book devoted to its criticism and defense ( Deliberative Politics , edited by Stephen Macedo ) . Some critics object that deliberative democracy is biased in favor of political elites . Defenders argue that more and better political deliberation can help all citizens .",
