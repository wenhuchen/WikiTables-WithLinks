An international version of the network , now known as Fox Sports Racing , concurrently launched in Canada , the Caribbean and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico to replace the domestic feed , airing archived Speed programming and live simulcasts of motorsports events carried by Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2 in the United States that would be otherwise unavailable to international viewers . When it originally launched in 1995 as Speedvision , the network carried a lineup featuring programs profiling the automobile and motorsports industries ( including individual companies , vehicles and teams ) , how-to series , and coverage of various domestic and international racing series ( such as the Formula One World Championship , Rolex Sports Car Series , and the American Le Mans Series ) . After it was acquired by News Corporation in 2001 and relaunched as Speed Channel , the network 's programming became increasingly NASCAR-oriented ; prior to its shutdown in the U.S. , Speed 's lineup consisted mostly of automotive-themed reality shows , NASCAR-related programs ( including coverage of practice and qualifying sessions , and full coverage of the Camping World Truck Series ) , along with news programs focusing on motorsports . Most of Speed 's live event programming was carried over to Fox Sports 1 ( or sister network Fox Sports 2 ) , and is simulcast on the Speed network that remains available outside the U.S. Due to contractual changes associated with the relaunch , Fox was expected to temporarily distribute a version of Speed ( separate from the international version ) to fulfill contracts with providers that had not yet signed deals to carry Fox Sports 1 , airing a loop of the network 's past reality programming . Many of the programs once found on Speed can now be found in the United States on CBS Sports Network , MAVTV and Velocity ( such as Gearz , My Classic Car , Chop Cut Rebuild , and Dream Car Garage as well as live coverage of racing events ) , others not such as Speed Center .",

Under Viacom ownership , TNN began phasing out its existing , country-influenced programming , in favor of more off-network series , films , and sports entertainment programming targeted to a wider audience . It was renamed The National Network in September 2000 , coinciding with the premiere of WWF Raw on the channel . At this point , Viacom described TNN as being a general entertainment service , albeit one appealing to Middle America . In August 2003 , TNN relaunched as Spike TV , which targeted a young adult male audience . In June 2006 , Spike rebranded with a more explicit focus on the action genre .",
