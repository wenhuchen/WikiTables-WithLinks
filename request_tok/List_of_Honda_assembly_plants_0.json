It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China , with a population of over 11 million , the ninth most populous Chinese city , and one of the nine National Central Cities of China . The name Wuhan came from the city 's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang , Hankou and Hanyang , which are collectively known as the Three Towns of Wuhan ( \u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547 ) . It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain , on the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary , the Han River , and is known as Nine Provinces ' Thoroughfare ( \u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862 ) . Historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising , which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China . Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) government led by Wang Jingwei . The city later served as the wartime capital of China in 1937 for ten months during the Second Sino-Japanese War . Wuhan today is considered the political , economic , financial , commercial , cultural and educational center of Central China . It is a major transportation hub , with dozens of railways , roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities . Because of its key role in domestic transportation , Wuhan is sometimes referred to as the Chicago of China by foreign sources . The Golden Waterway of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary , the Han River , traverse the urban area and divides Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang , Hankou and Hanyang .

  "/wiki/Honda_Civic": "The Honda Civic ( Japanese : \u30db\u30f3\u30c0\u30fb\u30b7\u30d3\u30c3\u30af ) is a line of cars manufactured by Honda . Originally a subcompact , the Civic has gone through several generational changes , becoming both larger and more upscale , moving into the compact car segment . EPA guidelines for vehicle size class stipulate a car having combined passenger and cargo room of 110 to 119.9 cubic feet ( 3,110 to 3,400 L ) is considered a mid-size car , and as such the tenth generation Civic sedan is technically a small-end mid-size car , although it still competes in the compact class . The Civic coup\u00e9 is still considered a compact car . The Civic currently falls between the Honda City and Honda Accord . The first generation Civic was introduced in July 1972 as a two-door model , followed by a three-door hatchback that September . With an 1169 cc transverse engine and front-wheel drive like the British Mini , the car provided good interior space despite overall small dimensions . Initially gaining a reputation for being fuel-efficient , reliable and environmentally friendly , later iterations have become known for performance and sportiness , especially the Civic Type R , Civic VTi , Civic GTi and Civic SiR/Si . The Civic has been repeatedly rebadged for international markets , and served as the basis for the Honda CR-X , the Honda CR-X del Sol , the Concerto , the first generation Prelude , the Civic Shuttle ( later to become the Orthia ) and the CR-V . In Japan , as customers increasingly shifted to minivans and compact cars like the Fit , production of the non-hybrid Civic ended in August 2010 when it no longer complied with Japanese government dimension regulations in the width category . However , the Civic was reintroduced into the Japanese market with the launch of the tenth generation model in 2017 .",

It is related to the USA-spec Honda Odyssey but is not the same vehicle . One of the major differences from the previous generation JDM Honda Odyssey was that the rear doors were exchanged to sliding doors typically used on minivans , whereas the JDM Odyssey used conventional doors . The USA-spec Honda Odyssey , known in Japan as the Honda LaGreat , was too large for Japan , so the Elysion took many styling cues from the LaGreat and used them on a smaller vehicle . In June 2012 , the Elysion was introduced to the Chinese market . Production of the Elysion was ceased in October 2013 in Japan , but continued to be assembled and sold in China . Honda was inspired to name the vehicle the Elysion from the classical Greek word Elysium , or heaven . [ citation needed ]",

The Accord nameplate has been applied to a variety of vehicles worldwide , including coupes , station wagons , hatchbacks and a Honda Crosstour crossover . Since initiation , Honda has offered several different car body styles and versions of the Accord , and often vehicles marketed under the Accord nameplate concurrently in different regions differ quite substantially . It debuted in 1976 , as a compact hatchback , though this style only lasted through 1989 , as the lineup was expanded to include a sedan , coupe and wagon . By the sixth-generation Accord at the end of the 1990s , it evolved into an intermediate vehicle , with one basic platform but with different bodies and proportions to increase its competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets . For the eighth-generation Accord released for the North American market in 2007 , Honda had again chosen to move the model further upscale and increase its size . This pushed the Accord sedan from the upper limit of what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) defines as a mid-size car to just above the lower limit of a full-size car , with the coupe still rated as a mid-size car . In 2012 , the ninth-generation Accord sedan , with smaller exterior dimensions , was once again classified as a mid-size car at 119 cubic feet ( 3.4 m3 ) , falling just shy of the Large Car classification . However , the tenth-generation Accord sedan , with similar exterior dimensions , returned to full-size car status with its combined interior space of 123 cubic feet ( 3.5 m3 ) ; the coupe was discontinued in 2017 . In 1982 , the Accord became the first car from a Japanese manufacturer to be produced in the United States when production commenced in Marysville , Ohio at Honda 's Marysville Auto Plant . The Accord has achieved considerable success , especially in the United States , where it was the best-selling Japanese car for sixteen years ( 1982-97 ) , topping its class in sales in 1991 and 2001 , with around ten million vehicles sold . Numerous road tests , past and present , rate the Accord as one of the world 's most reliable vehicles .",
