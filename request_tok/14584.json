  "/wiki/Rome": "Rome ( Latin and Italian : Roma [ \u02c8ro\u02d0ma ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy ( named Comune di Roma Capitale ) . Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",

  "/wiki/Ruggiero_di_San_Severino": "Roger of San Severino ( died December 1221 ) was the Archbishop of Benevento from 1179 until his death . He was probably a younger brother of Count William of San Severino , the most powerful lord in the Cilento and a royal justiciar . He may also have been a cousin of Count Robert of Caserta . He was a monk at Montecassino before becoming bishop at a young age . His high aristocratic lineage and monastic vows were both unusual for bishops of southern Italy at the time . He was appointed archbishop of Benevento and cardinal-priest of Sant'Eusebio by Pope Alexander III . In June 1180 Roger and five of his twenty-two suffragans and two other bishops visited Montecassino , where they issued an indulgence for one year 's penance to visitors of the abbey and one year and forty days ' penance to visitors on Saint Benedict 's day . In 1182 , when Roger dedicated the abbey church of Montevergine , he was accompanied by nine of his suffragans . In 1199 Roger 's own canons brought charges against him before Pope Innocent III , who sent a cardinal and the archbishop of Naples to investigate . Among the charges was that Roger had encouraged the citizens of Benevento to destroy the castle ( castellum ) of a neighbouring baron with whom they were in dispute . Therefore , the canons alleged , Roger was a participant in , and master of , civil war .",

  "/wiki/External_cardinal": "In the category of the members of the College of Cardinals in the central Middle Ages ( 11th to 13th century ) , an external cardinal ( as opposed to a curial cardinal ) was a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church who did not reside in the Roman Curia , because of simultaneously being a bishop of the episcopal see other than suburbicarian , or abbot of an abbey situated outside Rome . In the wider sense , it may also concern cardinals who were appointed to the external episcopal sees and resigned their memberships in the College of Cardinals with this appointment . As well , it can concern cardinals who were generally curial cardinals , but for some time exercised the posts of administrators or prelates of the external churches . Today , the great majority of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries . Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope , their dignity is purely honorific . However , originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome , constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses ( called suburbicarian sees ) bordering the diocese of Rome ( cardinal-bishops ) , priests of the parochial churches of Rome ( cardinal-priests ) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome ( cardinal-deacons ) . Unlike today , the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses , parochial churches ( called tituli ) or deaconries to which they were attached . The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule , that cardinals - members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome - can not serve simultaneously in another , external church , which is now common practice .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_France": "The Kingdom of France ( French : Royaume de France ) was a medieval and early modern monarchy in Western Europe . It was among the most powerful states in Europe and a great power since the Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years ' War . It was also an early colonial power , with possessions around the world . France originated as West Francia ( Francia Occidentalis ) , the western half of the Carolingian Empire , with the Treaty of Verdun ( 843 ) . A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987 , when Hugh Capet was elected king and founded the Capetian dynasty . The territory remained known as Francia and its ruler as rex Francorum ( king of the Franks ) well into the High Middle Ages . The first king calling himself Roi de France ( King of France ) was Philip II , in 1190 . France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines - the Valois and Bourbon - until the monarchy was abolished in 1792 during the French Revolution . France in the Middle Ages was a de-centralised , feudal monarchy . In Brittany and Catalonia ( now a part of Spain ) the authority of the French king was barely felt . Lorraine and Provence were states of the Holy Roman Empire and not yet a part of France . Initially , West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates , but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father 's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture , which became codified in the Salic law .",

  "/wiki/Cardinal-nephew": "A cardinal-nephew ( Latin : cardinalis nepos ; Italian : cardinale nipote ; Spanish : valido de su t\u00edo ; French : prince de fortune ) was a cardinal elevated by a pope who was that cardinal 's relative . The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages , and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries . The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692 . The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice , when it appeared in the English language about 1669 . From the middle of the Avignon Papacy ( 1309-1377 ) until Pope Innocent XII 's anti-nepotism bull ( a papal charter ) , Romanum decet pontificem ( 1692 ) , a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule . Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals , and the nephew was the most common choice , although one of Alexander VI 's creations was his own son . The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries , tracking developments in the history of the papacy and the styles of individual Popes . From 1566 until 1692 , a cardinal-nephew held the curial office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State , known as the Cardinal Nephew , and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State increased and the temporal power of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries . The list of cardinal-nephews includes at least fifteen , and possibly as many as nineteen popes ( Gregory IX , Alexander IV , Adrian V , Gregory XI , Boniface IX , Innocent VII , Eugene IV , Paul II , Alexander VI , Pius III , Julius II , Leo X , Clement VII , Benedict XIII , and Pius VII ; perhaps also John XIX and Benedict IX , if they were really promoted cardinals ; as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII , if in fact they were related to their elevators ) ; one antipope ( John XXIII ) ; and two or three saints ( Charles Borromeo , Guarinus of Palestrina , and perhaps Anselm of Lucca , if he was really a cardinal ) ."
