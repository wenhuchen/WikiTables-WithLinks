When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s , teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist .

While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick , unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin , Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman ; he thus had to learn for himself that with great power there must also come great responsibility - a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian , the late Uncle Ben . Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series , the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man .

Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as anti-communist satire for its children 's supplement Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me , it was serialised weekly from January 1929 to May 1930 before being published in a collected volume by \u00c9ditions du Petit Vingti\u00e8me in 1930 . The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy , who are sent to the Soviet Union to report on the policies of Joseph Stalin 's Bolshevik government . Tintin 's intent to expose the regime 's secrets prompts agents from the Soviet secret police , the OGPU , to hunt him down with the intent to kill . Bolstered by publicity stunts , Land of the Soviets was a commercial success in Belgium , and also witnessed serialisation in France and Switzerland . Herg\u00e9 continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in the Congo , and the series became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition . Damage to the original plates prevented republication of the book for several decades , while Herg\u00e9 later expressed embarrassment at the crudeness of the work . As he began to redraw his earlier Adventures in second , colour versions from 1942 onward , he decided against doing so for Land of the Soviets ; it was the only completed Tintin story that Herg\u00e9 did not reproduce in colour . Growing demand among fans of the series resulted in the production of unauthorised copies of the book in the 1960s , with the first officially sanctioned republication appearing in 1969 , after which it was translated into several other languages , including English . Critical reception of the work has been largely negative , and several commentators on The Adventures of Tintin have described Land of the Soviets as one of Herg\u00e9 's weakest works .",
  "/wiki/Herge": "Georges Prosper Remi ( French : [ \u0281\u0259mi ] ; 22 May 1907 - 3 March 1983 ) , known by the pen name Herg\u00e9 ( /\u025b\u0259r\u02c8\u0292e\u026a/ ; French : [ \u025b\u0281\u0292e ] ) , was a Belgian cartoonist . He is best known for creating The Adventures of Tintin , the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century . He was also responsible for two other well-known series , Quick & Flupke ( 1930-1940 ) and The Adventures of Jo , Zette and Jocko ( 1936-1957 ) . His works were executed in his distinct ligne claire drawing style . Born to a lower-middle-class family in Etterbeek , Brussels , Herg\u00e9 began his career by contributing illustrations to Scouting magazines , developing his first comic series , The Adventures of Totor , for Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926 . Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle , he created The Adventures of Tintin in 1929 on the advice of its editor Norbert Wallez . Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy , the series ' early installments - Tintin in the Land of the Soviets , Tintin in the Congo , and Tintin in America - were designed as conservative propaganda for children . Domestically successful , after serialisation the stories were published in book form , with Herg\u00e9 continuing the series and also developing both the Quick & Flupke and Jo , Zette and Jocko series for Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle . Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren , from 1934 Herg\u00e9 placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories , resulting in increased realism from The Blue Lotus onward . Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940 , Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle was closed , but Herg\u00e9 continued his series in Le Soir , a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration . After the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944 , Le Soir was shut down and its staff - including Herg\u00e9 - accused of having been collaborators . An official investigation was launched , and while no charges were brought against Herg\u00e9 , in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator .",
  "/wiki/Adventures_of_Tintin": "The Adventures of Tintin ( French : Les Aventures de Tintin [ lez\u203fav\u0251\u0303ty\u0281 d\u0259 t\u025b\u0303t\u025b\u0303 ] ) is a series of 24 bande dessin\u00e9e albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi , who wrote under the pen name Herg\u00e9 . The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century . By 2007 , a century after Herg\u00e9 's birth in 1907 , Tintin had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies , and had been adapted for radio , television , theatre , and film . The series first appeared in French on 10 January 1929 , in Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me ( The Little Twentieth ) , a youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle ( The Twentieth Century ) . The success of the series saw the serialised strips published in Belgium 's leading newspaper Le Soir ( The Evening ) and spun into a successful Tintin magazine . In 1950 , Herg\u00e9 created Studios Herg\u00e9 , which produced the canonical versions of eleven Tintin albums . The series is set during a largely realistic 20th century . Its hero is Tintin , a courageous young Belgian reporter and adventurer . He is aided by his faithful dog Snowy ( Milou in the original French edition ) . Other protagonists include the brash and cynical Captain Haddock and the intelligent but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus ( French : Professeur Tournesol ) , as well as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson ( French : Dupont et Dupond ) and the opera diva Bianca Castafiore . The series has been admired for its clean , expressive drawings in Herg\u00e9 's signature ligne claire ( clear line ) style . Its well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres : swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy , action , mysteries , political thrillers , and science fiction .",

  "/wiki/List_of_Wildstorm_titles": "WildStorm started publishing comics in 1992 . Since then , they have published an increasing number of titles , both in the Wildstorm fictional universe and in various creator-owned titles . Under the most recent sub-imprint structure , all Cliffhanger and Homage titles were published under the Wildstorm Signature Series sub-imprint , all WildStorm properties were published under the Wildstorm Universe sub-imprint , and all licensed properties were published through the Wildstorm sub-imprint . However , in August 2006 , WildStorm dropped all sub-imprints in order to simplify the line for retailers and customers , consolidating their output under a single Wildstorm label ."
