A. Lawrence Lowell , who succeeded Eliot , further reformed the undergraduate curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard 's land holdings and physical campus . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II ; he began to liberalize admissions after the war . The university is organized into eleven principal academic units - ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study - with campuses throughout Greater Boston : its 209-acre ( 85 ha ) original undergraduate campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 miles ( 5 km ) northwest of Boston ; the business school and many athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston ; and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area .

  "/wiki/Banking": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit . Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets . Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries . Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities . In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity , banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords . Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world . In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties - notably , the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds - have played a central role over many centuries . The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank .",
  "/wiki/Finance": "Finance is the study of money and how it is used . Specifically , it deals with the questions of how an individual , company or government acquires the money needed - called capital in the company context - and how they then spend or invest that money . Finance is , correspondingly , often split into three areas : personal finance , corporate finance and public finance . At the same time , finance is about the overall system - i.e . the financial markets that allow the flow of money , via investments and other financial instruments , between and within these areas ; this flow is facilitated by the financial services sector . A major focus within finance is thus investment management - called money management for individuals , and asset management for institutions - and finance then includes the associated activities of securities trading , investment banking , financial engineering , and risk management . More abstractly , finance is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over space and time : i.e . it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today , based on risk and uncertainty of future outcomes , incorporating the time value of money ( determining the present value of these future values , discounting , requires a risk-appropriate discount rate ) . As an academic field , finance theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management , ( financial ) economics , accountancy and applied mathematics . Correspondingly , given its wide application , there are several related professional qualifications , that can lead to the field . As the debate to whether finance is an art or a science is still open , there have been recent efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance .",
