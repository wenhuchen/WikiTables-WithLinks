Brera houses the Brera Academy of Fine Arts and the Brera Art Gallery , which prominently contributed to the development of Brera as an artists ' neighborhood and a place of bohemian atmosphere , sometimes referred to as the milanese Montmartre . Both the Academy and the Gallery are located in Palazzo Brera , the main historical building of the area ; this same building also houses Milan 's botanical garden as well as an astronomical observatory and the Braidense National Library .
