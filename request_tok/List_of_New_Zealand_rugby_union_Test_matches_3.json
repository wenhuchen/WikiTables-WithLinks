  "/wiki/British_and_Irish_Lions": "The British & Irish Lions is a rugby union team selected from players eligible for any of the Home Nations - the national teams of England , Scotland , Wales and Ireland . The Lions are a Test side and generally select international players , but they can pick uncapped players available to any one of the four unions . The team currently tours every four years , with these rotating among Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . The most recent series , the 2017 series against New Zealand , was drawn 1-1 ( with one match drawn ) . From 1888 onwards , combined rugby sides from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland toured the Southern Hemisphere . The first tour was a commercial venture and was undertaken without official backing . The six subsequent visits enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities , before the 1910 South Africa tour , which was the first tour representative of the four Home Unions . In 1949 the four Home Unions formally created a Tours Committee and for the first time , every player of the 1950 Lions squad had played internationally before the tour . The 1950s tours saw high win rates in provincial games , but the Test series were typically lost or drawn . The winning series in 1971 ( New Zealand ) and 1974 ( South Africa ) changed this pattern . The last tour of the amateur age took place in 1993 . The Lions have also played occasional matches in the Northern Hemisphere either as one-off exhibitions or as part of a Southern Hemisphere tour .",

Its name comes from D\u00f9n \u00c8ideann , the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh , the capital of Scotland . The urban area of Dunedin lies on the central-eastern coast of Otago , surrounding the head of Otago Harbour , and the harbour and hills around Dunedin are the remnants of an extinct volcano . The city suburbs extend out into the surrounding valleys and hills , onto the isthmus of the Otago Peninsula , and along the shores of the Otago Harbour and the Pacific Ocean . Dunedin was the largest New Zealand city by territorial land area until superseded by Auckland with the formation of the Auckland Council in November 2010 . Archaeological evidence points to lengthy occupation of the area by M\u0101ori prior to the arrival of Europeans . The province and region of Otago takes its name from the Ngai Tahu village of Otakou at the mouth of the harbour , which became a whaling station in the 1830s . In 1848 a Scottish settlement was established by the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland . Between 1855 and 1900 many thousands of Scots emigrated to the incorporated city . Dunedin became wealthy during the Central Otago Gold Rush , beginning in the 1860s . In the mid-1860s , and between 1878 and 1881 , it was New Zealand 's largest urban area . The city population at 5 March 2013 was 120,246 .",

  "/wiki/South_Africa_national_rugby_union_team": "The South African national rugby union team , commonly known as the Springboks ( colloquially the Boks or Bokke , and Amabokoboko ) is the country 's national team governed by the South African Rugby Union . The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys with white shorts , and their emblem is the native antelope springbok . The team has been representing South Africa in international rugby union since 30 July 1891 , when they played their first test match against a British Isles touring team . Although South Africa was instrumental in the creation of the Rugby World Cup competition , the Springboks did not compete in the first two World Cups in 1987 and 1991 because of international anti-apartheid sporting boycotts . The team made its World Cup debut in 1995 , when the newly democratic South Africa hosted the tournament . The Springboks defeated the All Blacks 15-12 in the final , which is now remembered as one of the greatest moments in South Africa 's sporting history , and a watershed moment in the post-Apartheid nation-building process . South Africa regained the title as champions 12 years later , when they defeated England 15-6 in the 2007 final . As a result of the 2007 World Cup tournament the Springboks were promoted to first place in the IRB World Rankings , a position they held until July the following year when New Zealand regained the top spot . They were named 2008 World Team of the Year at the Laureus World Sports Awards . South Africa then won a third World Cup title in 2019 , defeating England 32-12 in the final .
