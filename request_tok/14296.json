Birmingham is commonly referred to as the second city of the United Kingdom . Located in the West Midlands county and region in England , approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Central London , Birmingham , as one of the United Kingdom 's major cities , is considered to be the social , cultural , financial , and commercial centre of both the East and West Midlands . Distinctively , Birmingham only has small rivers flowing through it , mainly the River Tame and its tributaries River Rea and River Cole - one of the closest main rivers is the Severn , approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of the city centre . Birmingham 's urban area is the second-largest in the United Kingdom , with its most recently estimated population in 2017 being 2,897,303 , and it also lies within the most populated English district . A market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew in the 18th-century Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham . The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which , under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain , was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz .",
