The results of both the men 's and ladies ' singles events were dominated by placements in the compulsory figures , which at the time were nominally worth 50% of the total score but in fact weighted more heavily than the free skating due to being judged using a wider range of marks . In the men 's event , Ondrej Nepela , the figures winner , took the gold in spite of placing only 4th in the free skating after falling on his triple loop jump . The free skating winner was Sergei Chetverukhin , who skated one of his best performances at this event to take the silver medal . Patrick P\u00e9ra , second in the figures , had a poor free skating in which he fell on a triple salchow jump early in his program and then made other mistakes . Nonetheless the weight given to figures allowed him to take the bronze medal ahead of John Misha Petkevich , Kenneth Shelley , and Toller Cranston , who all skated dynamic programs with at least one cleanly landed triple jump apiece . The effect of the figures was even more pronounced in the ladies ' competition , where gold medal winner Beatrix Schuba placed only 7th in the free skating , performing mostly single jumps . The free skating was won by Janet Lynn , who received a perfect mark of 6.0 despite falling on a flying sit spin . Lynn 's skating captivated the Japanese audience , especially when she got up smiling from her fall . Lynn took the bronze while Karen Magnussen , second in the free skating with a strong performance , took the silver . The third place skater in the free skating , Sonja Morgenstern , included a triple salchow in her program , which at this time was very rare for a female skater . She placed 6th overall .",

The women 's tournament was first held at the 1998 Winter Olympics . The Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes . However , the advent of the state-sponsored full-time amateur athlete of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur , as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage . The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students , soldiers , or working in a profession , but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis . In 1986 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) voted to allow professional athletes to compete in the Olympic Games starting in 1988 . The National Hockey League ( NHL ) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle of the NHL season , and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated . Eventually , NHL players were admitted starting in 1998 . However , the NHL again refused to release its players starting in 2018 , citing financial reasons . From 1924 to 1988 , the tournament started with a round-robin series of games and ended with the medal round . Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round .",

Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events . Women 's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts . After a poll was taken indicating that only nine countries would send a bobsled team , the organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue , so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program . Cold War politics forced the IOC to debate the participation of China and Taiwan . The United States supported Taiwan while the Soviet Union stood behind China . Given the fact that the 1960 Games were to be held in America , there was concern among IOC members that the United States would not allow China or any other Communist country to participate .

A year later , he began the construction of the first chalets and hotels in the hamlet of M\u00e9ribel . Three years later , the war would stop the development of the resort , but when it was over , development continued .

  "/wiki/1956_Winter_Olympics": "The 1956 Winter Olympics , officially known as the VII Olympic Winter Games ( French : Les VIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver ; Italian : VII Giochi olimpici invernali ) , was a multi-sport event held in Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy , from 26 January to 5 February 1956 . Cortina , which had originally been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics , beat out Montreal , Colorado Springs and Lake Placid for the right to host the 1956 Games . The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other . The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements , but the rest of the costs for the Games had to be privately financed . Consequently , the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding . Thirty-two nations - the largest number of countries participating in the Winter Olympics until then - competed in the four sports and twenty-four events . Austrian Toni Sailer became the first person to sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics . The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games . Logistically , the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events . To remedy this , the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered . Politics did not affect the 1956 Winter Games - unlike the Summer Games in Melbourne , Australia later in the year which many nations boycotted after the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution , and the Suez War . The Cortina Olympics were the first Winter Olympics televised to a multi-national audience .",
