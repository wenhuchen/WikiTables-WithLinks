As in the other two books , the setting is the post-apocalyptic empire of Toromon , confined by a surrounding Barrier of highly-radioactive land , and inhabited by mutant/evolved forest people ( some of whom are telepaths ) and devolved neanderthals , as well as normal humans . The events of the book focus on a claimed war . Soldiers are told repeatedly we have an enemy behind the barrier and placed in coffin-like modules to be teleported into enemy territory to do battle . However , it turns out that the matter transporter or teleportation system has never worked , and the war is a hoax . The soldiers are wired into a computer prior to their teleportation experience but remain in their coffins . They hallucinate battles , with their experiences generated and coordinated by the computer . The pre-determined fatalities are killed by an enemy energy weapon within the communal reality , as the survivors remember it , but in reality are electrocuted and burned within their coffins . In some respects , this foreshadows the 1999 film The Matrix . However , Toromon does have a real enemy of sorts , on another plane of existence , and at the end of the book there is a cosmic conflict which leads to this entity being prevented from conducting further malicious experiments on Toromon .

As the name might suggest , they resemble mixed-media novels . In Japanese terminology , a distinction is often made between visual novels ( abbreviated NVL , derived from novel ) , which consist predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements , and adventure games ( abbreviated AVG , or ADV derived from adventure ) , a form of adventure game which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay . This distinction is normally lost outside Japan , where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as visual novels by international fans . Visual novels and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan , where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006 . Visual novels are often produced for video game consoles , and the more popular games have occasionally been ported to such systems . The more famous visual novels are also often adapted into the light novel , manga or anime formats . The market for visual novels outside of East Asia is small , though a number of anime based on visual novels are popular among anime fans in the Western world .",

The Lambda Literary Foundation states that its mission is to celebrate LGBT literature and provide resources for writers , readers , booksellers , publishers , and librarians - the whole literary community . The awards were instituted in 1988 . The program has grown from 14 awards in early years to 22 awards today . Early categories such as HIV/AIDS literature were dropped as the prominence of the AIDS crisis within the gay community waned , and categories for bisexual and transgender literature were added as the community became more inclusive . In both the bisexual and transgender categories , one or two awards may be presented annually ; if the number of submissions in a given year warrants , then separate awards for fiction and non-fiction are presented , while a smaller number of submissions results in a single award . In addition to the primary literary awards , the Lambda Literary Foundation also presents a number of special awards . The Pioneer Award is presented as a lifetime achievement award to a distinguished figure in the history of LGBT literature ; the Bridge Builder Award is presented to a person , regardless of sexuality , who has been a prominent ally and advocate of the LGBT community ; and the Trustee Award is presented to a writer who has made a considerable contribution to a wider awareness and understanding of the lives of LGBT people . Beginning in 2011 , the Lambda Literary Awards also took over the Jim Duggins Outstanding Mid-Career Novelists ' Prize , formerly presented by the Saints and Sinners Literary Festival .
