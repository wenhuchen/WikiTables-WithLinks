She is Phrygia 's only known goddess , and was probably its national deity . Her Phrygian cult was adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Asia Minor and spread to mainland Greece and its more distant western colonies around the 6th century BC . In Greece , Cybele met with a mixed reception . She was partially assimilated to aspects of the Earth-goddess Gaia , her possibly Minoan equivalent Rhea , and the harvest-mother goddess Demeter . Some city-states , notably Athens , evoked her as a protector , but her most celebrated Greek rites and processions show her as an essentially foreign , exotic mystery-goddess who arrives in a lion-drawn chariot to the accompaniment of wild music , wine , and a disorderly , ecstatic following . Uniquely in Greek religion , she had a eunuch mendicant priesthood . Many of her Greek cults included rites to a divine Phrygian castrate shepherd-consort Attis , who was probably a Greek invention . In Greece , Cybele is associated with mountains , town and city walls , fertile nature , and wild animals , especially lions . In Rome , Cybele was known as Magna Mater ( Great Mother ) . The Roman state adopted and developed a particular form of her cult after the Sibylline oracle recommended her conscription as a key religious ally in Rome 's second war against Carthage . Roman mythographers reinvented her as a Trojan goddess , and thus an ancestral goddess of the Roman people by way of the Trojan prince Aeneas .",
