  "/wiki/Film_producer": "A film producer is a person who oversees film production . Either employed by a production company or working independently , producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production , such as selecting the script ; coordinating writing , directing , and editing ; and arranging financing . During the discovery stage , the producer finds and selects promising material for development . Then , unless the film is based on an existing script , the producer has to hire a screenwriter and oversee the development of the script . Once a script is completed , the producer will lead a pitch to secure the financial backing ( a green light ) to allow production to begin . The producer also supervises the pre-production , production , and post-production stages of filmmaking . One of the most important tasks is to hire the director and other key crew members . Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production , the producer typically manages the logistics and business operations , though some directors also produce their own films . The producer is tasked with making sure the film is delivered on time and within budget , and has the final say on creative decisions . Finally , the producer will oversee the marketing and distribution . For various reasons , producers can not always supervise all of the production . In this case , the main producer or executive producer may hire and delegate work to associate producers , assistant producers , line producers or unit production managers .",

  "/wiki/The_Bahamas": "The Bahamas ( /b\u0259\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0m\u0259z/ ( listen ) ) , known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas , is a country within the Lucayan Archipelago in the West Indies . It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on .

  "/wiki/Auxiliary_Bishop": "An auxiliary bishop is a bishop assigned to assist the diocesan bishop in meeting the pastoral and administrative needs of the diocese . Auxiliary bishops can also be titular bishops of sees that no longer exist . In the Catholic Church , auxiliary bishops exist in both the Latin Church and in the Eastern Catholic Churches . The particular duties of an auxiliary bishop are given by the diocesan bishop and can vary widely depending on the auxiliary bishop , the ordinary , and the needs of the diocese . In a larger archdiocese , they might be in assigned to serve a portion of the archdiocese ( sometimes called deaneries , regions , or vicariates ) or to serve a particular population such as immigrants or those of a particular heritage or language . Canon law requires that the diocesan bishop appoint each auxiliary bishop as vicar general or episcopal vicar of the diocese . In Eastern Orthodox Churches , auxiliary bishops are also called vicarian bishops or simply vicar-bishops . In the Serbian Orthodox Church , the office of auxiliary ( vicar ) bishop is entrusted to titular bishops , who are assigned with assisting diocesan bishops in various aspects of diocesan administration . The Greek word protosyncellus defines an auxiliary bishop who has been elevated to the dignity of vicarian of another titular bishop , and who is assigned to assist and act on behalf of his episcopal authority over the jurisdiction of the episcopal see . For example , Teodosije \u0160ibali\u0107 ( titular Bishop of Lipljan ) was appointed auxiliary bishop to the Eparchy of Ra\u0161ka and Prizren in 2004 .",

The title normally occurs only in Western Christian churches , such as the Latin Church of the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion . Among the Eastern churches , the Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Kerala uses this title and remains an exception . The title for the equivalent officer in the Eastern churches is syncellus and protosyncellus . The term is used by many religious orders of men in a similar manner , designating the authority in the Order after its Superior General .",

  "/wiki/Autism": "Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication , and by restricted and repetitive behavior . Parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child 's life . These signs often develop gradually , though some children with autism experience worsening in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace . Autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections , such as rubella , toxins including valproic acid , alcohol , cocaine , pesticides , lead , and air pollution , fetal growth restriction , and autoimmune diseases . Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes ; for example , the vaccine hypothesis , which has been disproven . Autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize ; how this occurs is not well understood . The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) , combines autism and less severe forms of the condition , including Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ( PDD-NOS ) into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Early behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self-care , social , and communication skills . Although there is no known cure , there have been cases of children who recovered . Not many autistic adults are able to live independently , though some are successful . An autistic culture has developed , with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured .",
