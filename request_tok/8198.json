The game was instrumental in forcing the expansion of the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship , thus allowing for at-large bids and the inclusion of more than one team per conference . That Maryland team , with six future NBA draft picks , is considered by many to be the greatest team not to have participated in the NCAA tournament .",
