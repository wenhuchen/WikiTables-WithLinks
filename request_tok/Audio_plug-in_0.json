  "/wiki/GPLv3": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/Mac_OS_X": "macOS ( /\u02ccm\u00e6ko\u028a\u02c8\u025bs/ ; previously Mac OS X and later OS X ) is a series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001 . It is the primary operating system for Apple 's Mac computers . Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server . The initial version , Mac OS X Server 1.0 , was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5 .",
  "/wiki/Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/Linux": "Linux ( /\u02c8l\u026an\u0259ks/ ( listen ) LIN-\u0259ks ) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds . Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",
  "/wiki/Audio_Units": "Audio Units ( AU ) are a system-level plug-in architecture provided by Core Audio in Apple 's macOS and iOS operating systems . Audio Units are a set of application programming interface ( API ) services provided by the operating system to generate , process , receive , or otherwise manipulate streams of audio in near-real-time with minimal latency . It may be thought of as Apple 's architectural equivalent to another popular plug-in format , Steinberg 's Virtual Studio Technology ( VST ) . Because of the many similarities between Audio Units and VST , several commercial and free wrapping technologies are available ( e.g . Symbiosis and FXpansion VST-AU Adapter ) . Celemony Software and PreSonus have also developed the Audio Random Access ( ARA ) extension , which works for both AU and VST , allowing greater integration between the plug-ins and DAW software .",

  "/wiki/LADSPA": "LADSPA is an acronym for Linux Audio Developer 's Simple Plugin API . It is an application programming interface ( API ) standard for handling audio filters and audio signal processing effects , licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) . It was originally designed for Linux through consensus on the Linux Audio Developers Mailing List , but works on a variety of other platforms . It is used in many free audio software projects and there is a wide range of LADSPA plug-ins available . LADSPA exists primarily as a header file written in the programming language C. There are many audio plugin standards and most major modern software synthesizers and sound editors support a variety . The best known standard is probably Steinberg Cubase 's Virtual Studio Technology . LADSPA is unusual in that it attempts to provide only the Greatest Common Divisor of other standards . This means that its scope is limited , but it is simple and plugins written using it are easy to embed in many other programs . The standard has changed little with time , so compatibility problems are rare . DSSI extends LADSPA to cover instrument plugins . LV2 is a successor , based on LADSPA and DSSI , but permitting easy extensibility , allowing custom user interfaces , MIDI messages , and custom extensions .",
  "/wiki/LGPL": "The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) . The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components . However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License . The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components .",

The original BSD license was used for its namesake , the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , a Unix-like operating system . The original version has since been revised , and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses . BSD is both a license and a class of license ( generally referred to as BSD-like ) . The modified BSD license ( in wide use today ) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix . The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format , or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format . The BSD license ( unlike some other licenses ) does not require that source code be distributed at all .",
