  "/wiki/Plymouth": "Plymouth ( /\u02c8pl\u026am\u0259\u03b8/ ( listen ) ) is a port city situated on the south coast of Devon , England , approximately 37 miles ( 60 km ) south-west of Exeter and 190 miles ( 310 km ) west-south-west of London . Enclosing the city are the mouths of the river Plym and river Tamar , which are naturally incorporated into Plymouth Sound to form a boundary with Cornwall . Plymouth 's early history extends to the Bronze Age when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten . This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire , until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton founded in the ninth century , now called Plymouth . In 1620 , the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony , the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America . During the English Civil War , the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646 . Throughout the Industrial Revolution , Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port , handling imports and passengers from the Americas , and exporting local minerals ( tin , copper , lime , china clay and arsenic ) . The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town . In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns , viz. , the county borough of Plymouth , the county borough of Devonport , and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough . The combined town took the name of Plymouth which , in 1928 , achieved city status . The city 's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II , an act known as the Plymouth Blitz . After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967 .",

It derives its name from the old toll bridge ( adjacent to a naval saw mill ) across the creek between Eldad Hill and Molesworth Road , at one time the principal link between Plymouth and Devonport . The creek to the east of the bridge was filled in with material from the quarries at Cattedown and Oreston during the late 1890s and the ground created became a municipal park , Victoria Park , which was officially opened in 1903 . The remainder of the creek to the west of Millbridge , up to Stonehouse Bridge and Pool , was filled in and by 1972 the whole area had been developed as rugby pitches .

  "/wiki/North_Prospect": "North Prospect , previously officially named and still colloquially known as Swilly , was the name given to the first council estate built in Plymouth during the 1920s , primarily to accommodate officers settling back in Britain following the devastation of the First World War . The housing act of 1919 promised Homes for Heroes and an improvement on the overcrowded and inadequate living conditions that existed in early twentieth century Britain . Swilly was Plymouths response to this Act . Swilly House had been at the centre of a prosperous country estate . Much of the former mansion was transferred from Swilly , being reconstructed at a site known as Woodtown on the edge of Dartmoor . The original word may have derived from the Anglo-Saxon word meaning farmland , but also it may have a Celtic derivation associated to water ( refer to the Irish Lough Swilly and River Swilly ) as the earliest reference in Plymouth to Swilly creek in 1578 pre-dates the subsequent farm . Before the Second World War much of the locality of what is now North Prospect and the western edge of Beacon Park was known as Swilly . Swilly Post Office was at the corner of South Down Road and West Down Road . Swilly Hospital ( later renamed Scott Hospital after Robert Falcon Scott , who lived at the nearby Outland House and was later leader of ill-fated Antarctic Expedition in 1912 ) was first a sanatorium and later an isolation hospital and was situated at the heart of the estate ( the junction of Swilly Road , renamed North Prospect Road , and Beacon Park ) . Not far from here ( at 142 Swilly Road ) the first bombs of the Blitz fell . For a time , Ron Goodwin , whose orchestral compositions include 633 Squadron , lived at Swilly Crescent which , having been later renamed North Prospect Crescent , is now known as Goodwin Crescent . The council estate , designed with plenty of open space and trees , was prosperous up until the 1950s when the area began to get a reputation due to the economic and social problems of its residents .",

It is believed that a church must have been present in Whitchurch as early as the 11th century , and that it was most likely built from the white elvan [ citation needed ] that can be found at Roborough Down only a few miles away . This may be the derivation of the name of the village ( White-church ) , though many other English villages bearing the same name are considered to be thus named simply because their churches were either built of stone , or were whitewashed . The main church currently standing in Whitchurch - St. Andrew - is for the most part a 15th-century building made from granite as well as elvan .

The railway is now closed , but the Plym Valley Railway has reopened a section of it . Yelverton is well known for Roborough Rock - a prominent mass of stone close to the Plymouth road on the fringe of nearby Roborough Down , near the southern end of the airfield . It gave its name to the Rock Hotel , built as a farm during the Elizabethan period , but converted in the 1850s to cater for growing tourism in the area . The area to the south and west of the roundabout at the centre of the village was settled in late Victorian and Edwardian times , with many grand and opulent villas . An area developed at about the same time on an odd shaped piece of land to the south of the Tavistock road is known as Leg o ' Mutton Corner . At the beginning of the Second World War , an airfield ( RAF Harrowbeer ) was constructed at adjacent Harrowbeer as a fighter station for the air defence of Devonport Dockyard and the Western Approaches . A 19th century terrace of houses , now mostly converted into shops , had to have its upper storey removed to provide an easier approach . One tall building which was not altered was St. Paul 's Church , but the tower was hit by a plane , resulting in a warning light being fitted . The layout of the runways is still very clear and although they are substantially grassed over , the many earth and brick protective bunkers built to protect the fighters from attack on the ground are all still in place .

  "/wiki/Two_Bridges,_Devon": "Two Bridges is an isolated location on the river West Dart in the heart of Dartmoor National Park in Devon , England . It is situated around 2.5 km ( 1.6 mi ) north east of Princetown at the intersection of the two roads that cross Dartmoor : one is the old turnpike road which was built across Dartmoor in the late 18th century ( now known as the B3212 ) ; the other is the B3357 . A map dated 1765 suggests the origin of the name , for in those days the road crossed both the West Dart and the River Cowsic , just upstream from the point where they meet , and required two separate bridges . By 1891 , these had disappeared and there was just a single bridge , further downstream , over the West Dart . Today , however , there are again two bridges on the site , because a more modern structure has been added alongside its earlier predecessor . Visitors often mistakenly assume that these are the same two bridges that gave the name to the site . In the 18th century , Two Bridges was best known for its potato market . The site was no doubt chosen because it is in a central location , and easily accessible [ citation needed ] . Some small quarries in the vicinity show that there was also light industry in the area . Those who met and worked in this remote spot were fed and lodged at the Saracen 's Head . It was built in 1794 as a coaching inn , and still stands there today , although it is now known as the Two Bridges Hotel . It continues to be a popular meeting point for tourists and walkers ."
