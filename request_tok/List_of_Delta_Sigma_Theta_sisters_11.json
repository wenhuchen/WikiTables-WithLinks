  "/wiki/Voting_rights": "Suffrage , political franchise , or simply franchise is the right to vote in public , political elections ( although the term is sometimes used for any right to vote ) . In some languages , and occasionally in English , the right to vote is called active suffrage , as distinct from passive suffrage , which is the right to stand for election . The combination of active and passive suffrage is sometimes called full suffrage . Suffrage is often conceived in terms of elections for representatives . However , suffrage applies equally to referenda and initiatives . Suffrage describes not only the legal right to vote , but also the practical question of whether a question will be put to a vote . The utility of suffrage is reduced when important questions are decided unilaterally without extensive , conscientious , full disclosure and public review . In most democracies , eligible voters can vote in elections of representatives . Voting on issues by referendum may also be available . For example , in Switzerland this is permitted at all levels of government . In the United States , some states such as California and Washington have exercised their shared sovereignty to offer citizens the opportunity to write , propose , and vote on referendums and initiatives ; other states and the federal government have not .

Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) . A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master 's degree en route to the doctoral degree . Sometimes this status is also colloquially known as PhD ABD , meaning All But Dissertation .",

  "/wiki/Writer": "A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate ideas . Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels , short stories , poetry , plays , screenplays , and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public . Writers ' texts are published across a range of media . Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well , often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society . The term writer is also used elsewhere in the arts - such as songwriter - but as a standalone writer normally refers to the creation of written language . Some writers work from an oral tradition . Writers can produce material across a number of genres , fictional or non-fictional . Other writers use multiple media - for example , graphics or illustration - to enhance the communication of their ideas . Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers , whose skills create understandable , interpretive documents of a practical or scientific nature . Some writers may use images ( drawing , painting , graphics ) or multimedia to augment their writing . In rare instances , creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words . As well as producing their own written works , writers often write on how they write ( that is , the process they use ) ; why they write ( that is , their motivation ) ; and also comment on the work of other writers ( criticism ) .",
  "/wiki/Women's_Rights": "Women 's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls worldwide , and which formed the basis for the women 's rights movement in the 19th century and feminist movement during the 20th century . In some countries , these rights are institutionalized or supported by law , local custom , and behavior , whereas in others they are ignored and suppressed . They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls , in favor of men and boys . Issues commonly associated with notions of women 's rights include the right to bodily integrity and autonomy ; to be free from sexual violence ; to vote ; to hold public office ; to enter into legal contracts ; to have equal rights in family law ; to work ; to fair wages or equal pay ; to have reproductive rights ; to own property ; to education .",
  "/wiki/Activism": "Activism consists of efforts to promote , impede , direct , or intervene in social , political , economic , or environmental reform with the desire to make changes in society . Forms of activism range from mandate building in the community ( including writing letters to newspapers ) , petitioning elected officials , running or contributing to a political campaign , preferential patronage ( or boycott ) of businesses , and demonstrative forms of activism like rallies , street marches , strikes , sit-ins , or hunger strikes . Activism may be performed on a day-to-day basis in a wide variety of ways , including through the creation of art ( artivism ) , computer hacking ( hacktivism ) , or simply in how one chooses to spend their money ( economic activism ) . For example , the refusal to buy clothes or other merchandise from a company as a protest against the exploitation of workers by that company could be considered an expression of activism . However , the most highly visible and impactful activism often comes in the form of collective action , in which numerous individuals coordinate an act of protest together in order to make a bigger impact . Collective action that is purposeful , organized , and sustained over a period of time becomes known as a social movement . Historically , activists have used literature , including pamphlets , tracts , and books to disseminate or propagate their messages and attempt to persuade their readers of the justice of their cause . Research has now begun to explore how contemporary activist groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action combining politics with technology .",
