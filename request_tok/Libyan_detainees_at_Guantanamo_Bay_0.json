  "/wiki/Tablighi_Jamaat": "Tablighi Jamaat literally the Outreach Society or the Society for Spreading Faith , is a non-political global missionary movement that focuses on urging Muslims to return to practising Islam as practiced during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad , and particularly in matters of ritual , dress , and personal behavior . The organisation is estimated to have between 150 million to 250 million adherents ( the majority living in South Asia ) , and a presence in somewhere between 180 and 200 countries . It has been called one of the most influential religious movements in 20th century Islam . The movement was founded in 1927 by Muhammad Ilyas al-Kandhlawi in Mewat India in accordance to the teachings and practices that take place in The Prophet 's Mosque and Ashabus Suffah Tabligh . Its stated primary aim is spiritual reformation of Islam by reaching out to Muslims across social and economic spectra and working at the grassroots level , to bring them in line with the group 's understanding of Islam . The teachings of Tabligh Jamaat are expressed in Six Principles ( Kalimah ( Declaration of faith ) , Salah ( Prayer ) , Ilm-o-zikr ( Knowledge ) , Ikraam-e-Muslim ( Respect of Muslim ) , Ikhlas-e-Niyyat ( Sincerity of intention ) , Dawat-o-Tableegh ( Proselytizaton ) ) . Tablighi Jamaat believes that Muslims are in a constant state of spiritual Jihad in the sense of fight against evil , the weapon of choice is Dawah ( proselytization ) and that battles are won or lost in the hearts of men . Tablighi Jamaat began as an offshoot of the Deobandi movement , and a response to perceived deteriorating moral values and a supposed negligence of aspects of Islam . It expanded from a local to a national to an international movement . Tablighi Jamaat denies any affiliation in politics and fiqh ( jurisprudence ) , focusing instead on the Quran and Hadith , and states that it rejects violence as a means for evangelism , ( although some members have become involved in politics in Pakistan ) .Tablighi Jamaat has claimed to avoid electronic media and in favor of personal communication for proselytising , although prominent Tablighi personalities such as Tariq Jameel are featured on an extensive range of Internet videos and often appear on TV . Tablighi Jamaat attracted significant public and media attention when it announced plans for the largest mosque in Europe to be built in London .",

  "/wiki/2011_Libyan_civil_war": "The First Libyan Civil War was an armed conflict in 2011 in the North African country of Libya fought between forces loyal to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and those seeking to oust his government . It erupted with the Libyan Revolution , also known as the 17 February Revolution . The war was preceded by protests in Zawiya on 8 August 2009 and finally ignited by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday , 15 February 2011 , which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the crowd . The protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country , with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body , the National Transitional Council . The United Nations Security Council passed an initial resolution on 26 February , freezing the assets of Gaddafi and his inner circle and restricting their travel , and referred the matter to the International Criminal Court for investigation . In early March , Gaddafi 's forces rallied , pushed eastwards and re-took several coastal cities before reaching Benghazi . A further UN resolution authorised member states to establish and enforce a no-fly zone over Libya , and to use all necessary measures to prevent attacks on civilians , which turned into a bombing campaign by the forces of NATO against military installations and civilian infrastructure of Libya . The Gaddafi government then announced a ceasefire , but fighting and bombing continued . Throughout the conflict , rebels rejected government offers of a ceasefire and efforts by the African Union to end the fighting because the plans set forth did not include the removal of Gaddafi . In August , rebel forces launched an offensive on the government-held coast of Libya , backed by a wide-reaching NATO bombing campaign , taking back territory lost months before and ultimately capturing the capital city of Tripoli , while Gaddafi evaded capture and loyalists engaged in a rearguard campaign . On 16 September 2011 , the National Transitional Council was recognised by the United Nations as the legal representative of Libya , replacing the Gaddafi government . Muammar Gaddafi evaded capture until 20 October 2011 , when he was captured and killed in Sirte .",

He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism but later ruled according to his own Third International Theory . Born near Sirte , Italian Libya , to a poor Bedouin family , Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha , later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi . Within the military , he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed Senussi monarchy of Idris in a 1969 coup . Having taken power , Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his Revolutionary Command Council . Ruling by decree , he deported Libya 's Italian and Jewish populations and ejected its Western military bases . Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments - particularly Gamal Abdel Nasser 's Egypt - he unsuccessfully advocated pan-Arab political union . An Islamic modernist , he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and promoted Islamic socialism . He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military , fund foreign revolutionaries , and implement social programs emphasizing house-building , healthcare and education projects . In 1973 , he initiated a Popular Revolution with the formation of Basic People 's Congresses , presented as a system of direct democracy , but retained personal control over major decisions .

  "/wiki/Enemy_combatant": "Enemy combatant is a person who , either lawfully or unlawfully , engages in hostilities for the other side in an armed conflict . Usually enemy combatants are members of the armed forces of the state with which another state is at war . In the case of a civil war or an insurrection state may be replaced by the more general term party to the conflict ( as described in the 1949 Geneva Conventions Article 3 ) . After the September 11 attacks , the term enemy combatant was used by the George W. Bush administration to include an alleged member of al-Qaeda or the Taliban being held in detention by the U.S. government . In this sense , enemy combatant actually refers to persons the United States regards as unlawful combatants , a category of persons who do not qualify for prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Conventions . However , unlike unlawful combatants who qualify for some protections under the Fourth Geneva Convention , enemy combatants , under the Bush administration , were not covered by the Geneva Convention . Thus , the term enemy combatant has to be read in context to determine whether it means any combatant belonging to an enemy state or non-state actor , whether lawful or unlawful , or if it means an alleged member of al Qaeda or of the Taliban being detained as an unlawful combatant by the United States . [ citation needed ] In the United States on March 13 , 2009 , the Obama administration announced its abandonment of the Bush administration 's use of the term enemy combatant .",
