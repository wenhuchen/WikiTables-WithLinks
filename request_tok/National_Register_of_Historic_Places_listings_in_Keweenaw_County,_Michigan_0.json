  "/wiki/Multiple_Property_Submission": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",

  "/wiki/Copper_mine": "Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores . The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes . Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source , local environmental regulations , and other factors . As in all mining operations , the ore must usually be beneficiated ( concentrated ) . The processing techniques depend on the nature of the ore . If the ore is primarily sulfide copper minerals ( such as chalcopyrite ) , the ore is crushed and ground to liberate the valuable minerals from the waste ( 'gangue ' ) minerals . It is then concentrated using mineral flotation . The concentrate is typically then sold to distant smelters , although some large mines have smelters located nearby . Such colocation of mines and smelters was more typical in the 19th and early 20th centuries , when smaller smelters could be economic . The sulfide concentrates are typically smelted in such furnaces as the Outokumpu or Inco flash furnace or the ISASMELT furnace to produce matte , which must be converted and refined to produce anode copper . Finally , the final refining process is electrolysis . For economic and environmental reasons , many of the byproducts of extraction are reclaimed .",

  "/wiki/State_park": "State parks are parks or other protected areas managed at the sub-national level within those nations which use state as a political subdivision . State parks are typically established by a state to preserve a location on account of its natural beauty , historic interest , or recreational potential . There are state parks under the administration of the government of each U.S. state , some of the Mexican states , and in Brazil . The term is also used in the Australian state of Victoria . The equivalent term used in Canada , Argentina , South Africa and Belgium , is provincial park . Similar systems of local government maintained parks exist in other countries , but the terminology varies . State parks are thus similar to national parks , but under state rather than federal administration . Similarly , local government entities below state level may maintain parks , e.g. , regional parks or county parks . In general , state parks are smaller than national parks , with a few exceptions such as the Adirondack Park in New York and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California .",

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

  "/wiki/Manitou_Island_(Lake_Superior)": "Manitou Island is a small island in Lake Superior , off the northeastern tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula in the U.S. state of Michigan . It is part of Grant Township , in Keweenaw County . Located approximately three miles from the mainland , it encompasses around 1,000 acres ( 4.0 km2 ) . Manitou has seen limited impact from human activity , due to its remote location and the often-treacherous waters caused by a strong current at the peninsulas tip . It is mostly forested , with scattered bogs and an inland lake known as Perch Lake . Dense underbrush can make travel around the island rather difficult , though a few unimproved trails do exist . The Keweenaw Land Trust protects 93 acres ( 0.38 km2 ) of the island as the Manitou Island Light Station Preserve .",
