As of 2016 , Ottawa had a city population of 934,243 and a metropolitan population of 1,323,783 making it the fourth-largest city and the fifth-largest CMA in Canada . In June 2019 , the City of Ottawa estimated it had surpassed a population of a million . Founded in 1826 as Bytown , and incorporated as Ottawa in 1855 , the city has evolved into the political centre of Canada . Its original boundaries were expanded through numerous annexations and were ultimately replaced by a new city incorporation and amalgamation in 2001 which significantly increased its land area . The city name Ottawa was chosen in reference to the Ottawa River , the name of which is derived from the Algonquin Odawa , meaning to trade .

  "/wiki/Stanley_Cup": "The Stanley Cup ( French : La Coupe Stanley ) is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) playoff winner . It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise in North America , and the International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) considers it to be one of the most important championships available to the sport . The trophy was commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup and is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , the Governor General of Canada who donated it as an award to Canada 's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club . The entire Stanley family supported the sport , the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal Hockey Club , and winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , professional ice hockey organizations National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup . It was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 . There are actually three Stanley Cups : the original bowl of the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the authenticated Presentation Cup , and the spelling-corrected Permanent Cup on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame . While the NHL has maintained control over the trophy itself and its associated trademarks ; the NHL does not actually own the trophy but uses it by agreement with the two Canadian trustees of the cup . The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup , although there has been dispute as to whether the league has the right to own trademarks associated with a trophy that it does not own .

Appropriation could be enacted by putting an unowned resource to active use ( as with using it to produce a product ) , joining it with previously acquired property or by marking it as owned ( as with livestock branding ) . Proponents [ who ? ] of intellectual property hold that ideas can also be homesteaded by originally creating a virtual or tangible representation of them . Others argue that since tangible manifestations of a single idea will be present in many places , including within the minds of people , this precludes their being owned in most or all cases .

  "/wiki/Agriculture": "Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock . Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities . The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago . After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago , nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago . Pigs , sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago . Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world . Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output , though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first . Modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased yields , while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage . Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat , but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage . Environmental issues include contributions to global warming , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and growth hormones in industrial meat production . Genetically modified organisms are widely used , although some are banned in certain countries .

Bunkers can also be used as protection from tornadoes . Trench bunkers are small concrete structures , partly dug into the ground . Many artillery installations , especially for coastal artillery , have historically been protected by extensive bunker systems . Typical industrial bunkers include mining sites , food storage areas , dumps for materials , data storage , and sometimes living quarters . When a house is purpose-built with a bunker , the normal location is a reinforced below-ground bathroom with fibre-reinforced plastic shells . Bunkers deflect the blast wave from nearby explosions to prevent ear and internal injuries to people sheltering in the bunker . Nuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes , and block radiation . A bunker 's door must be at least as strong as the walls . In bunkers inhabited for prolonged periods , large amounts of ventilation or air conditioning must be provided .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_warfare": "Nuclear warfare ( sometimes atomic warfare or thermonuclear warfare ) is a military conflict or political strategy in which nuclear weaponry is used to inflict damage on the enemy . Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction ; in contrast to conventional warfare , nuclear warfare can produce destruction in a much shorter time and can have a long-lasting radiological warfare result . A major nuclear exchange would have long-term effects , primarily from the fallout released , and could also lead to a nuclear winter that could last for decades , centuries , or even millennia after the initial attack . Some analysts dismiss the nuclear winter hypothesis , and calculate that even with nuclear weapon stockpiles at Cold War highs , although there would be billions of casualties , billions more rural people would nevertheless survive . However , others have argued that secondary effects of a nuclear holocaust , such as nuclear famine and societal collapse , would cause almost every human on Earth to starve to death . So far , two nuclear weapons have been used in the course of warfare , both by the United States near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , a uranium gun-type device ( code name Little Boy ) was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima . Three days later , on August 9 , a plutonium implosion-type device ( code name Fat Man ) was detonated over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These two bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 120,000 people . After World War II , nuclear weapons were also developed by the Soviet Union ( 1949 ) , the United Kingdom ( 1952 ) , France ( 1960 ) , and the People 's Republic of China ( 1964 ) , which contributed to the state of conflict and extreme tension that became known as the Cold War .

By 1857 , he had become premier under the colony 's unstable political system . In 1864 , when no party proved capable of governing for long , Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival , George Brown , that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform . Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences , which resulted in the British North America Act , 1867 and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867 . Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation , and served 19 years ; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer . In 1873 , he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway . However , he was re-elected in 1878 , continuing until he died in office in 1891 .

The Gothic Revival was imported to Canada from Britain and the United States in the early 19th century , and rose to become the most popular style for major projects throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States , only falling out of style in the 1930s . The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded . Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious , civic , and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings . In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars , most notably Alan Gowans , embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation 's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism . While largely abandoned in the modernist period , several postmodern architects have embraced Canada 's neo-Gothic past .",
  "/wiki/Eclecticism": "Eclecticism is a conceptual approach that does not hold rigidly to a single paradigm or set of assumptions , but instead draws upon multiple theories , styles , or ideas to gain complementary insights into a subject , or applies different theories in particular cases . However , this is often without conventions or rules dictating how or which theories were combined . It can sometimes seem inelegant or lacking in simplicity , and eclectics are sometimes criticized for lack of consistency in their thinking . It is , however , common in many fields of study . For example , most psychologists accept certain aspects of behaviorism , but do not attempt to use the theory to explain all aspects of human behavior .

  "/wiki/Normal_school": "A normal school is an institution created to train high school graduates to be teachers by educating them in the norms of pedagogy and curriculum . Most such schools , where they still exist , are now denominated teacher-training colleges or teachers ' colleges and may be organized as part of a comprehensive university . Normal schools in the United States and Canada trained teachers for primary schools , while in continental Europe , the equivalent colleges educated teachers for primary , secondary and tertiary schools . In 1685 , St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle , founder of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools , founded what is generally considered the first normal school , the \u00c9cole Normale , in Reims , Champagne , France . The term normal herein refers to the goal of these institutions to instill and reinforce particular norms within students . Norms included historical behavioral norms of the time , as well as norms that reinforced targeted societal values , ideologies and dominant narratives in the form of curriculum . The first public normal school in the United States was founded in Concord , Vermont , by Samuel Read Hall in 1823 to train teachers . In 1839 , the first state-supported normal school was established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on the northeast corner of the historic Lexington Battle Green ; it evolved into Framingham State University . The first modern teacher training school in China was established by educator Sheng Xuanhuai in 1895 as the normal school of the Nanyang Public School ( now Shanghai Jiao Tong University ) in Shanghai during the Qing dynasty . Many comprehensive public or state-supported universities , such as the University of California , Los Angeles in the United States and Beijing Normal University in China , were established and operated as normal schools before expanding their faculties and organizing as research universities . Some of these universities , particularly in Asia , retain the word Normal in their name to recognize their historical purpose . In Canada , most normal schools were eventually assimilated into a university as its faculty of education , offering a one or two-year Bachelor of Education degree .",

He served as the tenth prime minister of Canada in 1921-1926 , 1926-1930 and 1935-1948 . He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War ( 1939-1945 ) when he mobilized Canadian money , supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining morale on the home front . A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office , he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history . Trained in law and social work , he was keenly interested in the human condition ( as a boy , his motto was Help those that can not help themselves ) , and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state . King acceded to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1919 . Taking the helm of a party bitterly torn apart during the First World War , he reconciled factions , unifying the Liberal Party and leading it to victory in the 1921 election . His party was out of office during the harshest days of the Great Depression in Canada , 1930-35 ; he returned when the economy was on an upswing . He personally handled complex relations with the Prairie Provinces , while his top aides Ernest Lapointe and Louis St. Laurent skillfully met the demands of French Canadians . During the Second World War , he carefully avoided the battles over conscription , patriotism and ethnicity that had divided Canada so deeply in the First World War . Though few major policy innovations took place during his premiership , he was able to synthesize and pass a number of measures that had reached a level of broad national support .

The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice .

Originally , the word was used to refer to an ancient Roman public building , where courts were held , as well as serving other official and public functions . It usually had the door at one end and a slightly raised platform and an apse at the other , where the magistrate or other officials were seated . The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town , usually adjacent to the main forum . Subsequently , the basilica was not built near a forum but adjacent to a palace and was known as a palace basilica . Secondly , as the Roman Empire adopted Christianity , the major church buildings were typically constructed with this basic architectural plan and thus it became popular throughout Europe . It continues to be used in an architectural sense to describe rectangular buildings with a central nave and aisles , and usually a raised platform at the opposite end from the door . In Europe and the Americas the basilica remained the most common architectural style for churches of all Christian denominations , though this building plan has become less dominant in new buildings since the latter 20th century . Thirdly , the term refers to an official designation of a certain kind of church in the Roman Catholic Church : a large and important place of worship that has been given special ceremonial rights by the Pope , whatever its architectural plan . These are divided into : major basilicas - numbering only four , all of which are ancient churches located within Rome - and minor basilicas - found all around the world and which , as of 2019 [ update ] , number 1,810 . These major and minor basilicas are commonly simply referred to as basilicas . Some Catholic basilicas are Catholic pilgrimage sites , receiving tens of millions of visitors per year .",
