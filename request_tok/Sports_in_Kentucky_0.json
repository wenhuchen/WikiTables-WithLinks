  "/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_women's_basketball": "The Kentucky Wildcats women 's basketball team represent the University of Kentucky in the Southeastern Conference , which has historically been the most dominant conference in women 's basketball . However , despite reaching national rankings as high as # 4 , the team has never reached the national championship semifinals ( Final Four ) . Through the end of the 2009-10 season , the team 's all-time varsity record ( excluding non-varsity seasons prior to 1974 ) was 603-455 , the team had won the SEC Women 's Basketball Tournament ( 1982 ) , and appeared in the NCAA Tournament fourteen times with a tournament record of 7-7 . The first University of Kentucky women 's basketball team was organized in 1902 , and competed for the first time on Feb. 21 , 1903 . However , in 1924 , despite a perfect 10-0 season , the University Senate passed a bill to abolish women 's basketball in part because , according to state politicians , basketball had proven to be a strenuous sport for boys and therefore was too strenuous for girls . After 50 years , women 's basketball was granted varsity status in 1974 , and most of the official records maintained by the university only reflect games since that time . The team , coached by Sue Feamster , was given the nickname Lady Kats , which continued to be used until May 1995 . Led by UK all-time leading scorer Valerie Still , Patty Jo Hedges , and Lea Wise , the Lady Kats won the SEC Tournament in 1982 . The following year , the same trio led the team to a # 4 ranking in the country , the highest in the team 's history . The team is currently coached by Matthew Mitchell .",
