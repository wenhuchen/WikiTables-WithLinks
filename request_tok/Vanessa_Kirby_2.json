  "/wiki/Ghosts_(play)": "Ghosts ( Danish : Gengangere ) is a play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen . It was written in 1881 and first staged in 1882 in Chicago , Illinois , in a production by a Danish company on tour . Like many of Ibsen 's plays , Ghosts is a scathing commentary on 19th-century morality . Because of its subject matter , which includes religion , venereal disease , incest , and euthanasia , it immediately generated strong controversy and negative criticism . Since then the play has fared better , and is considered a great play that historically holds a position of immense importance . Theater critic Maurice Valency wrote in 1963 , From the standpoint of modern tragedy Ghosts strikes off in a new direction . Regular tragedy dealt mainly with the unhappy consequences of breaking the moral code . Ghosts , on the contrary , deals with the consequences of not breaking it .",

As one of the founders of modernism in theatre , Ibsen is often referred to as the father of realism and one of the most influential playwrights of his time . His major works include Brand , Peer Gynt , An Enemy of the People , Emperor and Galilean , A Doll 's House , Hedda Gabler , Ghosts , The Wild Duck , When We Dead Awaken , Rosmersholm , and The Master Builder . He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare , and A Doll 's House was the world 's most performed play in 2006 . Ibsen 's early poetic and cinematic play Peer Gynt has strong surreal elements . After Peer Gynt Ibsen abandoned verse and wrote in realistic prose . Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era , when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety . Ibsen 's later work examined the realities that lay behind the facades , revealing much that was disquieting to a number of his contemporaries . He had a critical eye and conducted a free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality . In many critics ' estimates The Wild Duck and Rosmersholm are vying with each other as rivals for the top place among Ibsen 's works ; Ibsen himself regarded Emperor and Galilean as his masterpiece . Ibsen is often ranked as one of the most distinguished playwrights in the European tradition . Richard Hornby describes him as a profound poetic dramatist - the best since Shakespeare .",

He is often called England 's national poet and the Bard of Avon ( or simply the Bard ) . [ b ] His extant works , including collaborations , consist of some 39 plays , [ c ] 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",

His career as a playwright produced four classics , and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics . Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg , Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre . Chekhov practiced as a medical doctor throughout most of his literary career : Medicine is my lawful wife , he once said , and literature is my mistress . Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of The Seagull in 1896 , but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Konstantin Stanislavski 's Moscow Art Theatre , which subsequently also produced Chekhov 's Uncle Vanya and premiered his last two plays , Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard . These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences , because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a theatre of mood and a submerged life in the text . Chekhov had at first written stories to earn money , but as his artistic ambition grew , he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story . He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers , insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions , not to answer them .",

  "/wiki/Edward_II_(play)": "The Troublesome Reign and Lamentable Death of Edward the Second , King of England , with the Tragical Fall of Proud Mortimer , known as Edward II , is a Renaissance or Early Modern period play written by Christopher Marlowe . It is one of the earliest English history plays , and focusses on the relationship between King Edward II of England and Piers Gaveston , and Edward 's murder on the orders of Roger Mortimer . Marlowe found most of his material for this play in the third volume of Raphael Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) . Frederick S. Boas believes that out of all the rich material provided by Holinshed Marlowe was drawn to the comparatively unattractive reign of Edward II due to the relationship between the King and Gaveston . Boas elaborates , Homosexual affection . has ( as has been seen ) a special attraction for Marlowe . Jove and Ganymede in Dido , Henry III and his 'minions ' in The Massacre , Neptune and Leander in Hero and Leander , and all akin , although drawn to a slighter scale , to Edward and Gaveston . Boas also notes the existence of a number of parallels between Edward II and The Massacre at Paris , asserting that it is scarcely too much to say that scenes xi-xxi of The Massacre are something in the nature of a preliminary sketch for Edward II . Marlowe stayed close to the account but embellished it with the character of Lightborn ( or Lucifer ) as Edward 's assassin .",

Marlowe was the foremost Elizabethan tragedian of his day . He greatly influenced William Shakespeare , who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe 's mysterious early death . Marlowe 's plays are known for the use of blank verse and their overreaching protagonists . Some scholars believe that a warrant was issued for Marlowe 's arrest on 18 May 1593 . No reason was given for it , though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy - a manuscript believed to have been written by Marlowe was said to contain vile heretical conceipts . On 20 May , he was brought to the court to attend upon the Privy Council for questioning . There is no record of their having met that day , and his being commanded to attend upon them each day thereafter , until licensed to the contrary .

She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre . Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills , intelligence , and beauty . She became a femme fatale figure in plays and literature over the years , usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure . Isabella arrived in England at the age of 12 during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions . Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite , Piers Gaveston , but the queen supported Edward during these early years , forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power . After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312 , however , Edward later turned to a new favourite , Hugh Despenser the Younger , and attempted to take revenge on the barons , resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England . Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser and by 1325 her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point . Travelling to France on a diplomatic mission , Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer , and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family . The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326 , moving rapidly across England . The King 's forces deserted him . Isabella deposed Edward , becoming regent on behalf of her son , Edward III .",
