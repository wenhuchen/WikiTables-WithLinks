  "/wiki/Frank_Fetter": "Frank Albert Fetter ( /\u02c8f\u025bt\u0259r/ ; March 8 , 1863 - March 21 , 1949 ) was an American economist of the Austrian School . Fetter 's treatise , The Principles of Economics , contributed to an increased American interest in the Austrian School , including the theories of Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk , Friedrich von Wieser , Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek . Fetter notably debated Alfred Marshall , presenting a theoretical reassessment of land as capital . Fetter 's arguments have been credited with prompting mainstream economists to abandon the Georgist idea that land is a unique factor of production and hence that there is any special need for a special theory of ground rent . A proponent of the subjective theory of value , Fetter emphasized the importance of time preference and rebuffed Irving Fisher for abandoning the pure time preference theory of interest that Fisher had earlier espoused in his 1907 book , The Rate of Interest .",
  "/wiki/Austrian_School": "The Austrian School is a heterodox school of economic thought that is based on methodological individualism - the concept that social phenomena result exclusively from the motivations and actions of individuals . The Austrian School originated in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of Carl Menger , Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk , Friedrich von Wieser and others . It was methodologically opposed to the Prussian Historical School ( in a dispute known as Methodenstreit ) . Current-day economists working in this tradition are located in many different countries , but their work is still referred to as Austrian economics . Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the subjective theory of value , marginalism in price theory and the formulation of the economic calculation problem , each of which has become an accepted part of mainstream economics . Since the mid-20th century , mainstream economists have been critical of the modern day Austrian School and consider its rejection of mathematical modelling , econometrics and macroeconomic analysis to be outside mainstream economics , or heterodox . Although the Austrian School has been considered heterodox since the late 1930s , it attracted renewed interest in the 1970s after Friedrich Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences .",
  "/wiki/Economics": "Economics ( /\u025bk\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026aks , i\u02d0k\u0259-/ ) is the social science that studies how individuals , organizations , and societies manage the scarce resources under their control for the satisfaction of their needs and desires . Economics focuses on the behavior and interactions of economic agents and how those interactions work particularly and as a whole . Microeconomics analyzes individual agents , industries and markets , their interactions , and the outcomes of their interactions . Individual agents may include , for example , households , firms , buyers , and sellers . Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy ( meaning aggregated production , consumption , saving , and investment ) and issues affecting it , including unemployment of resources ( labor , capital , and land ) , inflation , economic growth , and the public policies that address these issues ( monetary , fiscal , and other policies ) . See glossary of economics . Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics , describing what is , and normative economics , advocating what ought to be ; between economic theory and applied economics ; between rational and behavioural economics ; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics . Economic analysis can be applied throughout society , in real estate , business , finance , health care , and government . Economic analysis is sometimes also applied to such diverse subjects as crime , education , the family , law , politics , religion , social institutions , war , science , and the environment .",

It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington , D.C. and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800 . The term White House is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers . The residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the neoclassical style . Hoban modelled the building on Leinster House in Dublin , a building which today houses the Oireachtas , the Irish legislature . Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white . When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801 , he ( with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe ) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage . In 1814 , during the War of 1812 , the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington , destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior . Reconstruction began almost immediately , and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817 . Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829 . Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself , President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901 . Eight years later in 1909 , President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office , which was eventually moved as the section was expanded .",
