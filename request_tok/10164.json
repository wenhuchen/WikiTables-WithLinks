  "/wiki/Sheyenne_River": "The Sheyenne River is one of the major tributaries of the Red River of the North , meandering 591 miles ( 951 km ) across eastern North Dakota , United States . The river begins about 15 miles ( 24 km ) north of McClusky , and flows generally eastward before turning south near McVille . The southerly flow of the river continues through Griggs and Barnes counties before it turns in a northeastward direction near Lisbon . The river forms the 27-mile long Lake Ashtabula behind the Baldhill Dam north of Valley City , which was constructed in 1951 for flood control by the US Army Corps of Engineers . The Sheyenne is classified as a perch river , as its banks are higher than the surrounding ground , formed as natural levees in flooding centuries ago . When floodwaters break through the banks , they spread in a wide area . From Lisbon , the river crosses the Sheyenne National Grassland and enters Cass County near the city of Kindred . This stretch of the river is designated a National Wild and Scenic Riverway . From Kindred , the river flows north-northeastward through the fertile plains of the Red River Valley . The character of the river changes as it leaves the sandy grasslands and picks up the fertile clay soil of the Red River Valley . Previously , the river posed a flooding hazard to cities such as West Fargo and Harwood , where it joins the Red River of the North , which flows north to Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba . Thanks to a diversion canal completed near Horace and extending past West Fargo , these major Sheyenne River cities fared well in the 1997 Red River flood .",
