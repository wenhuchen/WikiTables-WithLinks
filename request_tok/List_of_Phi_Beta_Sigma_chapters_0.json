Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country , Washington was named after George Washington , the first president of the United States and a Founding Father . As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States . Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city 's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek . Washington 's metropolitan area , the country 's sixth largest ( including parts of Maryland , Virginia and West Virginia ) , had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents .",

The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines Petersburg ( along with the city of Colonial Heights ) with Dinwiddie County for statistical purposes . It is located on the Appomattox River ( a tributary of the longer larger James River flowing east to meet the southern mouth of the Chesapeake Bay at the Hampton Roads harbor and the Atlantic Ocean ) . The city is just 21 miles ( 34 km ) south of the historic commonwealth ( state ) capital city of Richmond . The city 's unique industrial past and its location as a transportation hub combined to create wealth for Virginia and the Middle Atlantic and Upper South regions of the nation . Early in the colonial era of the 18th century , Petersburg was the final destination on the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System because of its location on the Appomattox River with its connection to the James River to the east at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line ( the head of navigation of rivers on the U.S. East Coast ) and the tying in with the James River shipping traffic was a strategic place for transportation and commercial activities . It connected commerce as far inland as Farmville , Virginia at the foothills of the Blue Ridge and the Appalachian Mountains chain , to shipping further east into the Chesapeake Bay and North Atlantic Ocean . For similar reasons , 17th century era Fort Henry was built at the order of the Virginia House of Burgesses at Petersburg in 1645 to protect the river traffic . As railroads were being constructed and extended in the state in the 1830s and 1840s , Petersburg was developed as a major transfer point for both north-south and east-west competitors . The Petersburg Railroad , authorized in 1830 , three years after the first American railway , the B. & O. in Baltimore , by the state legislatures of both Virginia and North Carolina to the south , which opened in 1833 .
