  "/wiki/Greek_isles": "Greece has many islands , with estimates ranging from somewhere around 1,200 to 6,000 , depending on the minimum size to take into account . The number of inhabited islands is variously cited as between 166 and 227 . The largest Greek island by area is Crete , located at the southern edge of the Aegean Sea . The second largest island is Euboea , which is separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide Euripus Strait , and is administered as part of the Central Greece region . After the third and fourth largest Greek Islands , Lesbos and Rhodes , the rest of the islands are two-thirds of the area of Rhodes , or smaller . The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters : the Argo-Saronic Islands in the Saronic gulf near Athens ; the Cyclades , a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea ; the North Aegean islands , a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey ; the Dodecanese , another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey ; the Sporades , a small tight group off the coast of Euboea ; and the Ionian Islands , chiefly located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea . Crete with its surrounding islets and Euboea are traditionally excluded from this grouping . This article excludes the Peloponnese , which has technically been an island since the construction of the Corinth Canal in 1893 , but is rarely considered to be an island .",
  "/wiki/Statue": "A statue is a free-standing sculpture in which the realistic , full-length figures of persons or animals or non-representational forms are carved in a durable material such as wood , metal or stone . Typical statues are life-sized or close to life-size ; a sculpture that represents persons or animals in full figure but that is small enough to lift and carry is a statuette or figurine , whilst one more than twice life-size is a colossal statue . Statues have been produced in many cultures from prehistory to the present ; the oldest-known statue dating to about 30,000 years ago . Statues represent many different people and animals , real and mythical . Many statues are placed in public places as public art .

It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana . Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea , south of the Italian Peninsula , from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina . Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3,329 m ( 10,922 ft ) high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate . The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , and the House of Habsburg . It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand , a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification , and a plebiscite .

The word isthmus comes from the Ancient Greek word for neck and refers to the narrowness of the land . The Isthmus was known in the ancient world as the landmark separating the Peloponnese from mainland Greece . In the first century AD the geographer Strabo noted a stele on the Isthmus of Corinth , which bore two inscriptions .

To the west of the Isthmus is the Gulf of Corinth , to the east the Saronic Gulf . Since 1893 the Corinth Canal has run through the 6.3 km wide isthmus , effectively making the Peloponnese an island .

Above the site is a peak sanctuary , a sub-Minoan survival . Prinias developed at a similar time frame with Lato and Polyrrhenia as an Archaic Period settlement , colonised by Greeks from the mainland . The site contains vestiges of the first stone buildings since the fall of the Mycenaean kingdoms . Temple A , dated to around 625 BCE , is the earliest known Greek temple decorated with sculpture . Although its plan follows the Mycenaean model , the building had a flat roof and three massive piers on the fa\u00e7ade . The most remarkable surviving detail is a limestone lintel bearing two monumental statues of goddesses , seated facing each other . The figures , whose identification is disputed , each wear a long skirt and a cape , reminiscent of the so-called Lady of Auxerre . Below the figures is an orientalizing frieze representing three panthers on each side ; the motif is typical for North Syria . Temple B is known for its Daedalic sculpture , which consists of a statue of a goddess seated on a throne and wearing a polos and a stiff garment decorated with animals , a horse , a lion , and a sphinx . The goddess could have represented either Rhea or Artemis as the mistress of animals .

  "/wiki/Frieze": "In architecture , the frieze /fri\u02d0z/ is the wide central section part of an entablature and may be plain in the Ionic or Doric order , or decorated with bas-reliefs . Paterae are also usually used to decorate friezes . Even when neither columns nor pilasters are expressed , on an astylar wall it lies upon the architrave ( main beam ) and is capped by the moldings of the cornice . A frieze can be found on many Greek and Roman buildings , the Parthenon Frieze being the most famous , and perhaps the most elaborate . This style is typical for the Persians . In interiors , the frieze of a room is the section of wall above the picture rail and under the crown moldings or cornice . By extension , a frieze is a long stretch of painted , sculpted or even calligraphic decoration in such a position , normally above eye-level . Frieze decorations may depict scenes in a sequence of discrete panels . The material of which the frieze is made of may be plasterwork , carved wood or other decorative medium . In an example of an architectural frieze on the fa\u00e7ade of a building , the octagonal Tower of the Winds in the Roman agora at Athens bears relief sculptures of the eight winds on its frieze . A pulvinated frieze ( or pulvino ) is convex in section .

Leonardos in 1895 in relation to the youth from Keratea , and adopted by Henri Lechat as a generic term for the standing male figure in 1904 . Such statues are found across the Greek-speaking world ; the preponderance of these were found in sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoion , Boeotia , alone . These free-standing sculptures were typically marble , but the form is also rendered in limestone , wood , bronze , ivory and terracotta .

The city was founded by Ancient Greek Corinthians and Teneans and became a very powerful city-state . Syracuse was allied with Sparta and Corinth and exerted influence over the entirety of Magna Graecia , of which it was the most important city . Described by Cicero as the greatest Greek city and the most beautiful of them all , it equaled Athens in size during the fifth century BC . It later became part of the Roman Republic and the Byzantine Empire . Under Emperor Constans II , it served as the capital of the Byzantine Empire ( 663-669 ) .

The platform was built on a leveling course that flattened out the ground immediately beneath the temple . Some methodologies use the word stylobate to describe only the topmost step of the temple 's base , while stereobate is used to describe the remaining steps of the platform beneath the stylobate and just above the leveling course . Others use the term to refer to the entire platform . The stylobate was often designed to relate closely to the dimensions of other elements of the temple . In Greek Doric temples , the length and width of the stylobate were related , and in some early Doric temples the column height was one third the width of the stylobate . The Romans , following Etruscan architectural tradition , took a different approach in using a much higher stylobate that typically had steps only in the front , leading to the portico . In modern architecture the stylobate is the upper part of the stepped basement of the building , or the common basement floor , combining several buildings . Today , stylobates are popular in use in the construction of high-rise buildings , the so-called towers ( candles ) .",

It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives . The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and early 20th centuries .",
  "/wiki/Temple_C_(Selinus)": "Temple C at Selinus , Trapani ( Sicily ) , is a Greek temple in the doric style . It was one of the most ancient of the temples at Selinus , having probably been built on the acropolis a little after the middle of the sixth century BC , although its dating is controversial . The temple was the object of archaeological research in the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century and later the remains of a long stretch of the northern colonnade received anastylosis ( reconstruction using the original material ) in 1929 . After a twelve-year-long restoration , in 2011 the colonnade was freed from scaffolding and made properly visible once more . Temple C , was probably used as an archive ( hundreds of seals have been recovered from it ) and was dedicated to Apollo , as shown by an inscription , not to Heracles .",
