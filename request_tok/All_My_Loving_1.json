  "/wiki/Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks": "Alvin and the Chipmunks , originally David Seville and the Chipmunks or simply the Chipmunks , are an American animated virtual band created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. for a novelty record in 1958 . The group consists of three singing animated anthropomorphic chipmunks : Alvin , the mischievous troublemaker ; Simon , the tall , bespectacled intellectual ; and Theodore , the chubby , shy one . The trio is managed by their human adoptive father , David ( Dave ) Seville . In reality , David Seville was Bagdasarian 's stage name , and the Chipmunks themselves are named after the executives of their original record label . The characters became a success , and the singing Chipmunks and their manager were given life in several animated cartoon productions , using redrawn , anthropomorphic chipmunks , and eventually films . The voices of the group were all performed by Bagdasarian , who sped up the playback to create high-pitched squeaky voices . This oft-used process was not entirely new to Bagdasarian , who had also used it for two previous novelty songs , including Witch Doctor , but it was so unusual and well-executed it earned the record two Grammy Awards for engineering . Bagdasarian , performing as the Chipmunks , released a long line of albums and singles , with The Chipmunk Song becoming a number-one single in the United States . After Bagdasarian 's death in 1972 , the characters ' voices were performed by his son Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and the latter 's wife Janice Karman in the subsequent incarnations of the 1980s and 1990s . In the 2007 CGI/live-action film adaptation and its 2009 sequel , they were voiced in dialogue by Justin Long , Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney . Bagdasarian Jr. and Karman continue to perform the singing voices for Alvin , Theodore and the Chipettes , but Steve Vining does Simon 's singing voice . The project has earned five Grammy awards , an American Music Award , a Golden Reel Award , and three Kids ' Choice Awards , and has been nominated for three Emmy awards .",

  "/wiki/Beatallica": "Beatallica is a mash-up band that plays music made from combinations of songs of the Beatles and Metallica .

The Thing That Should Not Let It Be , combining The Beatles ' Let It Be and Metallica 's The Thing That Should Not Be or And Justice for All My Loving combining Metallica 's And Justice for All and the Beatles ' All My Loving ) , though sometimes just a Beatles song will be used as a basis with modified lyrics . The lyrics slip back and forth between the two songs , or occasionally neither , in lieu of original lyrics comically referencing Metallica , heavy metal music , or the heavy metal community . While the scansion and melody are usually Beatles-based , the music is played metal style with some Metallica riffs and solos thrown in . Consistent quirks made in the lyrics also criticize glam metal much in the fashion that thrash metal fans would do , as well as many references to blood . Their version of I Want to Hold Your Hand called I Want to Choke Your Band , is an example of their criticism towards glam metal . Although facing some misunderstandings in the media , members of Metallica itself have repeatedly praised the comedic styling of the group . For example , Kirk Hammett has publicly remarked point-blank , I think it 's cool , and , It 's just fun for me . James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich have also been friendly with the band .",

Under this line-up , they released the Keeper of the Seven Keys albums ( 1987 and 1988 ) , which established Helloween as a notable heavy metal band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre . Hansen left the band soon after the release of Part II and was replaced by Roland Grapow . After leaving Helloween , Hansen formed Gamma Ray . Helloween 's first two albums without Hansen , Pink Bubbles Go Ape ( 1991 ) and Chameleon ( 1993 ) , were commercial and critical failures , which created tensions between band members and led to the firing of Schwichtenberg and Kiske .

The albums released under this line-up , Master of the Rings ( 1994 ) , The Time of the Oath ( 1996 ) , Better Than Raw ( 1998 ) and The Dark Ride ( 2000 ) , received warmer reception from both fans and critics , gradually establishing Helloween as a successful band again .
