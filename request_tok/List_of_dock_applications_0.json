  "/wiki/OS_X_Dock": "The Dock is a prominent feature of the graphical user interface of macOS . It is used to launch applications and to switch between running applications . The Dock is also a prominent feature of macOS 's predecessor NeXTSTEP and OpenStep operating systems . The earliest known implementations of a dock are found in operating systems such as RISC OS and NeXTSTEP . iOS has its own version of the Dock for iPhone , iPod Touch and iPad . Apple applied for a US patent for the design of the Dock in 1999 and was granted the patent in October 2008 , nearly a decade later . Any application can be dragged and dropped onto the Dock to add it to the dock , and any application can be dragged from the dock to remove it , except for Finder and Trash , which are permanent fixtures as the leftmost and rightmost items ( or highest and lowest items if the Dock is vertically oriented ) , respectively . Part of the macOS Core Services , Dock.app is located at /System/Library/CoreServices/ .",
  "/wiki/OS_X": "macOS ( /\u02ccm\u00e6ko\u028a\u02c8\u025bs/ ; previously Mac OS X and later OS X ) is a series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001 . It is the primary operating system for Apple 's Mac computers . Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server . The initial version , Mac OS X Server 1.0 , was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5 .",

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

For instance , modification , redistribution by third parties , and reverse engineering without the author 's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others . Unlike with free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge , the source code for freeware is typically not made available . Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by , for example , encouraging sales of a more capable version , as in the freemium and shareware business models .",

Shareware is often offered as a download from a website or on a compact disc included with a magazine . [ citation needed ] Shareware differs from open-source software , in which the source code is available for anyone to inspect and alter ; and freeware , which is software distributed at no cost to the user but without source code being made available . There are many types of shareware , and while they may not require an initial up-front payment , many are intended to generate revenue in one way or another . Some limit use to personal non-commercial purposes only , with purchase of a license required for use in a business enterprise . The software itself may be limited in functionality or be time-limited , or it may remind the user that payment would be appreciated .",

When the user scrolls with the mouse wheel , the icons rotate towards a fixed point so the user can access a specific icon . Once an application is launched , SliderDock hides itself in the background so as to take up less space on the desktop . SliderDock was created with space in mind , and attempts to use the least amount of RAM it can when it 's not currently on-screen .

  "/wiki/Avant_Window_Navigator": "Avant Window Navigator ( abbreviated AWN or Awn ) is a dock-like bar for Linux , which sits on an edge of a user 's screen and tracks open windows . Instead of representing open windows as buttons or segments on a bar , it uses large icons on a translucent background to increase readability and add visual appeal . The program was created by Neil J. Patel . Both the appearance and functionality of Avant Window Navigator may be customized , and plugins and applets are available , such as to display the progress of a download in Mozilla Firefox or to control a music player like Rhythmbox . The plugins use the D-Bus IPC system , and applets can be written in C , Python or Vala . A sister project , AWN Extras , is a collection of community-contributed applets and plugins . Releases are usually kept in sync with AWN . One of the major requirements to run older versions of Avant Window Navigator is a compositing window manager . At least version 0.4.0-2 in the Debian repos has either Metacity , xcompmgr , Compiz , xfwm4 , KWin or Mutter as a dependency . Therefore , the user was required to install a compositor , which could tax performance on low-end systems . Some alternatives were to use a lightweight desktop environment such as Xfce , which has a compositing manager since version 4.2.0 , or to enable compositing in Metacity when using GNOME . However , support for non-composited environments is available in version 0.4.0 .",

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers ."
