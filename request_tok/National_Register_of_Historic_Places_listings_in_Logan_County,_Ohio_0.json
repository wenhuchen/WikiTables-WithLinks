  "/wiki/Dunns_Pond_Mound": "The Dunns Pond Mound is a historic Native American mound in northeastern Logan County , Ohio , United States . Located near Huntsville , it lies along the southeastern corner of Indian Lake in Washington Township . In 1974 , the mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a potential archeological site , with much of its significance deriving from its use as a burial site for as much as nine centuries . Other Native American earthworks are located in the vicinity . A 1914 study found fifteen mounds on the southeastern side of Indian Lake and characterized this remarkable group of mounds as the premier location of archeology in Logan County . Another four mounds in Washington Township , which were not included in the 1914 survey , are located on Lake Ridge Island , a short distance to the north of Dunns Pond . These mounds , the Lake Ridge Island Mounds , were listed on the Register on the same day as was the Dunns Pond Mound .",

  "/wiki/Hopewell_tradition": "The Hopewell tradition ( also called the Hopewell culture ) describes the common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern Eastern Woodlands from 100 BCE to 500 CE , in the Middle Woodland period . The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society , but a widely dispersed set of related populations . They were connected by a common network of trade routes , known as the Hopewell exchange system . At its greatest extent , the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Crystal River Indian Mounds in modern-day Florida as far north as the northern shores of Lake Ontario . Within this area , societies participated in a high degree of exchange with the highest amount of activity along waterways . The Hopewell exchange system received materials from all over what is now occupied by the United States . Most of the items traded were exotic materials and were received by people living in the major trading and manufacturing areas . These people then converted the materials into products and exported them through local and regional exchange networks . The objects created by the Hopewell exchange system spread far and wide and have been seen in many burials outside the Midwest .",

  "/wiki/Lake_Ridge_Island_Mounds": "The Lake Ridge Island Mounds ( also known as the Wolf Mounds I-IV ) are a group of small hills in Logan County , Ohio , United States that have been thought to be Native American mounds . Located in an area of about 5 acres ( 2.0 ha ) at the northern end on Lake Ridge Island in Indian Lake , :1 , 2 the mounds are near the village of Russells Point in the southeastern corner of Stokes Township . State Route 368 passes a short distance to the east of the mounds , even weaving at one point to avoid them . :2 The four mounds on the island are small , not reaching a height greater than 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) or a diameter greater than 40 feet ( 12 m ) ; :2 they are small enough that they appear to be natural knolls . A report produced in the 1970s observed that the mounds were in excellent condition at the time , never having been disturbed by artifact seekers . :2 An archeological survey of Logan County , published in 1914 , revealed a cluster of mounds on the southeastern shore of Indian Lake , but no mounds on Lake Ridge Island were observed by the survey . Typical of the mounds studied in the survey is the Dunns Pond Mound , located in the community of Moundwood a short distance south of Lake Ridge Island ; it is significantly larger than the Lake Ridge Island Mounds . The 1970s report highlighted the mounds as possible archeological sites , stating that they resembled small Hopewell mounds known elsewhere in Ohio and proposing that they were constructed by small groups of Hopewell who were isolated by time or distance from centers of Hopewell influence . As small mounds , they were assessed as being potentially significant for revealing the origins and demise of the Hopewell in the midwestern United States . :3 For this reason , the mounds were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1974 , along with the Dunns Pond Mound ; they are the only historic district in Logan County . In nominating the mounds for listing , the Ohio Historical Society noted the mounds ' location within Indian Lake State Park as being significant for archeological education : it was hoped that visitors to the park would become aware of the significance of the mounds and consequently seek to preserve archeological sites on their own properties . :3",

  "/wiki/Tumulus": "A tumulus ( plural tumuli ) is a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves . Tumuli are also known as barrows , burial mounds or kurgans , and may be found throughout much of the world . A cairn , which is a mound of stones built for various purposes , may also originally have been a tumulus . Tumuli are often categorised according to their external apparent shape . In this respect , a long barrow is a long tumulus , usually constructed on top of several burials , such as passage graves . A round barrow is a round tumulus , also commonly constructed on top of burials . The internal structure and architecture of both long and round barrows has a broad range ; the categorization only refers to the external apparent shape . The method of inhumation may involve a dolmen , a cist , a mortuary enclosure , a mortuary house , or a chamber tomb . Examples of barrows include Duggleby Howe and Maeshowe . The word tumulus is Latin for 'mound ' or 'small hill ' , which is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *teuh2- with extended zero grade *tum- , 'to bulge , swell ' also found in tomb , tumor , tumescent , thumb , thigh , and thousand .",

They include those with evangelical , holiness , liberal , and traditional Quaker understandings of Christianity . There are also Nontheist Quakers whose spiritual practice is not reliant on the existence of God . To differing extents , the different movements that make up the Religious Society of Friends/Friends Church avoid creeds and hierarchical structures . In 2007 , there were about 359,000 adult Quakers worldwide . In 2017 , there were 377,557 adult Quakers , with 49% in Africa . Around 89% of Quakers worldwide belong to the evangelical and programmed branches of Quakerism - these Quakers worship in services with singing and a prepared message from the Bible , coordinated by a pastor . Around 11% of Friends practice waiting worship , or unprogrammed worship ( more commonly known today as Meeting for Worship ) , where the order of service is not planned in advance , is predominantly silent , and may include unprepared vocal ministry from those present . Some meetings of both types have Recorded Ministers in their meetings - Friends recognised for their gift of vocal ministry . The first Quakers lived in mid-17th-century England .",
  "/wiki/McColly_Covered_Bridge": "The McColly Covered Bridge is a historic wooden covered bridge in western Logan County , Ohio , United States .

It carries County Road 13 ( formerly called the Covered Bridge Pike ) over the Great Miami River , approximately 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) south of its source at Indian Lake . The bridge was built in 1876 by the Anderson Green Company of Sidney , Ohio at a cost of $ 3,103 and named for nearby landowner Nicholas McColly . :3 Although Anderson Green built many other bridges statewide , including another bridge in southwestern Logan County , it is the only remaining bridge built by the company in any location . It is approximately 142 feet ( 43 m ) long , with a clearance of 16 feet ( 4.9 m ) and a total width of 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) . :2 In 1974 , the McColly Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its significance in Ohio 's history . :4 At that time , it was one of only eighteen remaining Howe truss bridges in Ohio . :3 Although the nomination assessed its condition at good , by the 1990s , the number of Howe truss bridges nearly fell to seventeen , as the McColly Bridge had deteriorated to the point that an engineering survey in 1996 pronounced it to be in imminent danger of collapse . Restorations in 1943 and 1958 involved replacement of floorboards , strengthening of trusses , and raising the bridge to reduce the danger of flooding . Despite these repairs , the county closed the bridge in July 1993 due to structural deterioration from vandalism and recent floods . The 1996 engineering summary identified several serious faults : the bridge had tilted so that its portals were no longer square , many of the beams had rotted , a collision had damaged the interior , and nearly one-third of the bridge 's siding had disappeared .",

  "/wiki/Holland_Theater": "The Holland Theatre was a movie theater that operated in Bellefontaine , Ohio , United States . Like many historic theaters , the Holland ultimately went out of business after a newer , more technologically advanced cinema , was introduced to the town . Built in 1931 , the Holland originally had the capability for both cinema and stage plays , but it was known for large depictions of a 17th-century Dutch landscape that lined both interior sidewalls of the theater . The displays included windmills that slowly turned . The Holland was eventually converted to a 5 screen multiplex , with the main screen remaining in the auditorium in front of the stage . The theater 's balcony was split in half and converted into two screens , and two additional screens were constructed in the rear of the cinema where the stage previously existed . Although the original theater was closed in 1998 , the building is open and hosts various fine arts events , while a preservation group works to restore the theater . In 2010 , the theater received a grant from the Ohio Cultural Facilities Commission ; the theater board has installed a new lighting system with the grant money . Individuals associated with the theater believe that it is the only atmospheric theater in the United States built in a primarily Dutch style of architecture ."
