  "/wiki/Reincarnation": "Reincarnation is the philosophical or religious concept that the non-physical essence of a living being starts a new life in a different physical form or body after biological death . It is also called rebirth or transmigration . Reincarnation is a central tenet of Indian religions , namely Jainism , Buddhism , Sikhism and Hinduism , although there are Hindu groups that do not believe in reincarnation but believe in an afterlife . It is an esoteric belief in many streams of Orthodox Judaism and is found ( in different forms ) in some beliefs of North American Natives and some Native Australians ( while most believe in an afterlife or spirit world ) . A belief in rebirth/metempsychosis was held by Greek historic figures , such as Pythagoras , Socrates , and Plato . It is also a belief in various modern religions . Although the majority of denominations within Christianity and Islam do not believe that individuals reincarnate , particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation ; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Cathars , Alawites , the Druze , and the Rosicrucians . The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of Neoplatonism , Orphism , Hermeticism , Manicheanism , and Gnosticism of the Roman era as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research . In recent decades , many Europeans and North Americans have developed an interest in reincarnation , and many contemporary works mention it .",

Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically , [ g ] although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus . [ h ] [ i ] Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry . He preached orally and was often referred to as rabbi . Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God , engaged in healings , taught in parables and gathered followers . He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities , turned over to the Roman government , and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate , the Roman prefect . After his death , his followers believed he rose from the dead , and the community they formed eventually became the early Church . Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit , was born of a virgin named Mary , performed miracles , founded the Christian Church , died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin , rose from the dead , and ascended into Heaven , from where he will return . Most Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God .

  "/wiki/Salt_Lake_City,_Utah": "Salt Lake City ( often shortened to Salt Lake and abbreviated as SLC ) is the capital and most populous municipality of the U.S. state of Utah , as well as the seat of Salt Lake County , the most populous county in Utah . With an estimated population of 200,591 in 2018 , the city is the core of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area , which has a population of 1,222,540 ( 2018 estimate ) . Salt Lake City is further situated within a larger metropolis known as the Salt Lake City-Ogden-Provo Combined Statistical Area , a corridor of contiguous urban and suburban development stretched along a 120-mile ( 190 km ) segment of the Wasatch Front , comprising a population of 2,606,548 ( as of 2018 estimates ) . It is one of only two major urban areas in the Great Basin . The world headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) is located in Salt Lake City . The city was founded in 1847 by followers of the church , led by Brigham Young , who were seeking to escape persecution that they had experienced while living farther east . The Mormon pioneers , as they would come to be known , entered an arid valley and immediately began building , planning , and extending an extensive irrigation network which could feed the population and foster future growth . Salt Lake City 's street grid system is based on a standard compass grid plan , with the Salt Lake Temple at the origin . Due to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake , the city was named Great Salt Lake City . In 1868 , the 17th Utah Territorial Legislature dropped the word Great from the city 's name . Immigration of international members of the church , mining booms , and the construction of the first transcontinental railroad initially brought economic growth , and the city was nicknamed the Crossroads of the West . It was traversed by the Lincoln Highway , the first transcontinental highway , in 1913 .",
  "/wiki/Anti-Mormon": "Anti-Mormonism is discrimination , persecution , hostility or prejudice directed against the Latter Day Saint movement , particularly The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) . The term is often used to describe people or literature that are critical of their adherents , institutions , or beliefs , or physical attacks against specific Saints or the Latter Day Saint movement as a whole . Opposition to Mormonism began before the first Latter Day Saint church was established in 1830 and continues to the present day . The most vocal and strident opposition occurred during the 19th century , particularly during the Utah War of the 1850s , and in the second half of the century when the practice of polygamy in Utah Territory was widely considered by the U.S. Republican Party as one of the twin relics of barbarism along with slavery . Modern-day opposition generally takes the form of websites , podcasts , videos or other media offering alternative views about Mormonism or non-violent protest at large Latter-day Saint gatherings such as the church 's semiannual General Conference , outside of Latter-day Saint pageants , or at events surrounding the construction of new LDS temples . Opponents generally believe that the church 's claims to divine origin are false , that it is non-Christian , or that it is a religion based on fraud or deceit on the part of its past and present leaders . In 2015 , the FBI began tracking anti-Mormon hate crimes in the United States and have noted an increase in incidents over time .",

  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) ."
