It also borders Northamptonshire in the south for just 20 yards ( 19 m ) , England 's shortest county boundary . The county town is the city of Lincoln , where the county council has its headquarters . The ceremonial county of Lincolnshire is composed of the non-metropolitan county of Lincolnshire and the area covered by the unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire . Part of the ceremonial county is in the Yorkshire and the Humber region of England , and most is in the East Midlands region . The county is the second-largest of the English ceremonial counties and one that is predominantly agricultural in land use . The county is fourth-largest of the two-tier counties , as the unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire are not included . The county has several geographical sub-regions , including the rolling chalk hills of the Lincolnshire Wolds . In the southeast are the Lincolnshire Fens ( southeast Lincolnshire ) , the Carrs ( similar to the Fens but in north Lincolnshire ) , the industrial Humber Estuary and North Sea coast around Grimsby and Scunthorpe , and in the southwest of the county , the Kesteven Uplands , comprising rolling limestone hills in the district of South Kesteven .",
  "/wiki/Belton_House": "Belton House is a Grade I listed country house in the parish of Belton near Grantham in Lincolnshire , England , built between 1685 and 1688 by Sir John Brownlow , 3rd Baronet . It is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park . Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture , the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period . It is considered to be a complete example of a typical English country house . For about three centuries until 1984 , Belton House was the seat successively of the Brownlow family , which had first acquired land in the area in the late 16th century , and of its heirs the Cust family ( in 1815 created Earl Brownlow ) . Despite his great wealth Sir John Brownlow , 3rd Baronet , chose to build a comparatively modest house rather than one of the grand Baroque palaces being built by others at the time . The contemporary , if provincial , Carolean style was the selected choice of design . The new house was fitted with the latest innovations such as sash windows for the principal rooms , and more significantly , with completely separate areas for the staff . Successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes , yet the fabric and design of the house changed little . Following World War I the Custs , like many wealthy English families , were faced with mounting financial problems and finally in 1984 they donated the house , with most of its contents , to the National Trust , which now opens Belton to the public . It is in a good state of repair and is visited by many thousands of tourists each year .",

It is a social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British , Irish , Breton , New Zealand , Canadian , South African and Australian cultures . In many places , especially in villages , a pub is the focal point of the community . In his 17th-century diary , Samuel Pepys described the pub as the heart of England . Pubs can be traced back to Roman taverns , through the Anglo-Saxon alehouse to the development of the tied house system in the 19th century . In 1393 , King Richard II of England introduced legislation that pubs had to display a sign outdoors to make them easily visible for passing ale tasters , who would assess the quality of ale sold . Most pubs focus on offering beers , ales and similar drinks . As well , pubs often sell wines , spirits , and soft drinks , meals and snacks . The owner , tenant or manager ( licensee ) is known as the pub landlord or landlady , or publican . Referred to as their local by regulars , pubs are typically chosen for their proximity to home or work , the availability of a particular beer or ale or a good selection , good food , a social atmosphere , the presence of friends and acquaintances , and the availability of recreational activities such as a darts team , a skittles team , and a pool or snooker table .

  "/wiki/Keep": "A keep ( from the Middle English kype ) is a type of fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility . Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep , but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences , used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary . The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the Motte-and-Bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century ; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066 , and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s . The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries ; these included Norman keeps , with a square or rectangular design , and circular shell keeps . Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade or more to build . During the 12th century , new designs began to be introduced - in France , quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced , while in England polygonal towers were built . By the end of the century , French and English keep designs began to diverge : Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories , while in England castles were built without keeps . In Spain , keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles , although in Germany tall fighting towers called bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion . In the second half of the 14th century , there was a resurgence in the building of keeps . In France , the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall , heavily machicolated designs , a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design . Meanwhile , tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles : these large keeps , each uniquely designed , formed part of the grandest castles built during the period . In the 15th century , the protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery .",

As a tourist centre , it was boosted when a railway opened in 1844 gave visitors easier , cheaper access and triggered an influx of settlers .
