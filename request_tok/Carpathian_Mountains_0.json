Usually listed at 2,655 metres AMSL ( 8,711 ft ) , its exact elevation is actually 0.6 metres ( 2.0 feet ) lower . [ citation needed ] The pyramidal shape of the massif is marked by a huge cirque . Despite its relatively low elevation , the about 2,000 m vertical rise from the valley floor makes Gerlachovsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt soar . Mistaken for an average mountain in the rugged High Tatras range in the more distant past , it has since played a symbolic role in the eyes of the rulers and populations of several Central European nations , to the point that between the 19th and mid-20th century , it had four different names with six name reversals . It managed to be the highest mountain of the Kingdom of Hungary , and of the countries of Czechoslovakia , Slovakia and then Czechoslovakia again within the span of less than three decades of the 20th century . Gerlachovsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt shares its geology and ecology with the rest of the High Tatras , but provides a worthwhile environment for biologists as the highest ground anywhere in Europe north of the parallel linking approximately Munich , Salzburg , and Vienna . With the travel restrictions imposed by the Eastern Bloc , the mountain was particularly treasured as the loftiest point available to climb to by Czechs , East Germans , Hungarians , Poles , and Slovaks . It continues to attract its share of visitors although the local authorities have been continually adding new restrictions on access .",

It is bordered by Poland to the north , Ukraine to the east , Hungary to the south , Austria to the southwest , and the Czech Republic to the northwest . Slovakia 's territory spans about 49,000 square kilometres ( 19,000 sq mi ) and is mostly mountainous . The population is over 5.6 million and consists mostly of Slovaks . The capital and largest city is Bratislava , and the second-largest city is Ko\u0161ice . The official language is Slovak . The Slavs arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries . In the 7th century they played a significant role in the creation of Samo 's Empire and in the 9th century established the Principality of Nitra , which was later conquered by the Principality of Moravia to establish Great Moravia . In the 10th century , after the dissolution of Great Moravia , the territory was integrated into the Principality of Hungary , which would become the Kingdom of Hungary in 1000 . In 1241 and 1242 , much of the territory was destroyed by the Mongols during their invasion of Central and Eastern Europe . The area was recovered largely thanks to B\u00e9la IV of Hungary who also settled Germans who became an important ethnic group in the area , especially in what are today parts of central and eastern Slovakia . After World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , the Czechoslovak National Council established Czechoslovakia ( 1918-1939 ) .",
