  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",

With an estimated population of 2,705,994 ( 2018 ) , it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States . Chicago is the county seat of Cook County , the second-most-populous county in the US , with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport . Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",

  "/wiki/R._J._Hackett_(steamer)": "R. J. Hackett ( official number 21934 ) was a steamer built in 1869 . When first launched , the ship 's wide cross-section and long midships hold were unconventional , but the design 's advantages in moving cargo through the inland lakes spawned many imitators . The Hackett is recognized as the first Great Lakes freighter , a vessel type that has dominated Great Lakes shipping for over 100 years . In 1905 , the Hackett caught fire and sank on Whaleback Shoal in Green Bay , 9.5 miles ( 15.3 km ) southeast of the Cedar River in Menominee County , Michigan . The wreck site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 .",
  "/wiki/Great_Lakes_freighter": "Lake freighters , or lakers , are bulk carrier vessels that ply the Great Lakes of North America . These vessels are traditionally called boats , although classified as ships . Since the late 19th century , lakers have carried bulk cargoes of materials such as limestone , iron ore , grain , coal , or salt from the mines and fields of the upper Great Lakes to the populous industrial areas farther east . The 63 commercial ports handled 173 million tons of cargo in 2006 . Because of winter ice on the lakes , the navigation season is not usually year-round . The Soo Locks and Welland Canal close from mid-January to late March , when most boats are laid up for maintenance . Crewmembers spend these months ashore . Depending on their application , lakers may also be referred to by their type , such as oreboats ( primarily for iron ore ) , straight deckers ( no self-unloading gear ) , bulkers ( carry bulk cargo ) , sternenders ( all cabins aft ) , self unloaders ( with self unloading gear ) , longboats ( for their slender appearance ) , or lakeboats , among others . In the mid-20th century , 300 lakers worked the Lakes , but by the early 21st century there were fewer than 140 active lakers .

  "/wiki/Great_Lakes": "The Great Lakes ( French : les Grands Lacs ) , also called the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Great Lakes of North America , are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America , on the Canada-United States border , which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River . They comprise Lakes Superior , Michigan , Huron , Erie , and Ontario . Hydrologically , there are only four lakes , because Lakes Michigan and Huron join at the Straits of Mackinac . The lakes form the Great Lakes Waterway . The Great Lakes are the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth by total area , and second-largest by total volume , containing 21% of the world 's surface fresh water by volume . The total surface is 94,250 square miles ( 244,106 km2 ) , and the total volume ( measured at the low water datum ) is 5,439 cubic miles ( 22,671 km3 ) , slightly less than the volume of Lake Baikal ( 5,666 cu mi or 23,615 km3 , 22-23% of the world 's surface fresh water ) . Due to their sea-like characteristics ( rolling waves , sustained winds , strong currents , great depths , and distant horizons ) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as inland seas . Lake Superior is the second-largest lake in the world by area , and the largest freshwater lake by area . Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country . The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around 14,000 years ago , as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater . The lakes have been a major source for transportation , migration , trade , and fishing , serving as a habitat to many aquatic species in a region with much biodiversity . The surrounding region is called the Great Lakes region , which includes the Great Lakes Megalopolis .",

  "/wiki/Red_Ocher_people": "The Red Ocher people were an indigenous people of North America . A series of archaeological sites located in the Upper Great Lakes , the Greater Illinois River Valley , and the Ohio River Valley in the American Midwest have been discovered to be a Red Ocher burial complex , dating from 1000 BC to 400 BC , the Terminal Archaic - Early Woodland period . Characterized as shallow burials located in sandy ridges along river valleys , covered in red ochre or hydrated iron oxide ( FeH3O ) , they contain diagnostic artifacts that include caches of flint points , turkey-tails , and various forms of worked copper . Turkey-tails are large flint blades of a distinct type . It is believed that Red Ocher people spoke an ancestral form of the Algonquian languages . Red ochre has a long history of use in North America ; as early as the Folsom tradition during the Paleo-Indian period , certain localities in New Mexico and Wyoming were being mined for the substance . The people today known as Red Ocher were first identified by the University of Chicago in 1937 . During the late 1950s and early 1960s , the Red Ocher Culture was a topic of great interest among archaeologists who were trying to better define the burial culture through various methods of research . Since then intermittent archaeological works have been published dealing with specific sub-topics within the burial culture and supported by more reliable AMS carbon dates . Nevertheless , many important archaeological questions regarding the Red Ocher burial manifestation and cultural phenomenon are still without answers .",
  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",
  "/wiki/Mississippian_culture": "The Mississippian culture was a mound-building Native American civilization that flourished in what is now the Midwestern , Eastern , and Southeastern United States from approximately 800 to 1600 , varying regionally . It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages ( suburbs ) linked together by loose trading networks . The largest city was Cahokia , believed to be a major religious center . The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley ( for which it is named ) . Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point . Almost all dated Mississippian sites predate 1539-1540 ( when Hernando de Soto explored the area ) , with notable exceptions being Natchez communities that maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century .",
  "/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating": "Radiocarbon dating ( also referred to as carbon dating or carbon-14 dating ) is a method for determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon , a radioactive isotope of carbon . The method was developed in the late 1940s at the University of Chicago by Willard Libby , who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in 1960 . It is based on the fact that radiocarbon ( 14C ) is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen . The resulting 14C combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide , which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis ; animals then acquire 14C by eating the plants . When the animal or plant dies , it stops exchanging carbon with its environment , and thereafter the amount of 14C it contains begins to decrease as the 14C undergoes radioactive decay . Measuring the amount of 14C in a sample from a dead plant or animal , such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone , provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died . The older a sample is , the less 14C there is to be detected , and because the half-life of 14C ( the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed ) is about 5,730 years , the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50,000 years ago , although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples . Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of 14C in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years . The resulting data , in the form of a calibration curve , is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample 's calendar age . Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of 14C in different types of organisms ( fractionation ) , and the varying levels of 14C throughout the biosphere ( reservoir effects ) . Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil , and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s . Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to fossil fuels is substantially longer than the time it takes for its 14C to decay below detectable levels , fossil fuels contain almost no 14C , and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of 14C in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century .",
