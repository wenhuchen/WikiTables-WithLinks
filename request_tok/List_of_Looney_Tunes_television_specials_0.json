  "/wiki/Daffy_Duck_and_Porky_Pig_Meet_the_Groovie_Goolies": "Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies is a 1972 animated one-hour TV-movie ( with a live-action segment near the end ) that was part of The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie . In this Filmation-produced movie , Daffy Duck , Porky Pig , and other Looney Tunes characters interact with the characters from the Filmation series Groovie Goolies . This movie is notable for being the one and only time that Warner Bros. loaned out their famous Looney Tunes characters to appear in a Filmation production ( otherwise they were a silent partner ) . Warner Bros. had shut down their animation studio in 1969 . While Warner Bros. had outsourced production to other companies since the 1960s , it was usually to studios run by former Warner Bros. alumni ( such as Friz Freleng and later Chuck Jones ) , something that was not the case with Filmation .",

  "/wiki/Bugs_and_Daffy's_Carnival_of_the_Animals": "Bugs and Daffy 's Carnival of the Animals ( originally aired on TV as Carnival of the Animals ) is a live action/animated television special featuring the Looney Tunes characters Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck and directed by Chuck Jones . The special , based on Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns ' musical suite of the same name and consisting of entirely new animation , was purposely cast in the successful mold of Jones ' own earlier musical cartoons ( including Rabbit of Seville , Long-Haired Hare and Baton Bunny ) , and is set the familiar showbiz rivalry between Bugs and Daffy against the orchestral backdrop of conductor Michael Tilson Thomas , in a performance based on the music of Saint-Sa\u00ebns and the poetry of Ogden Nash . Carnival of the Animals originally aired on CBS on November 22 , 1976 , and was the first Warner Bros.-commissioned work featuring Bugs Bunny following the release of the cartoon False Hare , as well as their first Looney Tunes production following the second closure of their original animation studio in 1969 . This is an abridged version of the work , omitting the Tortoise , Characters with Long Ears , Cuckoo and Swan movements and using the Pianists music over the ending credits .",
  "/wiki/Looney_Tunes_Golden_Collection:_Volume_5": "Looney Tunes Golden Collection : Volume 5 is a Looney Tunes collection on DVD . Following the pattern of one release each year of the previous volumes , it was released on October 30 , 2007 . The four discs in this collection are devoted to themes and subjects the cartoons in each disc have in common . The first disc consists entirely of cartoons starring the two top stars of Warner cartoons , Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck . The second disc consists entirely of cartoons which lampoon fairy tales . The third disc consists entirely of cartoons either directed or co-directed by Bob Clampett . The fourth disc titled Early Daze features rarely seen cartoons from the 1930s and early 1940s which were made in black-and-white . Continuing a pattern which began with Looney Tunes Golden Collection : Volume 3 , the DVD set has a warning in the beginning of each disc that states that some of the cartoons contain ethnic and racial stereotypes that may be offensive to modern audiences ; however , like the fourth volume , the warning is shown on a title card rather than done as a special introduction . This volume did not sell as well as the previous volumes did , mainly due to the slump of the country 's economy at this point , and partly due to stiff competition from DVD release of rival studio Pixar 's Ratatouille . As a result , it was decided that both this and Volume 6 release outside of North America would be delayed/not occur . [ citation needed ] Eventually , the fifth volume was released on April 18 , 2011 in Region 2 UK .",
  "/wiki/Looney_Tunes_Golden_Collection:_Volume_6": "Looney Tunes Golden Collection : Volume 6 is a four-disc DVD box set collection of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons . Following the pattern of one release each year of the previous volumes , it was released on October 21 , 2008 . Warner Home Video had announced that this will be the final release in the Golden Collection series . Succeeding the Golden Collection series would be the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection series on Blu-ray , which had its first release in November 2011 . On July 3 , 2012 , a two-disc DVD version of Volume 1 of the Platinum Collection was released . Volume 6 is far less child-friendly than the other five volumes in the series . Like Volumes 3 , 4 , and 5 , it has a warning before each disc about the shorts containing content that some viewers would not consider to be politically correct by today 's standards ( but will be shown uncut and uncensored for historical reasons ) , and as such , is intended for the adult collector . However , Volume 6 's disclaimer states that it is not suitable for children , as opposed to Volumes 3-5 stating that they may not be suitable for children . This is due to that in addition to containing cartoons that have racial and/or ethnic stereotypes ( like in Volumes 3 , 4 , and 5 ) and references to sexism in Robert McKimson 's Wild Wife , Volume 6 also contains many cartoons that pertain to World War II , most of them containing depictions or references to Adolf Hitler and Hideki Tojo or to Nazis and Imperial Japan in general . While Volumes 4 and 5 each had a couple explicitly WWII themed cartoons ( Plane Daffy and Scrap Happy Daffy , respectively ) , Volume 6 is notable for having an entire disc dedicated to the subject ( Disc 2 : Patriotic Pals ) , including several of its bonus cartoons . Volume 6 was originally only released in North America due to the poor sales of Volume 5 . However , the discs in this volume were not region-coded , making it easy for collectors outside of North America to import and play this set .",
