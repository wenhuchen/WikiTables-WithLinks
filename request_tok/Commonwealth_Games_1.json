  "/wiki/Cricket_at_the_Commonwealth_Games": "Cricket was included in the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Malaysia . This was the only time cricket was played at a Commonwealth Games until a women 's tournament was included in the 2022 Commonwealth Games . Matches were played over 50 overs , and had List A status rather than full One Day Internationals . As is normal at the multisports events , the Caribbean islands that entered participated as separate nations , not as the combined West Indies team . Indeed , the Games were the first occasion on which an Antigua and Barbuda side competed at a senior level . Northern Ireland also entered , this occurrence being noteworthy because Irish cricket is usually represented by an all-island Irish cricket team . Sixteen teams entered the competition , including seven of the nine then Test-playing nations : West Indies did not enter as mentioned above , while England declined to send a team at all , on the grounds that the September date chosen clashed with other fixtures such as the end of the County Championship . The strength of the teams that were entered varied somewhat . Strong squads including seasoned Test and ODI players were fielded by the three nations that eventually won medals : Bronze medalists New Zealand with Stephen Fleming and Daniel Vettori , silver medalists Australia with Steve and Mark Waugh , Adam Gilchrist , Ricky Ponting , Damien Fleming and Darren Lehmann and gold medalists South Africa with Shaun Pollock , Jacques Kallis , Makhaya Ntini , Mark Boucher , and Herschelle Gibbs . India and Pakistan sent weakened teams as a result of a clash with the 1998 Sahara Cup , although India still named Sachin Tendulkar , Anil Kumble , Harbhajan Singh and VVS Laxman in its Commonwealth team while Pakistan included Shoaib Akhtar . Other notable cricketers who took part in the Commonwealth tournament included Sri Lanka 's Mahela Jayawardene , Zimbabwe 's Andy Flower and the West Indies ' Curtly Ambrose and Richie Richardson , playing for their home country of Antigua and Barbuda under the Commonwealth format .",
