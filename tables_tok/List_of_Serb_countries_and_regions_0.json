        "Zeta ( Serbian Cyrillic : \u0417\u0435\u0442\u0430 ) was one of the medieval polities that existed between 1356 and 1421 , whose territory encompassed parts of present-day Montenegro and northern Albania , ruled by the Bal\u0161i\u0107 family . Zeta was a crown land of the Grand Principality and Kingdom of Serbia , ruled by heirs to the Serbian throne from the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty . In the mid-14th century , Zeta was divided into Upper and Lower Zeta , governed by magnates . After Stefan Du\u0161an ( r. 1331-55 ) , his son Stefan Uro\u0161 V ruled Serbia during the fall of the Serbian Empire ; a gradual disintegration of the Empire as a result of decentralization in which provincial lords gained semi-autonomy and eventually independence . The Bal\u0161i\u0107i wrestled the Zeta region in 1356-62 , when they removed the two rulers in Upper and Lower Zeta . Ruling as lords , they empowered themselves and over the decades became an important player in Balkan politics . Zeta was united into the Serbian Despotate in 1421 , after Bal\u0161a III abdicated and passed the rule to his uncle , Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 ( maternally a Nemanji\u0107 )",

Bosnia experienced de facto independence in the 13th and 14th centuries despite being a part of the Hungarian Crown Lands . Its difficult terrain and remoteness enabled the Bosnians to maneuver between their two powerful neighbors , Hungary and Serbia , usually managing to avoid subordination to either . Several capable rulers allowed Bosnia briefly to play the role of a regional power in the 14th century",
