  "/wiki/Kaempferol": "Kaempferol ( 3,4\u2032,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone ) is a natural flavonol , a type of flavonoid , found in a variety of plants and plant-derived foods including kale , beans , tea , spinach and broccoli . Kaempferol is a yellow crystalline solid with a melting point of 276-278 \u00b0C ( 529-532 \u00b0F ) . It is slightly soluble in water and highly soluble in hot ethanol , ethers , and DMSO . Kaempferol acts as an antioxidant by reducing oxidative stress . Many studies suggest that consuming kaempferol may reduce the risk of various cancers , and it is currently under consideration as a possible cancer treatment [ citation needed ] . It is named for 17th-century German naturalist Engelbert Kaempfer .",

  "/wiki/Myricetin": "Myricetin is a member of the flavonoid class of polyphenolic compounds , with antioxidant properties . Common dietary sources include vegetables ( including tomatoes ) , fruits ( including oranges ) , nuts , berries , tea , and red wine . Myricetin is structurally similar to fisetin , luteolin , and quercetin and is reported to have many of the same functions as these other members of the flavonol class of flavonoids . Reported average intake of myricetin per day varies depending on diet , but has been shown in the Netherlands to average 23 mg/day . Myricetin is produced from the parent compound taxifolin through the ( + ) -dihydromyricetin intermediate and can be further processed to form laricitrin and then syringetin , both members of the flavonol class of flavonoids . Dihydromyricetin is frequently sold as a supplement and has controversial function as a partial GABAA receptor potentiator and treatment in Alcohol Use Disorder ( AUD ) .
