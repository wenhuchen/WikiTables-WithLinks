  "section_text": "Further information : World Rugby Sevens Challenger Series In 2019 , World Rugby announced a plan to create a second tier competition that would allow the best thirteen sevens teams , with the addition of three invited teams , from their region to compete in a similar style format to the Sevens Series for the potential of gaining promotion to the World Rugby Sevens Series and becoming a core team . [ 32 ] This breaks from the usual format of promotion and relegation in the sevens series . The proposal was well received from the Tongan rugby sevens team , whom will be one of the sixteen teams competing in the tournament . Coach Tevita Tu'ifua said about the news , `` We are so excited and very happy and it is a blessing for us to get involved in any tournament for the sake of the rugby sevens programme back home . `` [ 33 ] From 2013\u201314 series to 2018\u201319 the promotion/relegation was as follows : [ 15 ] One team is relegated and one team is promoted each year . The core team that finishes bottom of the table at the end of the season series is relegated . The team that wins the 12-team qualifying tournament at the Hong Kong Sevens is promoted . From 2020 onwards the style of promotion/relegation will be as such : One team is relegated and one team is promoted each year . The core team that finishes bottom of the table at the end of the season series is relegated to the Challenger Series . Eight teams will compete for promotion in the Hong Kong Sevens event after qualifying through the Challenger Series .",

  "intro": "The World Rugby Sevens Series is an annual series of international rugby sevens tournaments run by World Rugby featuring national sevens teams. Organised for the first time in the 1999-2000 season as the IRB World Sevens Series, the competition was formed to promote an elite-level of international rugby sevens and develop the game into a viable commercial product. The competition has been sponsored by banking group HSBC since 2014. The season's circuit consists of 10 tournaments that generally begin in November or December and last until May. The venues are held across 10 countries, and visits five of the six populated continents. The United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, France and England each host one event. Each tournament has 16 teams - 15 core teams that participate in each tournament and one regional qualifier. Teams compete for the World Rugby Series title by accumulating points based on their finishing position in each tournament. The lowest placed core team at the end of the season is dropped, and replaced by the winner of the Hong Kong Sevens. New Zealand had originally dominated the Series, winning each of the first six seasons from 1999-2000 to 2004-05, but since then, Fiji, South Africa and Samoa have each won season titles. England, Australia and the United States have placed in the top three for several seasons but have not won the series title. The International Olympic Committee's decision in 2009 to add rugby sevens to the Summer Olympics beginning in 2016 has added a boost to rugby sevens and to the World Sevens Series; this boost has led to increased exposure and revenues, leading several of the core teams to field fully professional squads."
