Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/Goaltender": "In ice hockey , the goaltender or goalie is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team 's net , thus preventing the opposing team from scoring . The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the goal crease ( often referred to simply as the crease or the net ) . Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots . In today 's age of goaltending there are two common styles , butterfly and hybrid ( hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique ) . Because of the power of shots , the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact . The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice , as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game . One-on-one situations , such as breakaways and shootouts , have the tendency to highlight a goaltender 's pure skill , or lack thereof . No more than one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time . Teams are not required to use a goaltender and may instead opt to play with an additional skater , but the defensive disadvantage this poses generally means that the strategy is only used as a desperation maneuver when trailing late in a game or can be used if the opposing team has a delayed penalty ( if the team receiving the penalty touches the puck the play will stop ) . The goaltender is also known as the goalie , goaler , goalkeeper , net minder , and tender by those involved in the hockey community . In the early days of the sport , the term was spelled with a hyphen as goal-tender . The art of playing the position is called goaltending and there are coaches , usually called the goalie coach who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders .",
