  "/wiki/Market_East,_Philadelphia": "Market Street , originally known as High Street , is a major east-west street in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . It is signed as Pennsylvania Route 3 between 38th Street ( U.S. Route 13 ) and 15th Street ( PA 611 ) . A short portion of the road continues west from Cobbs Creek Parkway ( 63rd Street ) to Delaware County . The High Street was the familiar name of the principal street in nearly every English town at the time Philadelphia was founded . But if Philadelphia was indebted to England for the name of High Street , nearly every American town is , in turn , indebted to Philadelphia for its Market Street . Long before the city was laid out or settled , Philadelphia 's founder , William Penn , had planned that markets would be held regularly on the 100-foot ( 30 m ) wide High Street . The city 's first market stalls were situated in the center of the thoroughfare starting at Front Street and proceeding west eventually to 8th Street . The stalls soon became covered and were not taken down as planned . Later , additional covered sheds appeared west of Center Square as the city expanded westward . The street began to be called Market Street around 1800 . The road 's new name was made official by an ordinance of 1858 , coincidentally , just a year before the market sheds were ordered removed . Market Street has been called the most historic highway in the United States because of the various historic sites along its eastern section .",

  "/wiki/37th_Street_station_(SEPTA)": "37th Street station , also known as 37th Street/Spruce Street/Woodland Avenue station , is a SEPTA Subway-Surface Lines trolley station in Philadelphia . It is the last station in the tunnel before the 40th Street Portal and carries Subway-Surface Trolley Routes 11 , 13 , 34 , & 36 . The entrance to go down into the eastbound side of the station is on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania and the entrance to go down into the westbound side of the station is on Spruce Street . The two stations are off set and are not on the same length of the track . Trolleys serving this station go eastbound to Center City Philadelphia and Westbound to the Philadelphia neighborhoods of Eastwick and Angora and the Delaware County suburbs of Yeadon and Darby . The reason why the station platforms are off set is because during construction of the subway station the above intersection was Spruce & 37th Streets at Woodland Avenue with all three streets crossing at a five points intersection . Upon entering the subway , 37th Street 's westbound platform is passed first , the exit/entrance was built on the north side of Spruce Street , and the eastbound could n't be on Spruce Street because it would have placed the subway exiting stairs in the middle of Spruce Street , so the eastbound platform exit/entrance was placed on the far side of Woodland Avenue ( now Woodland Walk ) . In October 2006 , Penn 's class of 1956 donated a new entrance for the Eastbound entrance of the station . The entrance is a replica of the Peter Witt trolleys ( manufactured by J. G. Brill Company from 1923-26 for Philadelphia ) that served the university students prior to 1956 . The trolleys brought commuting students to the campus as well as to Center City . The trolleys were operated by the Philadelphia Transportation Company and Routes 11 , 34 and 37 ran through the Penn campus on Woodland Avenue and Locust Streets for nearly 65 years . In 1956 , the trolley route was buried to enable the university to unify its campus .",
