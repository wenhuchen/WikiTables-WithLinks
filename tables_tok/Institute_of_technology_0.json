  "section_text": "FachhochschuleMain article : Fachhochschule Fachhochschulen were first founded in the early 1970s . They do not focus exclusively on technology , but may also offer courses in social science , medicine , business and design . They grant bachelor 's degrees and master 's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science . In 2009/10 , there existed about 200 Fachhochschulen in Germany . [ 14 ] See the German Wikipedia for a list . Technische Universit\u00e4t Technische Universit\u00e4t ( abbreviation : TU ) is the common term for universities of technology or technical university . These institutions can grant habilitation and doctoral degrees and focus on research . The nine largest and most renowned Technische Universit\u00e4ten in Germany have formed TU9 German Institutes of Technology as community of interests . Technische Universit\u00e4ten normally have faculties or departements of natural sciences and often of economics but can also have units of cultural and social sciences and arts . RWTH Aachen , TU Dresden and TU M\u00fcnchen also have a faculty of medicine associated with university hospitals ( Klinikum Aachen , University Hospital Dresden , Rechts der Isar Hospital ) . There are 17 universities of technology in Germany with about 290,000 students enrolled . The four states of Bremen , Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig-Holstein are not operating a Technische Universit\u00e4t . Saxony and Lower Saxony have the highest counts of TUs , while in Saxony three out of four universities are universities of technology .",
