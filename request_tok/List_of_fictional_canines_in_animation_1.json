However , its real use is to de-evolve children for slave trade . In some film versions of the story , Pinocchio is not fully transformed into a donkey . In the Disney version , for example , the transformation is arrested after he 's grown donkey ears and a tail by his escape from the island .

  "/wiki/Red_fox": "The red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely distributed members of the order Carnivora , being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa , North America and Eurasia . It is listed as least concern by the IUCN . Its range has increased alongside human expansion , having been introduced to Australia , where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations . Due to its presence in Australia , it is included on the list of the world 's 100 worst invasive species . The red fox originated from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period , and colonised North America shortly after the Wisconsin glaciation . Among the true foxes , the red fox represents a more progressive form in the direction of carnivory . Apart from its large size , the red fox is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments . Despite its name , the species often produces individuals with other colourings , including leucistic and melanistic individuals . Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised , which are divided into two categories : the large northern foxes , and the small , basal southern foxes of Asia and North Africa . Red foxes are usually together in pairs or small groups consisting of families , such as a mated pair and their young , or a male with several females having kinship ties . The young of the mated pair remain with their parents to assist in caring for new kits . The species primarily feeds on small rodents , though it may also target rabbits , game birds , reptiles , invertebrates and young ungulates .",

Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion .

  "/wiki/Helicopter": "A helicopter , or chopper , is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors . This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically , to hover , and to fly forward , backward , and laterally . These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL ( Vertical TakeOff and Landing ) aircraft can not perform . The English word helicopter is adapted from the French word h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re , coined by Gustave Ponton d'Am\u00e9court in 1861 , which originates from the Greek helix ( \u1f15\u03bb\u03b9\u03be ) helix , spiral , whirl , convolution and pteron ( \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd ) wing . English language nicknames for helicopter include chopper , copter , helo , heli , and whirlybird . Helicopters were developed and built during the first half-century of flight , with the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936 . Some helicopters reached limited production , but it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production , with 131 aircraft built . Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor , it is the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration . Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity . Coaxial helicopters , tiltrotor aircraft , and compound helicopters are all flying today . Quadcopter helicopters were pioneered as early as 1907 in France , and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones .",
