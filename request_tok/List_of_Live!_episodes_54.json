It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on . The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807 ; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 .",

  "/wiki/Catamaran": "A catamaran ( /\u02cck\u00e6t\u0259m\u0259\u02c8r\u00e6n/ ) ( informally , a cat ) is a multi-hulled watercraft featuring two parallel hulls of equal size . It is a geometry-stabilized craft , deriving its stability from its wide beam , rather than from a ballasted keel as with a monohull sailboat . Catamarans were invented by the Austronesian peoples which enabled their expansion to the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans . Catamarans typically have less hull volume , smaller displacement , and shallower draft ( draught ) than monohulls of comparable length . The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls , requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors . The catamaran 's wider stance on the water can reduce both heeling and wave-induced motion , as compared with a monohull , and can give reduced wakes . Catamarans range in size from small ( sailing or rowing vessels ) to large ( naval ships and car ferries ) . The structure connecting a catamaran 's two hulls ranges from a simple frame strung with webbing to support the crew to a bridging superstructure incorporating extensive cabin and/or cargo space .",
