  "section_text": "See also : Horror host Radio drama horror and suspense anthology series devoted to horror and suspense plays , such as Lights Out , Quiet , Please , The Whistler , and Inner Sanctum Mysteries , which broadcast from the 1930's-1950 's , had sinister `` hosts '' who introduced and wrapped up the stories . The tradition was introduced into horror comics , many of which were also anthology titles , with many stories in each issue . EC Comics utilized the conceit of a character who `` hosted '' the book , often starring in a framing sequence at the beginning of each issue . The most notorious EC hosts were the `` GhouLunatics '' : The Crypt Keeper , The Old Witch , and The Vault-Keeper . In the 1960s , Warren came up with the hosts Uncle Creepy and Cousin Eerie , and DC followed suit with their hosts Cain and Abel ( as well as such minor hosts as Eve , Destiny , Lucien , and the Mad Mod Witch ) . [ 85 ] Charlton had a large cast of hosts for their horror/suspense titles . Marvel Comics for the most part did not , though they briefly used the characters of Digger and Headstone P. Gravely . The following is a list of hosts from various horror comics titles from over the years .",

  "intro": "Horror comics are comic books, graphic novels, black-and-white comics magazines, and manga focusing on horror fiction. In the US market, horror comic books reached a peak in the late 1940s through the mid-1950s, when concern over content and the imposition of the self-censorship Comics Code Authority contributed to the demise of many titles and the toning down of others. Black-and-white horror-comics magazines, which did not fall under the Code, flourished from the mid-1960s through the early 1980s from a variety of publishers. Mainstream American color comic books experienced a horror resurgence in the 1970s, following a loosening of the Code. While the genre has had greater and lesser periods of popularity, it occupies a firm niche in comics as of the 2010s. Precursors to horror comics include detective and crime comics that incorporated horror motifs into their graphics, and early superhero stories that sometimes included the likes of ghouls and vampires. Individual horror stories appeared as early as 1940. The first dedicated horror comic books appear to be Gilberton Publications' Classic Comics #13 (August 1943), with its full-length adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Avon Publications' anthology Eerie #1 (January 1947), the first horror comic with original content. The first horror-comics series is the anthology Adventures into the Unknown, premiering in 1948 from American Comics Group, initially under the imprint B&I Publishing."
