During the mid to late 16th century , several expeditions were made by various groups of people in order to locate what they believed to be a city rich with gold ; El Dorado . In 1541 Gonzalo Pizarro , governor of Quito , Ecuador , banded together 340 soldiers and about 4000 natives and led them in search of the fabled city . That same year , Philipp von Hutten led an exploring party from Coro on the coast of Venezuela . Despite having been disproven by Alexander von Humboldt during his Latin-America expedition ( 1799-1804 ) . There are some people who still believe El Dorado is yet to be found . Other fictional cities appear as settings or subjects in literature , movies and video games . Most superhero and secret agent comics and some thrillers use fictional cities as backdrops , although most of these cities exist only for a single story , episode or an issue of a comic book . There are notable exceptions , such as Metropolis and Smallville in Superman , Gotham City in Batman , Stephen King 's Castle Rock and Emerald City which appears throughout Frank L. Baum 's Oz Books and appears in several film adaptations and animated films .",
  "/wiki/Prehistoric": "Human prehistory is the period between the use of the first stone tools c. 3.3 million years ago by hominins and the invention of writing systems . The earliest writing systems appeared c. 5,300 years ago , but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted , and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until the present . The end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places , and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently . Sumer in Mesopotamia , the Indus valley civilization , and ancient Egypt were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts and to keep historical records ; this took place already during the early Bronze Age . Neighboring civilizations were the first to follow . Most other civilizations reached the end of prehistory during the Iron Age . The three-age system of division of prehistory into the Stone Age , followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age , remains in use for much of Eurasia and North Africa , but is not generally used in those parts of the world where the working of hard metals arrived abruptly with contact with Eurasian cultures , such as the Americas , Oceania , Australasia and much of Sub-Saharan Africa . These areas also , with some exceptions in Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas , did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians , and their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods ; for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the prehistory of Australia . The period when a culture is written about by others , but has not developed its own writing is often known as the protohistory of the culture . By definition , there are no written records from human prehistory , so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial . Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century . This article is concerned with human prehistory , the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared until the beginning of recorded history .",
  "/wiki/Animation": "Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images . In traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . Today , most animations are made with computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings . Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets or clay figures . Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other . The illusion - as in motion pictures in general - is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement , but the exact causes are still uncertain . Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the ph\u00e9nakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope and film . Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally . For display on the computer , techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . Animation is more pervasive than many people realize . Apart from short films , feature films , animated GIF 's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images , animation is also prevalent in video games , motion graphics , user interfaces and visual effects .",
  "/wiki/Television_series": "A television show ( often simply TV show ) is any content produced for broadcast via over-the-air , satellite , cable , or internet and typically viewed on a television set , excluding breaking news , advertisements , or trailers that are typically placed between shows . Television shows are most often scheduled well ahead of time and appear on electronic guides or other TV listings . A television show might also be called a television program ( British English : programme ) , especially if it lacks a narrative structure . A television series is usually released in episodes that follow a narrative , and are usually divided into seasons ( US and Canada ) or series ( UK ) - yearly or semiannual sets of new episodes . A show with a limited number of episodes may be called a miniseries , serial , or limited series . A one-time show may be called a special . A television film ( made-for-TV movie or television movie ) is a film that is initially broadcast on television rather than released in theaters or direct-to-video . Television shows can be viewed as they are broadcast in real time ( live ) , be recorded on home video or a digital video recorder for later viewing , or be viewed on demand via a set-top box or streamed over the internet .",
