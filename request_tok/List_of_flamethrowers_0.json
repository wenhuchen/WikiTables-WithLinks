  "/wiki/Nazi_Germany": "Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945 , when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) controlled the country through a dictatorship . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law . The government was not a coordinated , co-operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour . In the midst of the Great Depression , the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy .",

  "/wiki/German_Empire": "The German Empire ( German : Deutsches Kaiserreich , officially Deutsches Reich ) , sometimes referred to as Imperial Germany , was the German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 . It was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states , except for Austria , joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I , King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern . Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million . A heavily rural collection of states in 1815 , the now united Germany became predominantly urban .

It was fought from September 26 , 1918 , until the Armistice of November 11 , 1918 , a total of 47 days . The Meuse-Argonne offensive was the largest in United States military history , involving 1.2 million American soldiers . It is the second deadliest battle in American history , resulting in over 350,000 casualties including 28,000 German lives , 26,277 American lives and an unknown number of French lives . U.S. losses were worsened by the inexperience of many of the troops , the tactics used during the early phases of the operation and the widespread onset of the global influenza outbreak called the Spanish Flu . Meuse-Argonne was the principal engagement of the American Expeditionary Force ( AEF ) during World War I . It was one of a series of Allied attacks known as the Hundred Days Offensive , which brought the war to an end .

The firing device is activated at the same time with the Selbstschlussventil and is inside the protective pipe . The Flammenwerfer 35 was produced until 1941 , when the lighter , slightly redesigned Flammenwerfer 41 began replacing it .",
  "/wiki/Flammenwerfer_41": "The Flammenwerfer 41 , or FmW 41 ( literally , flame thrower ) was the standard German flamethrower beginning in 1941 and an upgraded version of the earlier Flammenwerfer 35 . It was designed to clear enemy trenches and buildings in highly fortified areas . The Flammenwerfer 35 had been a long needed update on a World War I version simplifying the weapon to a single operating from three and increasing its range . However the 36 kg system was cumbersome to carry and difficult to use . Thus spurred the development of the FmW 41 . Similar to many other designs of the time , the FmW 41 used a hydrogen torch to ignite a tar and petrol mixture which was fired from a hand-held torch attached to a tank . The petrol and propellant were carried in separate tanks carried on the back which held 11.8 litres ( 2.6 imp gal ; 3.1 US gal ) of tar and petrol mixture called Flamm\u00f6l 19 . The FmW 41 proved to be more reliable and easier to operate than its predecessor , it had an increased range of 32 metres ( 105 ft ) . and was lighter weighing in at 28.7 kilograms ( 63 lb ) . Problems surfaced against Soviet troops during the winter of 1941 as its lighting mechanism was unable to cope with the cold weather conditions . Later versions of the weapon replaced the hydrogen torch with a cartridge based system which proved more effective . Flamethrower troops are often targeted by enemy troops as they take a heavy psychological toll on enemy morale in addition to being effective weapons against well entrenched enemy troops .",
  "/wiki/Handflammpatrone": "The Handflammpatrone DM34 Cartridge Launcher model HAFLA-35L ( hand-held flame-cartridge ) was a single-shot , disposable incendiary weapon issued to the German Armed Forces from 1976 to 2001 . Manufactured by Buck KG . An earlier version HAFLA-35 had been in service from 1965 . The weapon consisted of three compressed sections of incendiary red phosphorus contained in a projectile with a time fuse and bursting/scattering charge . The cartridge was held in an aluminium launch tube , externally reinforced with pasteboard . A pivoting handgrip with safety button , a primer and initial propelling charge are at one end of this tube , the other end with the cartridge being sealed with a plastic cover , making a watertight unit . The firing mechanism is locked until the safety button is pressed and the handle unfolded , an act that exposes the trigger and releases a safety mechanism . When the trigger is pulled , the primer ignites the initial propelling charge , setting the red phosphorus round in motion . Immediately a second propelling charge at the back of the cartridge accelerates the round out of the tube and also initiates a delay fuse . The round would either shatter on hard contact by kinetic energy alone after travelling at least 8 metres , spreading the incendiary content over a 5 to 8 metre area ( in this case the scattering charge does not explode ) , or if fired into the air over enemy dispositions , the cartridge would be burst by a scattering charge after 1.3 seconds of flight ( this represents forward travel of 70-80 m ) , the scattering charge being ignited by the delay fuse . The heat of the bursting charge and friction through the air changes the red phosphorus to white phosphorus which then self-ignites as it spreads . When burst in flight , the incendiary material spreads across an area approximately 10 m wide and 15 m long and burns at 1,300 \u00b0C .",
  "/wiki/West_Germany": "West Germany was the informal name for the Federal Republic of Germany , a country in Western Europe , in the period between its formation on 23 May 1949 and German reunification on 3 October 1990 . During this Cold War period , the western portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc . The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate . Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1952 , and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 .",

  "/wiki/Creosote": "Creosote is a category of carbonaceous chemicals formed by the distillation of various tars and pyrolysis of plant-derived material , such as wood or fossil fuel . They are typically used as preservatives or antiseptics . Some creosote types were used historically as a treatment for components of seagoing and outdoor wood structures to prevent rot ( e.g. , bridgework and railroad ties , see image ) . Samples may be found commonly inside chimney flues , where the coal or wood burns under variable conditions , producing soot and tarry smoke . Creosotes are the principal chemicals responsible for the stability , scent , and flavor characteristic of smoked meat ; the name is derived from Greek \u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 ( kreas ) , meaning 'meat ' , and \u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 ( s\u014dt\u0113r ) , meaning 'preserver ' . The two main kinds recognized in industry are coal-tar creosote and wood-tar creosote . The coal-tar variety , having stronger and more toxic properties , has chiefly been used as a preservative for wood ; coal-tar creosote was also formerly used as an escharotic , to burn malignant skin tissue , and in dentistry , to prevent necrosis , before its carcinogenic properties became known . [ citation needed ] The wood-tar variety has been used for meat preservation , ship treatment , and such medical purposes as an anaesthetic , antiseptic , astringent , expectorant , and laxative , though these have mostly been replaced by modern formulations .

  "/wiki/Nitrogen": "Nitrogen is the chemical element with the symbol N and atomic number 7 . It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 . Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time , Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first . The name nitrog\u00e8ne was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 , when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates . Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote , from the Greek \u1f00\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 no life , as it is an asphyxiant gas ; this name is instead used in many languages , such as French , Russian , Romanian and Turkish , and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine , azides and azo compounds . Nitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table , often called the pnictogens . The name comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd to choke , directly referencing nitrogen 's asphyxiating properties . It is a common element in the universe , estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System . At standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dinitrogen , a colourless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula N2 . Dinitrogen forms about 78% of Earth 's atmosphere , making it the most abundant uncombined element . Nitrogen occurs in all organisms , primarily in amino acids ( and thus proteins ) , in the nucleic acids ( DNA and RNA ) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate . The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass , the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen , carbon , and hydrogen .",

Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .",

The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the German forces from Poland ahead of the Soviet advance . While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city , the Red Army temporarily halted combat operations , enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to destroy the city in retaliation . The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support . It was the single largest military effort taken by any European resistance movement during World War II . The Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide Operation Tempest , launched at the time of the Soviet Lublin-Brest Offensive . The main Polish objectives were to drive the Germans out of Warsaw while helping the Allies defeat Germany . An additional , political goal of the Polish Underground State was to liberate Poland 's capital and assert Polish sovereignty before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation could assume control . Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German round-ups of able-bodied Poles for evacuation ; calls by Radio Moscow 's Polish Service for uprising ; and an emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five years of German occupation . Initially , the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw , but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to make radio contact with them and did not advance beyond the city limits . Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued . By 14 September , the eastern bank of the Vistula River opposite the Polish resistance positions was taken over by the Polish troops fighting under the Soviet command ; 1,200 men made it across the river , but they were not reinforced by the Red Army .",

With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia .

Napalm B is the more modern version of napalm ( utilizing styrene derivatives ) and , although distinctly different in its chemical composition , is often referred to simply as napalm . A team led by chemist Louis Fieser originally developed napalm for the United States Chemical Warfare Service in 1942 in a secret laboratory at Harvard University . Of immediate first interest was its viability as an incendiary device to be used in fire bombing campaigns during World War II and its potential to be coherently projected into a solid stream that would carry for distance ( instead of the bloomy fireball of pure gasoline ) resulted in widespread adoption in infantry/combat engineer flamethrowers as well . Napalm burns at the same temperature as gasoline , and for a greater duration , as well as being more easily dispersed and sticking tenaciously to its targets ; these traits make it extremely effective ( and controversial ) in the anti-structure and antipersonnel role . It has been widely used in both the air and ground role , with the largest used to date being via air-dropped bombs in World War II ( most notably in the devastating incendiary attacks on Japanese cities in 1945 ) , and later close air support roles in Korea and Vietnam . Napalm also has fueled most of the flamethrowers ( tank , ship and infantry-based ) used since World War II , giving them much greater range , and was used in this role as a common weapon of urban combat by both the Axis and the Allies in World War II . Multiple nations ( including the United States , China , Russia , Iran and North Korea ) maintain large stockpiles of napalm-based weapons of various types . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/M2_flamethrower": "The M2 flamethrower was an American man-portable backpack flamethrower that was used in World War II . It was the successor to the M1 and M1A1 flamethrowers . Although its burn time was only around 7 seconds and the flame was only effective out to around 20-40 meters , it was still a useful weapon . However , with the arrival of flamethrower tanks , the need for flamethrower-carrying infantrymen to expose themselves to enemy fire was greatly reduced . Though some M2s were sold off , the majority were scrapped when they were declared obsolete .",
  "/wiki/Vietnam_War": "The Vietnam War ( Vietnamese : Chi\u1ebfn tranh Vi\u1ec7t Nam ) , also known as the Second Indochina War , and in Vietnam as the Resistance War Against America ( Vietnamese : Kh\u00e1ng chi\u1ebfn ch\u1ed1ng M\u1ef9 ) or simply the American War , was a conflict in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 [ A 1 ] to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975 . It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam . North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet Union , China , and other communist allies ; South Vietnam was supported by the United States , South Korea , the Philippines , Australia , Thailand and other anti-communist allies . The war , considered a Cold War-era proxy war by some , lasted 19 years , with direct U.S. involvement ending in 1973 , and included the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War , which ended with all three countries becoming communist in 1975 . The conflict emerged from the First Indochina War against the communist-led Viet Minh . [ A 4 ] Most of the funding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S. After the French quit Indochina in 1954 , the US assumed financial and military support for the South Vietnamese state . The Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng , also known as Front national de lib\u00e9ration du Sud-Vi\u00eat Nam or NLF ( the National Liberation Front ) , a South Vietnamese common front under the direction of North Vietnam , initiated a guerrilla war in the south .

  "/wiki/Marsden_flamethrower": "The Petroleum Warfare Department ( PWD ) was an organisation established in Britain in 1940 in response to the invasion crisis during World War II , when it appeared that Germany would invade the country . The department was initially tasked with developing the uses of petroleum as a weapon of war and it oversaw the introduction of a wide range of flame warfare weapons . Later in the war , the department was instrumental in the creation of the Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation ( commonly known as FIDO ) that cleared runways of fog allowing the landing of aircraft returning from bombing raids over Germany in poor visibility ; and Operation Pluto which installed prefabricated fuel pipelines between England and France soon after the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944 .",
  "/wiki/ROKS_flamethrowers": "The ROKS-2 and ROKS-3 were man-portable flamethrowers used by the USSR in the Second World War . The ROKS-2 was designed not to draw attention so the fuel and gas tanks were concealed under a sheet-metal outer casting that resembled knapsack ; the flame projector was designed to resemble a standard Mosin-Nagant rifle . The purpose of this was to prevent the operator from being specifically targeted by the enemy . The flame shots were ignited by firing specially modified 7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev cartridges . The ROKS-2 was used , amongst other engagements , during the close-range fighting during the first days of the Battle of Kursk in 1943 . The ROKS-3 was a simplified model that was designed to be easier to manufacture . It did away with the disguise for the backpack , though it retained the flame projector designed to resemble a rifle . Both models carried around 9 litres ( 2.4 US gal ) of fuel . The fuel was propelled by nitrogen gas pressurized at 115 bars ( 11,500 kPa ) and , under ideal circumstances , had a maximum range of around 45 metres ( 49 yd ) } . The Finnish designation for captured ROKS-2 units was liekinheitin M/41-r . Captured Soviet flamethrowers saw some use by Finnish forces during the Continuation War . They were operated by two-man teams of combat engineers .",

  "/wiki/Empire_of_Japan": "The Empire of Japan ( \u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u570b , Dai Nippon Teikoku , literally Empire of Great Japan ) was the historical nation-state [ nb 2 ] and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan . Japan 's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan Fukoku Ky\u014dhei ( \u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175 , Enrich the Country , Strengthen her Armed Forces ) and Shokusan K\u014dgy\u014d ( \u6b96\u7523\u8208\u696d , Promote Industry ) led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire following the First Sino-Japanese War , the Boxer Rebellion , the Russo-Japanese War , and World War I . Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War . However , after many Allied victories and following the Soviet Union 's declaration of war against Japan on August 9 , 1945 , and subsequent invasion of Manchuria and other territories , and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Empire surrendered to the Allies on August 15 , 1945 . A period of occupation by the Allies followed . In 1947 , with American involvement , a new constitution was enacted , officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end . Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952 , eventually forming the current constitutional monarchy known as Japan . The Emperors during this time , which spanned the entire Meiji , Taish\u014d , and the lesser part of the Sh\u014dwa era , are now known in Japan by their posthumous names , which coincide with those era names : Emperor Meiji ( Mutsuhito ) , Emperor Taish\u014d ( Yoshihito ) , and Emperor Sh\u014dwa ( Hirohito ) .",

It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Ministry of the Army , both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy . Later an Inspectorate General of Aviation became the third agency with oversight of the army . During wartime or national emergencies , the nominal command functions of the emperor would be centralized in an Imperial General Headquarters ( IGHQ ) , an ad-hoc body consisting of the chief and vice chief of the Army General Staff , the Minister of the Army , the chief and vice chief of the Naval General Staff , the Inspector General of Aviation , and the Inspector General of Military Training .",

The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ( JMSDF ) was formed circa 1952-1954 after the dissolution of the IJN . The Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest navy in the world by 1920 , behind the Royal Navy and the United States Navy ( USN ) . It was supported by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet . It was the primary opponent of the Western Allies in the Pacific War . The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy go back to early interactions with nations on the Asian continent , beginning in the early medieval period and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of cultural exchange with European powers during the Age of Discovery . After two centuries of stagnation during the country 's ensuing seclusion policy under the sh\u014dgun of the Edo period , Japan 's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by American intervention in 1854 . This eventually led to the Meiji Restoration . Accompanying the re-ascendance of the Emperor came a period of frantic modernization and industrialization . The navy had several successes , sometimes against much more powerful enemies such as in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War , before being largely destroyed in World War II .",

  "/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War": "The Second Sino-Japanese War was a military conflict that was primarily waged between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan from July 7 , 1937 , to September 2 , 1945 . It began with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 in which a dispute between Japanese and Chinese troops escalated into a battle . Some sources in the modern People 's Republic of China date the beginning of the war to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 . It is known as the War of Resistance ( Chinese : \u4e2d\u56fd\u6297\u65e5\u6218\u4e89 ; pinyin : Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 K\u00e0ngr\u00ec Zh\u00e0nzh\u0113ng ; lit . Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan ) in China . China fought Japan with aid from the Soviet Union and the United States . After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 , the war merged with other conflicts of World War II as a major sector known as the China Burma India Theater . Some scholars consider the start of the full-scale Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to have been the beginning of World War II . The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century . It accounted for the majority of civilian and military casualties in the Pacific War , with between 10 and 25 million Chinese civilians and over 4 million Chinese and Japanese military personnel dying from war-related violence , famine , and other causes . The war has been called the Asian holocaust . The war was the result of a decades-long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw material reserves , food , and labor .",
  "/wiki/Wechselapparat": "The Germans introduced a small flamethrower in 1916 to replace the earlier Kleif . The Wechselapparat ( Wex ) had a doughnut-shaped backpack fuel container with a spherical propellant container in the middle . This design was updated before the Second World War to become flamethrower model 35 . However , model 35 was considered too fragile so it was soon replaced by the model 41 , a simpler construction with smaller , horizontal , cylindrical backpack containers . The doughnut-shaped container design was copied by the British during World War II as the Flamethrower , Portable , No 2 . Wechselapparat is German for exchange apparatus ."
