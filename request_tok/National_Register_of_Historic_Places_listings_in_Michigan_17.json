  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock , formed as rock strata called coal seams . Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements ; chiefly hydrogen , sulfur , oxygen , and nitrogen . Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years . Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands - called coal forests - that covered much of the Earth 's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) and Permian times . As a fossil fuel burned for heat , coal supplies about a quarter of the world 's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity . Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal . The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness . The coal industry damages the environment , including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide , 14 gigatonne ( Gt ) in 2016 , which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions . As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal , and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020 . To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C ( 3.6 \u00b0F ) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 . The largest consumer and importer of coal is China . China mines almost half the world 's coal , followed by India with about a tenth .",
  "/wiki/Ferry": "A ferry is a merchant vessel used to carry passengers , and sometimes vehicles and cargo , across a body of water . A passenger ferry with many stops , such as in Venice , Italy , is sometimes called a water bus or water taxi . Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands , allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels . Ship connections of much larger distances ( such as over long distances in water bodies like the Mediterranean Sea ) may also be called ferry services , especially if they carry vehicles .",
  "/wiki/Lake_Michigan": "Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America . It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume ( 1,180 cu mi ( 4,900 km3 ) ) and the third-largest by surface area ( 22,404 sq mi ( 58,030 km2 ) ) , after Lake Superior and Lake Huron ( and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia ) . To the east , its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the narrow Straits of Mackinac , giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart ; the two are technically a single lake . Lake Michigan is the only one of the Great Lakes located entirely within the territory of the United States . It is shared , from west to east , by the U.S. states of Wisconsin , Illinois , Indiana , and Michigan . Ports along its shores include Chicago ; Milwaukee ; Green Bay , Wisconsin ; Gary , Indiana ; and Muskegon , Michigan . The word Michigan originally referred to the lake itself , and is believed to come from the Ojibwe word michi-gami meaning great water .",
  "/wiki/Great_Lakes": "The Great Lakes ( French : les Grands Lacs ) , also called the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Great Lakes of North America , are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America , on the Canada-United States border , which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River . They comprise Lakes Superior , Michigan , Huron , Erie , and Ontario . Hydrologically , there are only four lakes , because Lakes Michigan and Huron join at the Straits of Mackinac . The lakes form the Great Lakes Waterway . The Great Lakes are the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth by total area , and second-largest by total volume , containing 21% of the world 's surface fresh water by volume . The total surface is 94,250 square miles ( 244,106 km2 ) , and the total volume ( measured at the low water datum ) is 5,439 cubic miles ( 22,671 km3 ) , slightly less than the volume of Lake Baikal ( 5,666 cu mi or 23,615 km3 , 22-23% of the world 's surface fresh water ) . Due to their sea-like characteristics ( rolling waves , sustained winds , strong currents , great depths , and distant horizons ) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as inland seas . Lake Superior is the second-largest lake in the world by area , and the largest freshwater lake by area . Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country . The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around 14,000 years ago , as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater . The lakes have been a major source for transportation , migration , trade , and fishing , serving as a habitat to many aquatic species in a region with much biodiversity . The surrounding region is called the Great Lakes region , which includes the Great Lakes Megalopolis .",
  "/wiki/Rail_car_ferry": "A train ferry is a ship ( ferry ) designed to carry railway vehicles .

In the United States , train ferries are sometimes referred to as car ferries , as distinguished from auto ferries used to transport automobiles . The wharf ( sometimes called a slip ) has a ramp , and a linkspan or apron , balanced by weights , that connects the railway proper to the ship , allowing for the water level to rise and fall with the tides . While railway vehicles can be and are shipped on the decks or in the holds of ordinary ships , purpose-built train ferries can be quickly loaded and unloaded by roll-on/roll-off , especially as several vehicles can be loaded or unloaded at once . A train ferry that is a barge is called a car float or rail barge .",

They are one of the Anishinaabeg , related to but distinct from the Ojibwe and Potawatomi peoples . After migrating from the East Coast in ancient times , they settled on Manitoulin Island , near the northern shores of Lake Huron , and the Bruce Peninsula in the present-day province of Ontario , Canada . They considered this their original homeland . After the 17th century , they also settled along the Ottawa River , and in the states of Michigan and Wisconsin , as well as through the Midwest south of the Great Lakes in the latter country .

  "/wiki/Mascouten": "The Mascouten ( also Mascoutin , Mathkoutench , Muscoden , or Musketoon ) were a tribe of Algonquian-speaking Native Americans located in the Midwest . They are believed to have dwelt on both sides of the Mississippi River , adjacent to the present-day Wisconsin-Illinois border , after being driven out of Michigan by the Odawa . The accounts of the Jesuit Relations frequently refer to the Mascouten as the Fire Nation or Nation of Fire . One Jesuit writes : The Fire Nation is erroneously so called , its correct name being Maskoutench , which means a treeless country , like that inhabited by these people ; but as , by changing a few letters , this Word is made to signify fire , therefore the people have come to be called the Fire Nation . Their name apparently comes either from a Fox word meaning Little Prairie People or from the Sauk term Mashkot\u00eawi ( Prairie ) or Mashkot\u00eawineniwa ( Plains Indians ) and shkot\u00eawi ( fire ) which would fit the Jesuits statement . Historians do not know what they called themselves ( autonym ) .The Huron knew them also as Atsistaeronnon ( people of the fire ) . They are first mentioned in historic records by French missionaries , who described the people as inhabiting the southern area of present-day Michigan . The missionaries reported the Mascouten as being more populous than all the Neutral Nation , the Huron , and the Iroquois nations , put together . In 1712 , the Mascouten united with the Kickapoo and the Fox , after almost being exterminated by the French and the Potawatomi . Survivors migrated westward . The Mascouten are last referred to as a band in historic records in 1779 , when they were living on the Wabash River ( in present-day Indiana ) with peoples of the Piankashaw and the Kickapoo . The surviving Mascouten are noted in United States records of 1813 and 1825 as being part of the Kickapoo Prairie Band .",
