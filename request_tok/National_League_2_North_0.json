Historically , Wirral was wholly within Cheshire ; in the Domesday Book , its border with the rest of the county was placed at two arrow falls from Chester city walls . However , since the passing of the Local Government Act 1972 , only the southern third has been in Cheshire , with the rest in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in the modern county of Merseyside , which is part of the Liverpool City Region .

It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary and comprises five metropolitan boroughs : Knowsley , St Helens , Sefton , Wirral , and the city of Liverpool . Merseyside , which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , takes its name from the River Mersey . Merseyside spans 249 square miles ( 645 km2 ) of land which border Lancashire ( to the north-east ) , Greater Manchester ( to the east ) , Cheshire ( to the south and south-east ) and the Irish Sea to the west . North Wales is across the Dee Estuary . There is a mix of high density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Merseyside , but overwhelmingly the land use is urban . It has a focused central business district , formed by Liverpool City Centre , but Merseyside is also a polycentric county with five metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . The Liverpool Urban Area is the fifth most populous conurbation in England , and dominates the geographic centre of the county , while the smaller Birkenhead Urban Area dominates the Wirral Peninsula in the south . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Merseyside County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) are now effectively unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and several county-wide services are co-ordinated by authorities and joint-boards , such as Merseytravel ( for public transport ) , Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the Merseyside Police ( for law-enforcement ) ; as a ceremonial county , Merseyside has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . As the Lancashire county palatine boundaries remain the same as the historic boundaries , the High Sheriff of Merseyside , along with those of Lancashire and Greater Manchester are appointed within the Duchy and County Palatine of Lancaster .",

The league was one of the most competitive for years , with promotion and relegation not decided until the very last round . In terms of the championship , at one point it looked like four teams could go on to win it , but in the end it was a two horse race between Ampthill and Old Elthamians . The real decider was when Ampthill won 36-6 at home over Old Elthamians on the 3rd March 2019 , but they still had to keep their head for the remaining five games as Old Elthamians pushed them all the way , eventually claiming the title on 27 April 2019 when they won 52-20 away to Loughborough Students . Ampthill would be promoted to the 2019-20 RFU Championship - the highest level the club had reached - where they could enjoy derby games at Bedford Blues . The relegation battle was also hotly contested , with all three sides going down on the last day of the season . Loughborough Students had barely escaped relegation the previous year but after a poor first half of the season , they started to rally and gain some victories , helped by their try bonus record which was one of the best in the league , and looked at one point that they might do it yet again . However , defeats in their last two games against Plymouth Albion and champions , Ampthill , condemned them to the drop as the bottom ranked side in the division . They were joined by Esher ( 15th ) , who went down despite a valiant win away to Blackheath , and Caldy ( 14th ) , who were relegated after losing to Birmingham Moseley , finishing just 2 points shy of 13th place Cambridge , who had an excellent away win to Sale FC to thank for keeping them up . Loughborough and Caldy would drop to the 2019-20 National League 2 North while Esher would fall to the 2019-20 National League 2 South . For Esher demotion to level 4 will make it the lowest level they have played at since the 1999-00 season .",
