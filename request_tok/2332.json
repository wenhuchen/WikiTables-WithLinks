  "/wiki/Arado_Ar_234": "The Arado Ar 234 Blitz ( English : lightning ) was the world 's first operational jet-powered bomber , built by the German Arado company in the closing stages of World War II . Produced in limited numbers it was used almost entirely in the reconnaissance role . In its few uses as a bomber it proved to be nearly impossible to intercept . It was the last Luftwaffe aircraft to fly over the UK during the war , in April 1945 .",
  "/wiki/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress": "The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engined heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) . Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers , the Boeing entry ( prototype Model 299/XB-17 ) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps ' performance specifications . Although Boeing lost the contract ( to the Douglas B-18 Bolo ) because the prototype crashed , the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation . From its introduction in 1938 , the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances , becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time , behind the four-engined B-24 and the multirole , twin-engined Ju 88 . The B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets . The United States Eighth Air Force , based at many airfields in central , eastern and southern England , and the Fifteenth Air Force , based in Italy , complemented the RAF Bomber Command 's nighttime area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive to help secure air superiority over the cities , factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944 . The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the War in the Pacific , early in World War II , where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields . From its prewar inception , the USAAC ( by June 1941 , the USAAF ) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon ; it was a relatively fast , high-flying , long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload . It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base . The B-17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II . Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft , over 640,000 tons were dropped from B-17s . In addition to its role as a bomber , the B-17 was also employed as a transport , antisubmarine aircraft , drone controller , and search-and-rescue aircraft .",
  "/wiki/Consolidated_B-24_Liberator": "The Consolidated B-24 Liberator is an American heavy bomber , designed by Consolidated Aircraft of San Diego , California . It was known within the company as the Model 32 , and some initial production aircraft were laid down as export models designated as various LB-30s , in the Land Bomber design category . At its inception , the B-24 was a modern design featuring a highly efficient shoulder-mounted , high aspect ratio Davis wing . The wing gave the Liberator a high cruise speed , long range and the ability to carry a heavy bomb load . Early RAF Liberators were the first aircraft to cross the Atlantic Ocean as a matter of routine . In comparison with its contemporaries , the B-24 was relatively difficult to fly and had poor low-speed performance ; it also had a lower ceiling and was less robust than the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress . While aircrews tended to prefer the B-17 , General Staff favored the B-24 and procured it in huge numbers for a wide variety of roles . At approximately 18,500 units - including 8,685 manufactured by Ford Motor Company - it holds records as the world 's most produced bomber , heavy bomber , multi-engine aircraft , and American military aircraft in history . The B-24 was used extensively in World War II . It served in every branch of the American armed forces as well as several Allied air forces and navies . It saw use in every theater of operations . Along with the B-17 , the B-24 was the mainstay of the US strategic bombing campaign in the Western European theater .",
  "/wiki/De_Havilland_Mosquito": "The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito is a British twin-engined , shoulder-winged multirole combat aircraft , introduced during the Second World War . Unusual in that its frame is constructed mostly of wood , it was nicknamed the Wooden Wonder , or Mossie . Lord Beaverbrook , Minister of Aircraft Production , nicknamed it Freeman 's Folly , alluding to Air Chief Marshal Sir Wilfrid Freeman , who defended Geoffrey de Havilland and his design concept against orders to scrap the project . In 1941 , it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world . Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber , the Mosquito 's use evolved during the war into many roles , including low- to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber , high-altitude night bomber , pathfinder , day or night fighter , fighter-bomber , intruder , maritime strike , and photo-reconnaissance aircraft . It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation as a fast transport to carry small , high-value cargo to and from neutral countries through enemy-controlled airspace . The crew of two , pilot and navigator , sat side by side . A single passenger could ride in the aircraft 's bomb bay when necessary . The Mosquito FBVI was often flown in special raids , such as Operation Jericho - an attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944 , and precision attacks against military intelligence , security , and police facilities ( such as Gestapo headquarters ) . On 30 January 1943 , the 10th anniversary of the Nazis ' seizure of power , a morning Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while Hermann G\u00f6ring was speaking , putting his speech off the air . The Mosquito flew with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and other air forces in the European , Mediterranean and Italian theatres . The Mosquito was also operated by the RAF in the Southeast Asian theatre and by the Royal Australian Air Force based in the Halmaheras and Borneo during the Pacific War .",
  "/wiki/Dornier_Do_17": "The Dornier Do 17 , sometimes referred to as the Fliegender Bleistift ( flying pencil ) , is a light bomber of Nazi Germany during World War II . It was produced by Claudius Dornier 's company , Dornier Flugzeugwerke . The aircraft was designed as a Schnellbomber ( fast bomber ) , a light bomber which , in theory , would be so fast that it could outrun defending fighter aircraft . The Dornier was designed with two engines mounted on a shoulder wing structure and possessed a twin tail fin configuration . The type was popular among its crews due to its handling , especially at low altitude , which made the Do 17 harder to hit than other German bombers . Designed in the early 1930s , it was one of the three main Luftwaffe bomber types used in the first three years of the war . The Do 17 made its combat debut in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War , operating in the Condor Legion in various roles . Along with the Heinkel He 111 it was the main bomber type of the German air arm in 1939-1940 . The Dornier was used throughout the early war , and saw action in significant numbers in every major campaign theatre as a front line aircraft until the end of 1941 , when its effectiveness and usage was curtailed as its bomb load and range were limited . Production of the Dornier ended in mid-1940 , in favour of the newer and more powerful Junkers Ju 88 . The successor of the Do 17 was the much more powerful Dornier Do 217 , which started to appear in strength in 1942 . Even so , the Do 17 continued service in the Luftwaffe in various roles until the end of the war , as a glider tug , research and trainer aircraft .",
  "/wiki/Dornier_Do_215": "The Dornier Do 215 was a light bomber , aerial reconnaissance aircraft and later a night fighter , produced by Dornier originally for export , but in the event most served in the Luftwaffe . Like its predecessor , the Dornier Do 17 , it inherited the title The Flying Pencil because of its slim fuselage . The successor of the Do 215 was the Do 217 .",
  "/wiki/Dornier_Do_217": "The Dornier Do 217 was a bomber used by the German Luftwaffe during World War II as a more powerful development of the Dornier Do 17 , known as the Fliegender Bleistift ( German : flying pencil ) . Designed in 1937 and 1938 as a heavy bomber but not meant to be capable of the longer-range missions envisioned for the larger Heinkel He 177 , the Do 217 's design was refined during 1939 and production began in late 1940 . It entered service in early 1941 and by the beginning of 1942 was available in significant numbers . The Dornier Do 217 had a much larger bomb load capacity and had much greater range than the Do 17 . In later variants , dive bombing and maritime strike capabilities using glide bombs were experimented with , considerable success being achieved . Early Do 217 variants were more powerful than the contemporary Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88 , having a greater speed , range and bomb load . Owing to this it was called a heavy bomber rather than a medium bomber . The Do 217 served on all fronts in all roles . On the Eastern Front and Western Front it operated as a strategic bomber , torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft . It also performed tactical operations , either direct ground assault or anti-shipping strikes during the Battle of the Atlantic and Battle of Normandy . The Do 217 was also converted to become a night fighter and saw considerable action in the Defence of the Reich campaign until late in the war . The type also served in anti-shipping units in the Mediterranean , attacking Allied convoys and naval units during the Battle of the Mediterranean .",

It served with several Allied air forces , principally the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) , the Soviet Air Forces ( VVS ) , Soviet Naval Aviation ( AVMF ) , and the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) of the United Kingdom . A total of 7,478 aircraft were built , of which more than a third served with Soviet units . It was also used by the air forces of Australia , South Africa , France , and the Netherlands during the war , and by Brazil afterwards . In most British Commonwealth air forces , the bomber variants were named Boston , while the night fighter and intruder variants were named Havoc . The exception was the Royal Australian Air Force , which used the name Boston for all variants . The USAAF used the P-70 designation to refer to the night fighter variants .",
  "/wiki/Fiat_CR.25": "The Fiat CR.25 was an Italian twin-engine reconnaissance-bomber fighter aircraft which served in small numbers for the Regia Aeronautica during World War II . 40 CR.25s were ordered ( later reduced to ten , the two prototypes and other eight airplanes ) after the operative failure of the apparently more promising Breda Ba.88 bomber . Later , it was decided to use the CR.25 as a reconnaissance plane and as escort fighter , with a total of nine aircraft ( a prototype and the eight pre-production aircraft ) for this role . It was used during the war by the 173a Squadriglia Ricognizione Strategica Terrestre ( Strategic Land Reconnaissance Squadron ) , operating from Sicily . Despite positive reports from the pilots , and a proposal by Fiat to resume production , no further aircraft were produced . The prototype MM 332 , refurbished as personnel transport , was assigned to the Italian embassy in Berlin . )",
  "/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Fw_190": "The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 W\u00fcrger ( English : Shrike ) is a German single-seat , single-engine fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank in the late 1930s and widely used during World War II . Along with its well-known counterpart , the Messerschmitt Bf 109 , the Fw 190 became the backbone of the Luftwaffe 's Jagdwaffe ( Fighter Force ) . The twin-row BMW 801 radial engine that powered most operational versions enabled the Fw 190 to lift larger loads than the Bf 109 , allowing its use as a day fighter , fighter-bomber , ground-attack aircraft and , to a lesser degree , night fighter . The Fw 190A started flying operationally over France in August 1941 , and quickly proved superior in all but turn radius to the Royal Air Force 's main front-line fighter , the Spitfire Mk . V , particularly at low and medium altitudes . The 190 maintained superiority over Allied fighters until the introduction of the improved Spitfire Mk . IX . In November/December 1942 , the Fw 190 made its air combat debut on the Eastern Front , finding much success in fighter wings and specialised ground attack units called Schlachtgeschwader ( Battle Wings or Strike Wings ) from October 1943 onwards . The Fw 190A series ' performance decreased at high altitudes ( usually 6,000 m ( 20,000 ft ) and above ) , which reduced its effectiveness as a high-altitude interceptor . From the Fw 190 's inception , there had been ongoing efforts to address this with a turbosupercharged BMW 801 in the B model , the much longer-nosed C model with efforts to also turbocharge its chosen Daimler-Benz DB 603 inverted V12 powerplant , and the similarly long-nosed D model with the Junkers Jumo 213 . Problems with the turbocharger installations on the -B and -C subtypes meant only the D model entered service in September 1944 . These high-altitude developments eventually led to the Focke-Wulf Ta 152 , which was capable of extreme speeds at medium to high altitudes ( 755 km/h ( 408 kn ; 469 mph ) at 13,500 m ( 44,300 ft ) ) .",

The Ta 152 was a development of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 aircraft . It was intended to be made in at least three versions - the Ta 152H H\u00f6henj\u00e4ger ( high-altitude fighter ) , the Ta 152C designed for medium-altitude operations and ground-attack using a Daimler-Benz DB 603 and smaller wings , and the Ta 152E fighter-reconnaissance aircraft with the engine of the H model and the wing of the C model . The first Ta 152H entered service with the Luftwaffe in January 1945 . The Ta 152 was produced too late and in insufficient numbers to affect the outcome of the war .",

Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works ( JFM ) designed the plane in the mid-1930s as a so-called fast bomber that would be too fast for fighters of its era to intercept . It suffered from technical problems during its development and early operational periods but became one of the most versatile combat aircraft of the war . Like a number of other Luftwaffe bombers , it served as a bomber , dive bomber , night fighter , torpedo bomber , reconnaissance aircraft , heavy fighter and at the end of the war , as a flying bomb . Despite a protracted development , it became one of the Luftwaffe 's most important aircraft . The assembly line ran constantly from 1936 to 1945 and more than 15,000 Ju 88s were built in dozens of variants , more than any other twin-engine German aircraft of the period . Throughout production the basic structure of the aircraft remained unchanged .",

  "/wiki/Lockheed_P-38_Lightning": "The Lockheed P-38 Lightning is a World War II-era American piston-engined fighter aircraft . Developed for the United States Army Air Corps , the P-38 had distinctive twin booms and a central nacelle containing the cockpit and armament . Allied propaganda claimed it had been nicknamed the fork-tailed devil ( German : der Gabelschwanz-Teufel ) by the Luftwaffe and two planes , one pilot by the Japanese . Along with its use as a general fighter , the P-38 was utilized in various aerial combat roles including as a highly effective fighter-bomber , a night fighter , and as a long-range escort fighter when equipped with drop tanks . The P-38 was also used as a bomber-pathfinder , guiding streams of medium and heavy bombers ; or even other P-38s , equipped with bombs , to their targets . Used in the aerial reconnaissance role , the P-38 would account for 90 percent of the aerial film captured over Europe . The P-38 was used most successfully in the Pacific Theater of Operations and the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations as the aircraft of America 's top aces , Richard Bong ( 40 victories ) , Thomas McGuire ( 38 victories ) and Charles H. MacDonald ( 27 victories ) . In the South West Pacific theater , the P-38 was the primary long-range fighter of United States Army Air Forces until the introduction of large numbers of P-51D Mustangs toward the end of the war . Unusual for a fighter of this time , the exhaust was muffled by the turbo-superchargers , making the P-38 's operation relatively quiet . The two turbo-superchargers also provided the P-38 with good high-altitude performance , making it one of the earliest Allied fighters capable of performing at such altitudes . It was extremely forgiving and could be mishandled in many ways , but the rate of roll in the early versions was too low for it to excel as a dogfighter . The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in large-scale production throughout American involvement in the war , from Pearl Harbor to Victory over Japan Day .",
  "/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_109": "The Messerschmitt Bf 109 is a German World War II fighter aircraft that was , along with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 , the backbone of the Luftwaffe 's fighter force . The Bf 109 first saw operational service in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War and was still in service at the dawn of the jet age at the end of World War II in 1945 . It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era , including such features as all-metal monocoque construction , a closed canopy , and retractable landing gear . It was powered by a liquid-cooled , inverted-V12 aero engine . From the end of 1941 , the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 . It was commonly called the Me 109 , most often by Allied aircrew and among the German aces , even though this was not the official German designation . It was designed by Willy Messerschmitt and Robert Lusser who worked at Bayerische Flugzeugwerke during the early to mid-1930s . It was conceived as an interceptor , although later models were developed to fulfill multiple tasks , serving as bomber escort , fighter-bomber , day- , night- , all-weather fighter , ground-attack aircraft , and reconnaissance aircraft . It was supplied to several states during World War II , and served with several countries for many years after the war . The Bf 109 is the most produced fighter aircraft in history , with a total of 33,984 airframes produced from 1936 to April 1945 . The Bf 109 was flown by the three top-scoring German fighter aces of World War II , who claimed 928 victories among them while flying with Jagdgeschwader 52 , mainly on the Eastern Front . The highest-scoring fighter ace of all time was Erich Hartmann , who flew the Bf 109 and was credited with 352 aerial victories .",
  "/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_110": "The Messerschmitt Bf 110 , often known unofficially as the Me 110 , is a twin-engine Zerst\u00f6rer ( Destroyer , heavy fighter ) and fighter-bomber ( Jagdbomber or Jabo ) developed in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and used by the Luftwaffe during World War II . Hermann G\u00f6ring was a proponent of the Bf 110 . It was armed with two MG FF 20 mm cannon , four 7.92 mm ( .312 in ) MG 17 machine guns , and one 7.92 mm ( .312 in ) MG 15 machine gun ( later variants rear gunner station would be armed with the twin-barreled MG 81Z ) for defence . Development work on an improved type to replace the Bf 110 , the Messerschmitt Me 210 began before the war started but its teething troubles resulted in the Bf 110 soldiering on until the end of the war in various roles , with its replacements , the Me 210 and the significantly improved Me 410 Hornisse . The Bf 110 served with considerable success in the early campaigns in Poland , Norway and France . The primary weakness of the Bf 110 was its lack of maneuverability , although this could be mitigated with the correct tactics . This weakness was exploited when flying as close escort to German bombers during the Battle of Britain . However , research shows that during the Battle of Britain , the Bf 110 had a better victory-to-loss ratio than any other fighter in that battle . When British bombers began targeting German territory with nightly raids , some Bf 110-equipped units were converted to night fighters , a role to which the aircraft was well suited . After the Battle of Britain the Bf 110 enjoyed a successful period as an air superiority fighter and strike aircraft in other theatres and defended Germany from strategic air attack by day against the USAAF 's 8th Air Force , until an American change in fighter tactics rendered them increasingly vulnerable to developing American air supremacy over the Reich as 1944 began . During the Balkans and North African campaigns and on the Eastern Front , it rendered valuable ground support to the German Army as a potent fighter-bomber . Later in the war , it was developed into a formidable radar-equipped night fighter , becoming the main night-fighting aircraft of the Luftwaffe .",
  "/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_210": "The Messerschmitt Me 210 was a German heavy fighter and ground-attack aircraft of World War II . Design started before the war , as a replacement for the Bf 110 . The first examples were ready in 1939 , but they proved to have unacceptably poor flight characteristics due to serious wing planform and fuselage design flaws . A large-scale operational testing program throughout 1941 and early 1942 did not cure the type 's problems . The design entered limited service in 1943 , but was almost immediately replaced by the Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse ( Hornet ) . The Me 410 was a further development of the Me 210 , renamed so as to avoid the 210 's notoriety . The failure of the Me 210 's development program meant the Luftwaffe was forced to continue operating the Bf 110 after it had become outdated , despite mounting losses .",
  "/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262": "The Messerschmitt Me 262 , nicknamed Schwalbe ( German : Swallow ) in fighter versions , or Sturmvogel ( German : Storm Bird ) in fighter-bomber versions , was the world 's first operational jet-powered fighter aircraft . Design work started before World War II began , but problems with engines , metallurgy and top-level interference kept the aircraft from operational status with the Luftwaffe until mid-1944 . The Me 262 was faster and more heavily armed than any Allied fighter , including the British jet-powered Gloster Meteor . One of the most advanced aviation designs in operational use during World War II , the Me 262 's roles included light bomber , reconnaissance and experimental night fighter versions . Me 262 pilots claimed a total of 542 Allied aircraft shot down , although higher claims are sometimes made . [ Note 1 ] The Allies countered its effectiveness in the air by attacking the aircraft on the ground and during takeoff and landing . Strategic materials shortages and design compromises on the Junkers Jumo 004 axial-flow turbojet engines led to reliability problems . Attacks by Allied forces on fuel supplies during the deteriorating late-war situation also reduced the effectiveness of the aircraft as a fighting force . Armament production within Germany was focused on more easily manufactured aircraft . In the end , the Me 262 had a negligible impact on the course of the war as a result of its late introduction and the consequently small numbers put in operational service . While German use of the aircraft ended with the close of World War II , a small number were operated by the Czechoslovak Air Force until 1951 . It also heavily influenced several designs , such as Sukhoi Su-9 ( 1946 ) and Nakajima Kikka ."
