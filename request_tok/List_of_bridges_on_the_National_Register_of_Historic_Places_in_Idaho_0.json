  "/wiki/Boise_River_and_Canal_Bridge": "The Boise River and Canal Bridge , in Caldwell , Idaho , is a three-span , 390 ft ( 120 m ) Warren camelback through-truss design constructed in 1922 by the American Bridge Company from plans submitted by Caldwell city engineer Fred H. McConnel . The site is where Oregon Trail pioneers forded the Boise River . The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 . The Boise River and Canal Bridge replaced an earlier bridge known as the Canyon Hill Bridge , and when the new bridge was commissioned by Canyon County officials , it continued under the same name . Later , the bridge became known as Idaho Pacific Highway Bridge , Highway 30 Bridge , or Silver Bridge . The bridge road width , 19.5 ft ( 5.9 m ) , only allows for one automobile traffic lane , and vertical clearance is limited to 14.1 ft ( 4.3 m ) . These factors and that the bridge is beyond its functional lifespan have prompted Canyon County officials to consider refurbishing the Boise River and Canal Bridge as a pedestrian only bridge and building a new bridge for motorized traffic near the site .",

  "/wiki/Girder_bridge": "A girder bridge is a bridge that uses girders as the means of supporting its deck . The two most common types of modern steel girder bridge are plate and box . [ citation needed ] The term girder is often used interchangeably with beam in reference to bridge design . However , some authors define beam bridges slightly differently from girder bridges . A girder may be made of concrete or steel . Many shorter bridges , especially in rural areas where they may be exposed to water overtopping and corrosion , utilize concrete box girder . The term girder is typically used to refer to a steel beam . In a beam or girder bridge , the beams themselves are the primary support for the deck , and are responsible for transferring the load down to the foundation . Material type , shape , and weight all affect how much weight a beam can hold . Due to the properties of the second moment of area , the height of a girder is the most significant factor to affect its load capacity . Longer spans , more traffic , or wider spacing of the beams will all directly result in a deeper beam . In truss and arch-style bridges , the girders are still the main support for the deck , but the load is transferred through the truss or arch to the foundation ."
