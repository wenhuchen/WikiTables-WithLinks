  "/wiki/Coyote": "The coyote ( Canis latrans ) is a canine native to North America . It is smaller than its close relative , the gray wolf , and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf . It fills much of the same ecological niche as the golden jackal does in Eurasia , though it is larger and more predatory , and is sometimes called the American jackal by zoologists . Other names for the species , largely historical , include prairie wolf and brush wolf . The coyote is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout North America , southwards through Mexico , and into Central America . The species is versatile , able to adapt to and expand into environments modified by humans . It is enlarging its range , with coyotes moving into urban areas in the Eastern U.S. , and was sighted in eastern Panama ( across the Panama Canal from their home range ) for the first time in 2013 . 19 coyote subspecies are recognized . The average male weighs 8 to 20 kg ( 18 to 44 lb ) and the average female 7 to 18 kg ( 15 to 40 lb ) . Their fur color is predominantly light gray and red or fulvous interspersed with black and white , though it varies somewhat with geography . It is highly flexible in social organization , living either in a family unit or in loosely knit packs of unrelated individuals . Primarily carnivorous , its diet consists mainly of deer , rabbits , hares , rodents , birds , reptiles , amphibians , fish , and invertebrates , though it may also eat fruits and vegetables on occasion .",
  "/wiki/Canidae": "Canidae /\u02c8k\u00e6n\u026adi\u02d0/ ( from Latin , canis , dog ) is a biological family of dog-like carnivorans . A member of this family is called a canid . There are three subfamilies found within the canid family , which are the extinct Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae , and the extant Caninae . The Caninae are known as canines , which includes domestic dogs , wolves , foxes and other extant and extinct species . Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica , having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time . Canids vary in size from the 2-metre-long ( 6.6 ft ) gray wolf to the 24-centimetre-long ( 9.4 in ) fennec fox . The body forms of canids are similar , typically having long muzzles , upright ears , teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh , long legs , and bushy tails . They are mostly social animals , living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively . Typically , only the dominant pair in a group breeds , and a litter of young are reared annually in an underground den . Canids communicate by scent signals and vocalizations . One canid , the domestic dog , long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals .",
  "/wiki/Wolf": "The wolf ( Canis lupus ) , also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf , is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America . It is the largest extant member of Canidae , with males averaging 40 kg ( 88 lb ) and females 37 kg ( 82 lb ) . On average , wolves measure 105-160 cm ( 41-63 in ) in length and 80-85 cm ( 31-33 in ) at shoulder height . The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed features , particularly the ears and muzzle . The wolf is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species , such as the coyote and the golden jackal , to produce fertile hybrids with them . The winter fur of a wolf is long and bushy and predominantly mottled gray , although nearly pure white , red and brown to black colours also occur . Up to 38 subspecies of wolf have been recognized including the domestic dog . The wolf is the most specialized member of the genus Canis for cooperative big game hunting , as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey , its more social nature , and its highly advanced expressive behaviour . It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring . Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition within the pack for food . Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality . The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds primarily on large wild hooved mammals , though it also eats smaller animals , livestock , carrion , and garbage .",
  "/wiki/Local_extinction": "Local extinction or extirpation is the condition of a species ( or other taxon ) that ceases to exist in the chosen geographic area of study , though it still exists elsewhere . Local extinctions are contrasted with global extinctions . Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations ; wolf reintroduction is an example of this .",
  "/wiki/Great_Lakes_region": "The Great Lakes region of North America is a bi-national Canadian-American region that includes portions of the eight U.S. states of Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , Minnesota , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as well as the Canadian province of Ontario . Quebec is at times included as part of the region because , although it is not in a Great Lake watershed , it is in the St. Lawrence watershed which is part of a continuous hydrologic system that includes the Great Lakes and eventually discharges into the Atlantic Ocean . The region centers on the Great Lakes and forms a distinctive historical , economic , and cultural identity . A portion of the region also encompasses the Great Lakes Megalopolis . Participating state and provincial governments are represented in the Conference of Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers , which also serves as the Secretariat to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Compact and the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Agreement . The Great Lakes region takes its name from the corresponding geological formation of the Great Lakes Basin , a narrow watershed encompassing The Great Lakes , bounded by watersheds to the region 's north ( Hudson Bay ) , west ( Mississippi ) , east and south ( Ohio ) . To the east , the rivers of St. Lawrence , Richelieu , Hudson , Mohawk and Susquehanna form an arc of watersheds east to The Atlantic . The Great Lakes region , as distinct from the Great Lakes Basin , defines a unit of sub-national political entities defined by the U.S. states and the Canadian Province of Ontario encompassing the Great Lakes watershed , and the states and Province bordering one or more of the Great Lakes .",
  "/wiki/Northwestern_United_States": "The Northwestern United States , also known as the American Northwest , is an informal geographic region of the United States . The region consistently includes the states of Oregon , Washington , Idaho , Montana and Wyoming . Some sources include Southeast Alaska in the Northwest . The related but distinct term Pacific Northwest generally excludes areas from the Rockies eastward . The Northwestern United States is a subportion of the Western United States ( which is , itself , even more ambiguous ) . In contrast , states included in the neighboring regions ( Southwestern United States and Great Plains ) and Utah are not simultaneously considered part of both regions . Like the southwestern United States , the Northwest definition has moved westward over time . The current area includes the old Oregon Territory ( created in 1848-Oregon , Washington , Idaho , and areas in Montana west of the Continental Divide ) . The region is similar to Federal Region X , which comprises Oregon , Washington , Idaho , and Alaska . It is home to over 14.2 million people . Some of the fastest growing cities in this region and in the nation include Seattle , Spokane , Bellevue , Tacoma , Vancouver , Kennewick , Pasco , Yakima , Portland , Eugene , Salem , Boise , Idaho Falls , Missoula , Bozeman , and Billings .",
  "/wiki/Red_wolf": "The red wolf ( Canis lupus rufus or Canis rufus ) is a canine native to the southeastern United States which has a reddish-tawny color to its fur . Morphologically it is intermediate between the coyote and gray wolf , and is very closely related to the eastern wolf of eastern Canada . The red wolf 's proper taxonomic classification - in essence , whether it is an admixture of wolf and coyote or a third , distinct species - has been contentious for well over a century and is still under debate . Because of this , it is sometimes excluded from endangered species lists despite its critically low numbers . Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 , the U.S . Fisheries and Wildlife service currently recognizes the red wolf as an endangered and grants protected status . Canis rufus is not listed in the CITES Appendices of endangered species . Since 1996 the IUCN has listed it as a critically endangered species .",
  "/wiki/American_red_fox": "The American red fox ( Vulpes vulpes fulvus ) , commonly known as the eastern American red fox , is a North American subspecies of the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) . Historically , red foxes were classified as two species : Vulpes vulpes in Eurasia and Vulpes fulva in the Americas ( Tesky , 1995 ) . Since 1959 they have been considered to be a singular species of Vulpes vulpes , with Vulpes fulva one of the ten subspecies ( Hall , 1981 ; Kamler & Ballard , 2002 ) . The American red fox differs from European forms by the greater breadth of its feet , its longer fur , noticeably shorter nose and ears , and its finer brush . According to hunters ' accounts , they have less vigor and endurance in the chase compared to the European variant . Some authorities give it full species recognition as Vulpes fulva . It is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely distributed members of the order Carnivora , occurring in North America . It is listed as least concern by the IUCN .",
  "/wiki/Gray_fox": "The gray fox ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) , or grey fox , is an omnivorous mammal of the family Canidae , widespread throughout North America and Central America . This species and its only congener , the diminutive island fox ( Urocyon littoralis ) of the California Channel Islands , are the only living members of the genus Urocyon , which is considered to be the most basal of the living canids . Though it was once the most common fox in the eastern United States , and still is found there , human advancement and deforestation allowed the red fox to become more dominant . The Pacific States still have the gray fox as a dominant . It is the only American canid that can climb trees . Its specific epithet cinereoargenteus means ashen silver .",
  "/wiki/American_black_bear": "The American black bear ( Ursus americanus , previously known as Euarctos americanus ) is a medium-sized bear native to North America . It is the continent 's smallest and most widely distributed bear species . American black bears are omnivores , with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location . They typically live in largely forested areas , but do leave forests in search of food . Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food . The American black bear is the world 's most common bear species . It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as a least-concern species , due to its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined . Along with the brown bear , it is one of only two of the eight modern bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction . American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears , a behavior common to many species of bears .",
  "/wiki/Ursidae": "Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae . They are classified as caniforms , or doglike carnivorans . Although only eight species of bears are extant , they are widespread , appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere . Bears are found on the continents of North America , South America , Europe , and Asia . Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs , long snouts , small rounded ears , shaggy hair , plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws , and short tails . While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous , and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo , the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets . With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young , bears are typically solitary animals . They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell . Despite their heavy build and awkward gait , they are adept runners , climbers , and swimmers . Bears use shelters , such as caves and logs , as their dens ; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation , up to 100 days . Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur ; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment , such as being made to dance . With their powerful physical presence , they play a prominent role in the arts , mythology , and other cultural aspects of various human societies .",

  "/wiki/Raccoon": "The raccoon ( /r\u0259\u02c8ku\u02d0n/ or US : /r\u00e6\u02c8ku\u02d0n/ ( listen ) , Procyon lotor ) , sometimes spelled racoon , also known as the common raccoon , North American raccoon , northern raccoon , or coon , is a medium-sized mammal native to North America . The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family , having a body length of 40 to 70 cm ( 16 to 28 in ) and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg ( 11 to 57 lb ) . Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather . Three of the raccoon 's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws , its facial mask , and its ringed tail , which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas . Raccoons are noted for their intelligence , with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years . They are usually nocturnal and omnivorous , eating about 40% invertebrates , 33% plants , and 27% vertebrates . The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests , but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas , coastal marshes , and urban areas , where some homeowners consider them to be pests . As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century , raccoons are now also distributed across much of mainland Europe , Caucasus , and Japan . Though previously thought to be generally solitary , there is now evidence that raccoons engage in sex-specific social behavior . Related females often share a common area , while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season , and other potential invaders . Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares ( 7.4 acres ) for females in cities to 5,000 hectares ( 12,000 acres ) for males in prairies . After a gestation period of about 65 days , two to five young , known as kits , are born in spring .",

  "/wiki/North_American_river_otter": "The North American river otter ( Lontra canadensis ) , also known as the northern river otter or the common otter , is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to the North American continent found in and along its waterways and coasts . An adult North American river otter can weigh between 5.0 and 14 kg ( 11.0 and 30.9 lb ) . The river otter is protected and insulated by a thick , water-repellent coat of fur . The North American river otter , a member of the subfamily Lutrinae in the weasel family ( Mustelidae ) , is equally versatile in the water and on land . It establishes a burrow close to the water 's edge in river , lake , swamp , coastal shoreline , tidal flat , or estuary ecosystems . The den typically has many tunnel openings , one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water . Female North American river otters give birth in these burrows , producing litters of one to six young . North American river otters , like most predators , prey upon the most readily accessible species . Fish is a favored food among the otters , but they also consume various amphibians ( such as salamanders and frogs ) , freshwater clams , mussels , snails , small turtles and crayfish . The most common fish consumed are perch , suckers , and catfish . Instances of North American river otters eating small mammals , such as mice and squirrels , and occasionally birds have been reported as well . There have also been some reports of river otters attacking and even drowning dogs .",

The two stink badgers in the genus Mydaus inhabit Indonesia and the Philippines ; the other members of the family inhabit the Americas , ranging from Canada to central South America . All other mephitids are extinct , known through fossils , including those from Eurasia . Skunks were formerly classified as a subfamily of the Mustelidae ( the weasel family ) ; however , recent genetic evidence has caused skunks to be treated as a separate family . Similarly , the stink badgers had been classified with badgers , but genetic evidence shows they share a more recent common ancestor with skunks , so they are now included in the skunk family .

  "/wiki/Eastern_spotted_skunk": "The eastern spotted skunk ( Spilogale putorius ) is a small , relatively slender skunk found in North America , throughout the eastern United States and in small areas of Canada and Mexico . This small skunk is more weasel-like in body shape than the more familiar striped skunk . The eastern spotted skunk has four stripes on its back which are broken in pattern , giving it a spotted appearance . They have a white spot on their forehead . They are found in Canada ( southeast Manitoba and northwestern Ontario ) , the United States and northeastern Mexico . Males , at 46.3-68.8 cm ( 18.2-27.1 in ) in total length , are large than females , at 35-54.4 cm ( 13.8-21.4 in ) . The tail accounts for roughly a third of their total length .

  "/wiki/Felidae": "Felidae is a family of mammals in the order Carnivora , colloquially referred to as cats , and constitutes a clade . A member of this family is also called a felid . The term cat refers both to felids in general and specifically to the domestic cat ( Felis catus ) . Felidae species exhibit the most diverse fur pattern of all terrestrial carnivores . Cats have retractile claws , slender muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs . Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite . They are all obligate carnivores , and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey . Wild cats occur in Africa , Europe , Asia and the Americas . Some wild cat species are adapted to forest habitats , some to arid environments , and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain . Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal , depending on their preferred prey species . Reginald Innes Pocock divided the extant Felidae into three subfamilies : the Pantherinae , the Felinae and the Acinonychinae , differing from each other by the ossification of the hyoid apparatus and by the cutaneous sheaths which protect their claws . This concept has been revised following developments in molecular biology and techniques for analysis of morphological data .",

  "/wiki/Bobcat": "The bobcat ( Lynx rufus ) is a medium-sized North American cat that first appeared during the Irvingtonian stage around 1.8 million years ago ( AEO ) . Containing two recognized subspecies , it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico , including most of the contiguous United States . The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas , as well as semidesert , urban edge , forest edge , and swampland environments . It remains in some of its original range , but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ( extirpation ) by coyotes and domestic animals . With a gray to brown coat , whiskered face , and black-tufted ears , the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized genus Lynx . It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx , with which it shares parts of its range , but is about twice as large as the domestic cat . It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped , stubby ( or bobbed ) tail , from which it derives its name . Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares , it hunts insects , chickens , geese and other birds , small rodents , and deer . Prey selection depends on location and habitat , season , and abundance . Like most cats , the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary , although with some overlap in home ranges . It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries , including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces . The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months ."
