The Brooklyn Branch , known as the Wall and William Streets Branch during construction , from the main line at Chambers Street southeast through the Clark Street Tunnel to Borough Hall in Downtown Brooklyn , is also part of the Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line . The line was constructed in two main portions by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) , a private operator . The first portion , north of 42nd Street , was opened between 1904 and 1908 , and is part of the first subway line in the city . The line ran from City Hall , up the Lexington Avenue Line , across 42nd Street , and up Seventh Avenue and Broadway , before splitting into the Broadway Branch and the Lenox Avenue Line . The second portion of the line , that south of 42nd Street , was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts , which were signed between the IRT , the New York Municipal Railway ( a subsidiary of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ) , and the City of New York . Among the various subway lines that were to be constructed as part of the contracts , the West Side Line was to be extended south along Seventh Avenue to serve Manhattan 's West Side . This extension extended service to the end of Lower Manhattan and into Brooklyn , relieving crowding on the East Side Line , while opening up service to new areas . The Pennsylvania Railroad 's new hub in Manhattan , Penn Station , could now be accessed by the subway . Additionally , Manhattan 's West Side was rebuilt with the arrival of the line . To allow the wide four-track line to go through the area , new streets had to be mapped and built , and new buildings were constructed as a result .",
