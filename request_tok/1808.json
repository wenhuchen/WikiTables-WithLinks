It was the de facto language of the Soviet Union until its dissolution on 25 December 1991 . Although nearly three decades have passed since the breakup of the Soviet Union , Russian is used in official capacity or in public life in all the post-Soviet nation-states , as well as in Israel and Mongolia . Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages , one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages , and part of the larger Balto-Slavic branch . Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onward . Russian is the largest native language in Europe and the most geographically widespread language in Eurasia . It is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages , with 144 million speakers in Russia , Ukraine and Belarus . Russian is the eighth most spoken language in the world by number of native speakers and the seventh by total number of speakers . The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations . Russian is also the second most widespread language on the Internet , after English . Russian distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without , the so-called soft and hard sounds .",

The First Chechen War ( December 1994 - August 1996 ) resulted in the victory of the separatist forces . After achieving de facto independence from Russia in 1996 , the Chechen government failed to establish order . In 1997 the Chechen Republic adopted sharia and carried out public executions . In November 1997 Chechnya was proclaimed an Islamic republic . A Second Chechen War began in August 1999 and ended in May 2000 , with Chechen rebels continuing attacks as an insurgency .",
  "/wiki/Counterterrorism": "Counter-terrorism ( also spelled counterterrorism ) , also known as antiterrorism , incorporates the practice , military tactics , techniques , and strategy that government , military , law enforcement , business , and intelligence agencies use to combat or prevent terrorism . Counter-terrorism strategy is a government 's plan to use the instruments of national power to neutralize terrorists , their organizations , and their networks in order to render them incapable of using violence to instill fear and to coerce the government or its citizens to react in accordance with the terrorists goals . If terrorism is part of a broader insurgency , counter-terrorism may employ counter-insurgency measures . The United States Armed Forces use the term foreign internal defense for programs that support other countries in attempts to suppress insurgency , lawlessness , or subversion or to reduce the conditions under which these threats to security may develop . [ citation needed ] At a workshop of experts at RAND in October 2019 which included David Kilcullen , Ben Connable and Christine Wormuth , the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy officially rolled out the Irregular Warfare Annex and said it was a critical component of the U.S. 2018 National Defense Strategy . He explained that irregular warfare ( IW ) included counter-insurgency ( COIN ) , counter-terrorism ( CT ) , unconventional warfare ( UW ) , foreign internal defense ( FID ) , sabotage and subversion , as well as stabilization ( warfare ) and information operations ( IO ) , among other areas . He continued , that IW was perceived as primarily the CT effort used to fight violent extremist organizations as that has been the focus since 2001 , but it should be applied to all areas of military competition . These areas include the global powers competitors of China and Russia as well as the rogue states of North Korea and Iran . Mulroy emphasized that the U.S. must be prepared to respond with aggressive , dynamic , and unorthodox approaches to IW to be competitive across these priorities .",

  "/wiki/Spaceflight": "Spaceflight ( or space flight ) is ballistic flight into or through outer space . Spaceflight can occur with spacecraft with or without humans on board . Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union was the first human to conduct a spaceflight . Examples of human spaceflight include the U.S. Apollo Moon landing and Space Shuttle programs and the Russian Soyuz program , as well as the ongoing International Space Station . Examples of uncrewed spaceflight include space probes that leave Earth orbit , as well as satellites in orbit around Earth , such as communications satellites . These operate either by telerobotic control or are fully autonomous . Spaceflight is used in space exploration , and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications . Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories , reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites . A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth . Once in space , the motion of a spacecraft - both when unpropelled and when under propulsion - is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics . Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely , some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry , and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact .",
  "/wiki/Space_station": "A space station , also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station , is a spacecraft capable of supporting a human crew in orbit for an extended period of time that lacks major propulsion or landing systems . Stations must have docking ports to allow other spacecraft to dock to transfer crew and supplies . The purpose of maintaining an orbital outpost varies depending on the program . Space stations have most often been launched for scientific purposes , but military launches have also occurred . As of 2019 [ update ] , one fully operational and permanently inhabited space station is in low Earth orbit : the International Space Station ( ISS ) , which is used to study the effects of long-term space flight on the human body as well as to provide a location to conduct a greater number and length of scientific studies than is possible on other space vehicles . China , India , Russia , and the U.S. , as well as Bigelow Aerospace and Axiom Space , are all planning other stations for the coming decades .",
  "/wiki/Mir": "Mir ( Russian : \u041c\u0438\u0440 , IPA : [ \u02c8m\u02b2ir ] ; lit . peace or world ) was a space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001 , operated by the Soviet Union and later by Russia . Mir was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996 . It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft . At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit , succeeded by the International Space Station ( ISS ) after Mir 's orbit decayed . The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology , human biology , physics , astronomy , meteorology , and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space . Mir was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and held the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days , until it was surpassed by the ISS on 23 October 2010 . It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight , with Valeri Polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995 . Mir was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan , having the capacity to support a resident crew of three , or larger crews for short visits . Following the success of the Salyut programme , Mir represented the next stage in the Soviet Union 's space station programme . The first module of the station , known as the core module or base block , was launched in 1986 and followed by six further modules . Proton rockets were used to launch all of its components except for the docking module , which was installed by US Space Shuttle mission STS-74 in 1995 ."
