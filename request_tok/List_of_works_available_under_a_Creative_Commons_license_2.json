The second book , Love is a Battlefield was illustrated by Xin Ye . Before his departure , David Hahn was the artist for much of the third book , Hamsterdance versus the Charlie Foxtrot , which will be completed by Xin Ye with colors and inks by Lauri Ahonen and Lillian Chen . A portion of the webcomic series has been animated , Ken-Burns-style , with voice-over work by Arthur Chu . Erfworld follows a graphic novel format , with a new page added with each update . The setting is Erfworld , a fantasy world that adheres to the rules of a fictional turn-based strategy wargame . The narrative focuses on a complex story about warring factions within this world , but most installments also contain humor , puns , and side-gags about strategy-fantasy video games , role-playing games , and references to history or popular culture . The webcomic 's distinctive visual style counters the theme of unending violence with a twee , kawaii artistic sensibility ( described by the creators as cute ) in which characters are drawn to look like dolls , or anime characters , or toys . Injuries draw no blood in Erfworld , and damage is cured overnight .",
