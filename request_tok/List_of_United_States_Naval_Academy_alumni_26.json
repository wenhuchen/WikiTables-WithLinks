  "/wiki/F-105": "The Republic F-105 Thunderchief was an American supersonic fighter-bomber used by the United States Air Force . Capable of Mach 2 , it conducted the majority of strike bombing missions during the early years of the Vietnam War ; it was the only American aircraft to have been removed from combat due to high loss rates . Originally designed as a single-seat , nuclear-attack aircraft , a two-seat Wild Weasel version was later developed for the specialized Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses ( SEAD ) role against surface-to-air missile sites . The F-105 was commonly known as the Thud by its crews . As a follow-on to the Mach 1 capable North American F-100 Super Sabre , the F-105 was also armed with missiles and a rotary cannon ; however , its design was tailored to high-speed low-altitude penetration carrying a single nuclear weapon internally . First flown in 1955 , the Thunderchief entered service in 1958 . The single-engine F-105 could deliver a greater bomb load than some American heavy bombers of World War II such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator . The F-105 was one of the primary attack aircraft of the Vietnam War ; over 20,000 Thunderchief sorties were flown , with 382 aircraft lost including 62 operational ( non-combat ) losses ( out of the 833 produced ) . Although less agile than smaller MiG fighters , USAF F-105s were credited with 27.5 kills . During the war , the single-seat F-105D was the primary aircraft delivering the heavy bomb loads against the various military targets . Meanwhile , the two-seat F-105F and F-105G Wild Weasel variants became the first dedicated SEAD platforms , fighting against the Soviet-built S-75 Dvina ( NATO reporting name : SA-2 Guideline ) surface-to-air missiles . Two Wild Weasel pilots were awarded the Medal of Honor for attacking North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile sites , with one shooting down two MiG-17s the same day .",

During the August Revolution following World War II , Vietnamese communist revolutionary H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh , leader of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh , declared independence from French Indochina on 2 September 1945 , announcing the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam . The Vi\u1ec7t Minh ( League for the Independence of Vietnam ) was a coalition of multiple Vietnamese nationalist groups , mostly led by communists who increasingly marginalized non-communists in the organisation after the reestablishment of the previously banned Communist Party of Vietnam in February 1951 . France moved in to reassert its colonial dominance over Vietnam which led to the First Indochina War in December 1946 , a bloody guerrilla war between France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh . The Vi\u1ec7t Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas in Vietnam which led to French defeat in 1954 . The negotiations in the Geneva Conference that year ended the war and recognized Vietnamese independence . The Geneva Accords provisionally divided the country into a northern and a southern zone along the 17th parallel , stipulating general elections in July 1956 to bring about the unification of Viet-Nam . The northern zone was controlled by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and became commonly called North Vietnam , while the southern zone , under control of the French-established State of Vietnam was commonly called South Vietnam . Supervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India , Canada , and Poland . The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords and stated that it shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly . In July 1955 , the prime minister of the State of Vietnam , Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m , announced that South Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country .

The A-6 was developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s in response to a requirement issued by the United States Navy for an all-weather jet-powered carrier-based attack aircraft . It was designed as a successor for multiple existing medium-sized attack aircraft , such as the piston-engined Douglas A-1 Skyraider . Unlike its predecessors , and even some contemporaries , the A-6 made extensive use of interconnected avionics . Operated by a crew of two in a side-by-side seating configuration , the workload were divided between the pilot and weapons officer . In addition to conventional munitions , the type was also compatible with the Navy 's air-based nuclear weapons , which were deployable via a toss bombing techniques . On 19 April 1960 , the prototype performed the type 's maiden flight . The A-6 was in service with the United States Navy and Marine Corps between 1963 and 1997 , multiple variants of the type being introduced during this time . From the A-6 , a specialized electronic warfare derivative , the EA-6B Prowler , was developed . It was deployed during various overseas conflicts , including the Vietnam War and the Gulf War .

The prison was built in Hanoi by the French , in dates ranging from 1886-1889 to 1898 to 1901 , when Vietnam was still part of French Indochina . The French called the prison Maison Centrale , 'Central House ' , which is still the designation of prisons for dangerous or long sentence detainees in France . It was located near Hanoi 's French Quarter . It was intended to hold Vietnamese prisoners , particularly political prisoners agitating for independence who were often subject to torture and execution . A 1913 renovation expanded its capacity from 460 inmates to 600 . It was nevertheless often overcrowded , holding some 730 prisoners on a given day in 1916 , a figure which rose to 895 in 1922 and 1,430 in 1933 . By 1954 it held more than 2000 people ; with its inmates held in subhuman conditions , it had become a symbol of colonialist exploitation and of the bitterness of the Vietnamese towards the French . The central urban location of the prison also became part of its early character . During the 1910s through 1930s , street peddlers made an occupation of passing outside messages in through the jail 's windows and tossing tobacco and opium over the walls ; letters and packets would be thrown out to the street in the opposite direction .

It received international recognition in 1949 as the State of Vietnam ( a self-governing entity in the French Empire ) , which was a constitutional monarchy ( 1949-1955 ) . The country was renamed the Republic of Vietnam in 1955 . Its capital was Saigon ( now Ho Chi Minh City ) . South Vietnam was bordered by North Vietnam to the north , Laos to the northwest , Cambodia to the southwest , Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest , and the Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei , and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast .

It had membership in several special committees of the United Nations , but its application for full membership was rejected in 1957 because of a Soviet veto ( neither South nor North Vietnam were members of the UN during the Vietnam War , but the united Vietnam became a member state in 1977 ) . South Vietnam 's origins can be traced to the French colony of Cochinchina , which consisted of the southern third of Vietnam which was Cochinchina [ Nam K\u1ef3 ] , a subdivision of French Indochina , and the southern half of Central Vietnam or Annam [ Trung K\u1ef3 ] which was a French protectorate .

The Legion of Merit is seventh in the order of precedence of all U.S. military awards and is worn after the Defense Superior Service Medal and before the Distinguished Flying Cross . In contemporary use in the U.S. Armed Forces , the Legion of Merit is typically awarded to Army , Marine Corps , and Air Force general officers and colonels , and Navy and Coast Guard flag officers and captains occupying senior command or very senior staff positions in their respective services . It may also be awarded to officers of lesser rank , senior warrant officers ( typically in command positions at the rank of CW5 ) , and to very senior enlisted personnel ( typically in the rank of CSM and SMA in the Army , FLTCM and MCPON in the Navy , CMSAF in the Air Force and SgtMajMC in the Marine Corps ) , but these instances are less frequent , typically by exception , and the circumstances vary by branch of service . Authority to award the Legion of Merit is reserved for general officers and flag officers in pay grade O-9 ( e.g . lieutenant general and vice admiral ) and above , civilian Department of Defense personnel at assistant service secretary or Assistant Secretary of Defense level and above , or equivalent secretary-level civilian personnel with the Department of Homeland Security with direct oversight of the U.S. Coast Guard .",
