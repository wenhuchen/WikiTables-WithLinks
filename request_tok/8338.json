Their classic collection , Children 's and Household Tales ( Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen ) , was published in two volumes - the first in 1812 and the second in 1815 . The brothers were born in the town of Hanau in Hesse-Cassel ( now Germany ) and spent most of their childhood in the nearby town of Steinau . Their father 's death in 1796 impoverished the family and affected the brothers for many years after . They attended the University of Marburg where they began a lifelong dedication to researching the early history of German language and literature , including German folktales . The rise of Romanticism during the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories , which to the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national literature and culture . The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies . Between the first edition of 1812-1815 and the seventh ( and final ) edition of 1857 , they revised their collection many times , so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200 . In addition to collecting and editing folk tales , the brothers compiled German legends . Individually , they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship . Together , in 1838 , they began work on a massive historical German dictionary ( Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch ) which , in their lifetimes , they completed only as far as the word Frucht ( 'fruit ' ) .",

The story centres on orphan Oliver Twist , born in a workhouse and sold into apprenticeship with an undertaker . After escaping , Oliver travels to London , where he meets the Artful Dodger , a member of a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin . Oliver Twist is notable for its unromantic portrayal of criminals and their sordid lives , as well as for exposing the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London in the mid-19th century . The alternative title , The Parish Boy 's Progress , alludes to Bunyan 's The Pilgrim 's Progress , as well as the 18th-century caricature series by William Hogarth , A Rake 's Progress and A Harlot 's Progress . In this early example of the social novel , Dickens satirises the hypocrisies of his time , including child labour , the recruitment of children as criminals , and the presence of street children . The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe , an orphan whose account of working as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s . It is likely that Dickens 's own experiences as a youth contributed as well . Oliver Twist has been the subject of numerous adaptations for various media , including a highly successful musical play , Oliver ! , and the multiple Academy Award-winning 1968 motion picture .

His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the 20th century , critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories are still widely read today . Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed readings extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms . Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense . The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features .",

After their visits , Scrooge is transformed into a kinder , gentler man . Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions , including carols , and newer customs such as Christmas trees . He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors , including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold . Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella , and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School , one of several establishments for London 's street children . The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story . There is discussion among academics as to whether this is a fully secular story , or if it is a Christian allegory . Published on 19 December , the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve ; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released . Most critics reviewed the novella favourably .",
