  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet , moon , or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere , formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body . In contrast to volcanic craters , which result from explosion or internal collapse , impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain . Impact craters range from small , simple , bowl-shaped depressions to large , complex , multi-ringed impact basins . Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth . Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon , Mercury , Callisto , Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids . On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes , such as Earth , Venus , Mars , Europa , Io and Titan , visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded , buried or transformed by tectonics over time . Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography , the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used . In early literature , before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised , the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth . The cratering records of very old surfaces , such as Mercury , the Moon , and the southern highlands of Mars , record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago . The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower , but it is appreciable nonetheless ; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter ( 12 mi ) crater about once every million years on average . This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far . The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system .",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",
  "/wiki/Eponym": "An eponym is a person , place , or thing after whom or after which something is named , or believed to be named , or the thing so named . The adjectives derived from eponym include eponymous and eponymic . For example , Elizabeth I of England is the eponym of the Elizabethan era , and the eponymous founder of the Ford Motor Company refers to Henry Ford , and Ford and Elizabethan England are both eponyms .",
  "/wiki/Abedin_(crater)": "Abedin is a crater on Mercury . It is named after the Bangladeshi painter Zainul Abedin . It exhibits a complex crater structure with a smooth floor , wall terraces , and a central peak complex . The chains of smaller craters surrounding Abedin are secondary craters formed by ejecta from the initial impact . The northwestern section of Abedin 's continuous ejecta blanket appears to have a lower reflectance than the rest of the material adjacent to the crater rim . This pattern suggests that the darker material resided at some depth beneath the northwestern portion of the pre-impact target area and was excavated and redeposited during the crater 's formation .",
  "/wiki/Zainul_Abedin": "Zainul Abedin ( 29 December 1914 - 28 May 1976 ) was a Bangladeshi painter . He became well known in 1944 through his series of paintings depicting some of the great famines in Bengal during its British colonial period . After the Partition of Indian subcontinent he moved to East Pakistan ( now Bangladesh ) . In 1948 , he helped to establish the Institute of Arts and Crafts ( now Faculty of Fine Arts ) at University of Dhaka . The Indian Express has described him as a legendary Bangladeshi painter . Like many of his contemporaries , his paintings on the Bengal famine of 1943 are viewed as his most characteristic works . His homeland honored him with given the title Shilpacharjo ( Bengali : \u09b6\u09bf\u09b2\u09cd\u09aa\u09be\u099a\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09af ) Great teacher of the arts for his artistic and visionary attributes .

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic .

Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet .

From the 4th century BC onwards , urbanisation and mercantile activity along the western and eastern coasts of what is today Kerala and Tamil Nadu led to the development of four large Tamil political states , the Cheras , Cholas , Pandyas and Pallavas and a number of smaller states , all of whom were warring amongst themselves for dominance . The Jaffna Kingdom , inhabited by Sri Lankan Tamils , was once one of the strongest kingdoms of Sri Lanka , and controlled much of the north of the island . Tamils were noted for their influence on regional trade throughout the Indian Ocean . Artifacts marking the presence of Roman traders show direct trade was active between Rome and southern India , and the Pandyas were recorded as having sent at least two embassies directly to Emperor Augustus in Rome . The Pandyas and Cholas were historically active in Sri Lanka . The Chola dynasty successfully invaded several areas in southeast Asia , including the powerful Srivijaya and the Malay city-state of Kedah . Medieval Tamil guilds and trading organizations like the Ayyavole and Manigramam played an important role in Southeast Asian trading networks .",

  "/wiki/Sofonisba_Anguissola": "Sofonisba Anguissola ( c. 1532 - 16 November 1625 ) , also known as Sophonisba Angussola or Sophonisba Anguisciola , was an Italian Renaissance painter born in Cremona to a relatively poor noble family . She received a well-rounded education that included the fine arts , and her apprenticeship with local painters set a precedent for women to be accepted as students of art . As a young woman , Anguissola traveled to Rome where she was introduced to Michelangelo , who immediately recognized her talent , and to Milan , where she painted the Duke of Alba . The Spanish queen , Elizabeth of Valois , was a keen amateur painter and in 1559 Anguissola was recruited to go to Madrid as her tutor , with the rank of lady-in-waiting . She later became an official court painter to the king , Philip II , and adapted her style to the more formal requirements of official portraits for the Spanish court . After the queen 's death , Philip helped arrange an aristocratic marriage for her . She moved to Sicily , and later Pisa and Genoa , where she continued to practice as a leading portrait painter . Her most distinctive and attractive paintings are her portraits of herself and her family , which she painted before she moved to the Spanish court . In particular , her depictions of children were fresh and closely observed . At the Spanish court she painted formal state portraits in the prevailing official style , as one of the first , and most successful , of the relatively few female court painters . Later in her life she also painted religious subjects , although many of her religious paintings have been lost . In 1625 , she died at age 93 in Palermo .",

She is one of the nine outstanding ancient women poets listed by Antipater of Thessalonica in the Palatine Anthology . He called her the female Homer because her poetry was so admired . She was among the first Hellenistic poets to write bucolic poetry that praised life in the country . She was called Anyte the lyric poet in antiquity , although none of her lyric poetry has survived . Likewise , Pausanias refers to her epic poetry , but none of it has survived . Anyte was from Tegea in Arcadia . No reliable information about her life survives , and she can only be approximately dated by the style of her work . Only one story about Anyte 's life is preserved , in which Pausanias claims that Anyte was once visited by the god Asclepius while she was asleep , and told to go to Naupactus to visit a certain blind man there . On doing so , the man was cured , and he built a temple to Asclepius . Though little is known about Anyte 's life , more of her poetry survives than any other ancient Greek woman , with the exception of Sappho .",
  "/wiki/Apollodorus_(crater)": "Apollodorus is an impact crater on Mercury . Its unusual appearance , with radiating dark troughs , led to a nickname of the Spider by scientists before its official name was decided . Apollodorus is located near the center of Pantheon Fossae , which is a system of radial grabens situated in the inner part of the Caloris basin . The floor , rim and walls of Apollodorus expose a low reflectance material ( LRM ) excavated during the impact from beneath the light volcanic plains , which cover the central part of the Caloris . It is not currently known whether it played a role in the fossae 's formation or if its location is merely a coincidence , although no graben appears to cut the crater rim , and the dark impact ejecta partially covers grabens , suggesting that Apollodorus postdates Pantheon Fossae . In addition , the crater is slightly ( by about 40 km ) offset from the exact center of the Pantheon Fossae . Apollodorus of Damascus is credited as the architect of the Pantheon in Rome .",

  "/wiki/Ancient_Greek": "Ancient Greek includes the forms of the Greek language used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD . It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period ( 9th to 6th centuries BC ) , Classical period ( 5th and 4th centuries BC ) , and Hellenistic period ( Koine Greek , 3rd century BC to 4th century AD ) . It is preceded by Mycenaean Greek and succeeded by Medieval Greek . Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage although its earliest form closely resembles Attic Greek and its latest form approaches Medieval Greek . There were several regional dialects of Ancient Greek , of which Attic Greek developed into Koine . Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of fifth-century Athenian historians , playwrights , and philosophers . It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the Western world since the Renaissance . This article primarily contains information about the Epic and Classical periods of the language ."
