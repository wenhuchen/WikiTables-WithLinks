He also served in the American Civil War as a general in the Confederate States Army , serving in the Army of Tennessee .",
  "/wiki/Confederate_States_Army": "The Confederate States Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America ( commonly referred to as the Confederacy ) during the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , fighting against the United States forces . On February 28 , 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate president , Jefferson Davis . Davis was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy , and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican-American War . He had also been a United States Senator from Mississippi and U.S. Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce . On March 1 , 1861 , on behalf of the Confederate government , Davis assumed control of the military situation at Charleston , South Carolina , where South Carolina state militia besieged Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor , held by a small U.S. Army garrison . By March 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army . An accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records ; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men . This does not include an unknown number of slaves who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army , such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons . Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war , they do not represent the size of the army at any given date . These numbers do not include men who served in Confederate States Navy . Although most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers , both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription , primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer . In the absence of exact records , estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts .",
  "/wiki/Brig._Gen._(CSA)": "The general officers of the Confederate States Army ( CSA ) were the senior military leaders of the Confederacy during the American Civil War of 1861-1865 . They were often former officers from the United States Army ( the regular army ) prior to the Civil War , while others were given the rank based on merit or when necessity demanded . Most Confederate generals needed confirmation from the Confederate Congress , much like prospective generals in the modern U.S. armed forces . Like all of the Confederacy 's military forces , these generals answered to their civilian leadership , in particular Jefferson Davis , the South 's president and therefore commander-in-chief of the Army , Navy , and Marines of the Confederate States .",
  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union .

  "/wiki/Department_of_the_Tennessee": "The Army of the Tennessee was a Union army in the Western Theater of the American Civil War , named for the Tennessee River . It appears that the term Army of the Tennessee was first used within the Union Army in March 1862 , to describe Union forces perhaps more properly described as the Army of West Tennessee ; these were the troops under the command of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in the Union 's District of West Tennessee . In April 1862 , Grant 's troops survived a severe test in the bloody Battle of Shiloh . Then , during six months marked by discouragement and anxiety for Grant , his army first joined with two other Union armies to prosecute the relatively bloodless Siege of Corinth and then strained to hold Union positions in Tennessee and Mississippi . In October 1862 , Grant 's command was reconfigured and elevated to departmental status , as the Department of the Tennessee ; the title of his command was thus officially aligned with that of his army . Grant commanded these forces until after his critically important victory at Vicksburg on July 4 , 1863 . Under other generals , starting with William Tecumseh Sherman , the army marched and fought from the Chattanooga Campaign , through the Relief of Knoxville , the Meridian Campaign , the Atlanta Campaign , the March to the Sea , the Carolinas Campaign , and to the end of the war and disbandment . This article also discusses Grant 's 1861-1862 commands - the District of Southeast Missouri and the District of Cairo - because the troops Grant led in the Battle of Belmont and the Henry-Donelson campaign during that period became the nucleus of the Army of the Tennessee . A 2005 study of the army states that it was present at most of the great battles that became turning points of the war - Fort Donelson , Vicksburg , and Atlanta and won the decisive battles in the decisive theater of the war . More poetically , in 1867 , apparently speaking of the Atlanta campaign , General Sherman said that the Army of the Tennessee was never checked - always victorious ; so rapid in motion - so eager to strike ; it deserved its name of the 'Whip-lash , ' swung from one flank to the other , as danger called , night or day , sunshine or storm .",

The U.S. Navy played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers . It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan . The U.S. Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world . The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence , deploying in strength in such areas as the Western Pacific , the Mediterranean , and the Indian Ocean . It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world , engage in forward deployments during peacetime and rapidly respond to regional crises , making it a frequent actor in U.S. foreign and military policy .",

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south .

A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians .

After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the port of Weihaiwei , the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895 . The war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty 's attempts to modernize its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty , especially when compared with Japan 's successful Meiji Restoration . For the first time , regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan ; the prestige of the Qing dynasty , along with the classical tradition in China , suffered a major blow .

  "/wiki/Texas_Revolution": "The Texas Revolution ( October 2 , 1835 - April 21 , 1836 ) was a rebellion of colonists from the United States and Tejanos ( Texas Mexicans ) in putting up armed resistance to the centralist government of Mexico . While the uprising was part of a larger one that included other provinces opposed to the regime of President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna , the Mexican government believed the United States had instigated the Texas insurrection with the goal of annexation . The Mexican Congress passed the Tornel Decree , declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such , being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag . Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico , establishing the Republic of Texas , and eventually being annexed by the United States . The revolution began in October 1835 , after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas . The Mexican government had become increasingly centralized and the rights of its citizens had become increasingly curtailed , particularly regarding immigration from the United States . Colonists and Tejanos disagreed on whether the ultimate goal was independence or a return to the Mexican Constitution of 1824 . While delegates at the Consultation ( provisional government ) debated the war 's motives , Texians and a flood of volunteers from the United States defeated the small garrisons of Mexican soldiers by mid-December 1835 . The Consultation declined to declare independence and installed an interim government , whose infighting led to political paralysis and a dearth of effective governance in Texas . An ill-conceived proposal to invade Matamoros siphoned much-needed volunteers and provisions from the fledgling Texian Army . In March 1836 , a second political convention declared independence and appointed leadership for the new Republic of Texas . Determined to avenge Mexico 's honor , Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas .",
