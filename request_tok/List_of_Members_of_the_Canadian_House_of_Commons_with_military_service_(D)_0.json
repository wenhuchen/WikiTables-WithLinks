Initially known as the Liberal-Conservative Party , it dropped Liberal from its name in 1873 , although many of its candidates continued to use this name . As a result of World War I and the Conscription Crisis of 1917 , the party joined with pro-conscription Liberals to become the Unionist Party , led by Robert Borden from 1917 to 1920 , and then the National Liberal and Conservative Party until 1922 . It then reverted to Liberal-Conservative Party until 1938 , when it became simply the National Conservative Party .

  "/wiki/United_States_Army": "The United States Army ( USA ) is the land warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces . It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers . As a branch of the armed forces , the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation 's wars , by providing prompt , sustained land dominance , across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict , in support of combatant commanders . The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States .",

The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada 's history , holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result , it is sometimes referred to as Canada 's natural governing party . The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice . In the 2015 federal election , the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election , winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats , gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons .

  "/wiki/Yale_(electoral_district)": "Yale was a federal electoral district in British Columbia , Canada , that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1872 to 1892 and from 1917 to 1953 . It first appeared when the original Yale District riding , which was created and filled by special byelection in 1871 at the time of BC 's entry into the Canadian Confederation , was abolished and replaced by Yale riding . Yale riding spanned both Yale and Kootenay Land Districts , that is to say , the entirety of the southern province from the Fraser Canyon to the Rockies . It was last used in the 1891 election , and was merged in 1892 with the Cariboo riding to form Yale - Cariboo . That arrangement lasted until 1914 when a further redistribution separated Yale and Cariboo once again . This second incarnation was considerably smaller than the first because Kootenay district was now in a different riding . In 1903 , the riding of Kootenay was split off from what had been the original Yale riding . The new Yale riding excluded the Town of Yale , and when it was reconstituted , coincided with the provincial Okanagan riding except for the city of Salmon Arm . The new incarnation of Yale lasted until the 1952 , when the Yale name vanished from the Commons and the Okanagan ridings , Okanagan Boundary and Okanagan - Revelstoke were created . The old core area around the town of historic and once-important Yale , which has long since became depopulated by being bypassed by massive growth elsewhere , was attached to the Fraser Valley riding , then to its successor Fraser Valley East , and then to today 's Chilliwack - Fraser Canyon . It was not in the second incarnation of the Yale riding when it was reconstituted in 1914 .",
