  "/wiki/Lockheed_EC-121_Warning_Star": "The Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star was an American Airborne early warning and control radar surveillance aircraft operational in the 1950s in both the United States Navy ( USN ) and United States Air Force ( USAF ) . The military version of the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation was used to serve as an airborne early warning system to supplement the Distant Early Warning Line , using 2 large radomes ( a vertical dome above and a horizontal one below the fuselage ) . It replaced the TBM-3W used by the USN . Some EC-121s were also used for Signal Intelligence gathering ( SIGINT ) . The EC-121 was introduced in 1954 and phased out in 1978 , although a single specially modified EW aircraft remained in USN service until 1982 . The USN versions when initially procured were designated WV-1 ( PO-1W ) , WV-2 , and WV-3 . The USAF Warning Stars served during the Vietnam War both as electronic sensor monitors and as a forerunner to the Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS . USAF aircrews adopted its civil nickname , Connie ( diminutive of Constellation ) as reference , USN aircrews used the nickname Willie Victor .",
  "/wiki/Lockheed_C-121_Constellation": "The Lockheed C-121 Constellation is a military transport version of the Lockheed Constellation . A total of 332 aircraft were constructed for both the United States Air Force and United States Navy for various purposes . Numerous airborne early warning versions were also constructed . The C-121 later saw service with smaller civilian operators until 1993 .",
  "/wiki/Consolidated_PB4Y-2_Privateer": "The Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer is a World War II and Korean War era patrol bomber of the United States Navy derived from the Consolidated B-24 Liberator . The Navy had been using B-24s with only minor modifications as the PB4Y-1 Liberator , and along with maritime patrol Liberators used by RAF Coastal Command this type of patrol plane was proven successful . A fully navalized design was desired , and Consolidated developed a dedicated long-range patrol bomber in 1943 , designated PB4Y-2 Privateer . In 1951 , the type was redesignated P4Y-2 Privateer . A further designation change occurred in September 1962 , when the remaining Navy Privateers ( all having previously been converted to drone configuration as P4Y-2K ) were redesignated QP-4B .",
  "/wiki/Lockheed_P-2_Neptune": "The Lockheed P-2 Neptune ( designated P2V by the United States Navy prior to September 1962 ) was a maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) aircraft . It was developed for the US Navy by Lockheed to replace the Lockheed PV-1 Ventura and PV-2 Harpoon , and was replaced in turn by the Lockheed P-3 Orion . Designed as a land-based aircraft , the Neptune never made a carrier landing , but a small number were converted and deployed as carrier-launched , stop-gap nuclear bombers that would have to land on shore or ditch . The type was successful in export , and saw service with several armed forces .",
  "/wiki/List_of_Lockheed_P-3_Orion_variants": "The Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft underwent a number of variants and specific unique design elements .

  "/wiki/Distant_Early_Warning_Line": "The Distant Early Warning Line , also known as the DEW Line or Early Warning Line , was a system of radar stations in the far northern Arctic region of Canada , with additional stations along the North Coast and Aleutian Islands of Alaska ( see Project Stretchout and Project Bluegrass ) , in addition to the Faroe Islands , Greenland , and Iceland . It was set up to detect incoming Soviet bombers during the Cold War , and provide early warning of any sea-and-land invasion . The DEW Line was the northernmost and most capable of three radar lines in Canada and Alaska . The first of these was the joint Canadian-US Pinetree Line , which ran from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island just north of the Canadian border , but even while it was being built there were concerns that it would not provide enough warning time to launch an effective counterattack . The Mid-Canada Line ( MCL ) was proposed as an inexpensive solution using a new type of radar . This provided a trip wire warning located roughly at the 55th parallel , giving commanders ample warning time , but little information on the targets or their exact location . The MCL proved largely useless in practice , as the radar return of flocks of birds overwhelmed signals from aircraft . The DEW Line was proposed as a solution to both of these problems , using conventional radar systems that could both detect and characterize an attack , while being located far to the north where they would offer hours of advanced warning . This would not only provide ample time for the defenses to prepare , but also allow the Strategic Air Command to get its active aircraft airborne long before Soviet bombers could reach their bases . The need was considered critical and the construction was given the highest national priorities . Advanced site preparation began in December 1954 , and the construction was carried out in a massive logistical operation that took place mostly during the summer months when the sites could be reached by ships . The 63-base Line reached operational status in 1957 ."
