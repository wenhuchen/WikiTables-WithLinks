  "/wiki/P\u00e8re_Goriot": "Le P\u00e8re Goriot ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ l\u0259 p\u025b\u0281 \u0261\u0254\u0281jo ] , Old Goriot or Father Goriot ) is an 1835 novel by French novelist and playwright Honor\u00e9 de Balzac ( 1799-1850 ) , included in the Sc\u00e8nes de la vie priv\u00e9e section of his novel sequence La Com\u00e9die humaine . Set in Paris in 1819 , it follows the intertwined lives of three characters : the elderly doting Goriot , a mysterious criminal-in-hiding named Vautrin and a naive law student named Eug\u00e8ne de Rastignac . Originally published in serial form during the winter of 1834-35 , Le P\u00e8re Goriot is widely considered Balzac 's most important novel . It marks the first serious use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books , a technique that distinguishes Balzac 's fiction . The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style , using minute details to create character and subtext . The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration , which brought profound changes to French society ; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book . The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters - especially young Rastignac , who grew up in the provinces of southern France . Balzac analyzes , through Goriot and others , the nature of family and marriage , providing a pessimistic view of these institutions . The novel was released to mixed reviews . Some critics praised the author for his complex characters and attention to detail ; others condemned him for his many depictions of corruption and greed . A favorite of Balzac 's , the book quickly won widespread popularity and has often been adapted for film and the stage . It gave rise to the French expression Rastignac , a social climber willing to use any means to better his situation .",
  "/wiki/Illusions_perdues": "Illusions perdues - in English , Lost Illusions - is a serial novel written by the French writer Honor\u00e9 de Balzac between 1837 and 1843 . It consists of three parts , starting in provincial France , thereafter moving to Paris , and finally returning to the provinces . Thus it resembles another of Balzac 's greatest novels , La Rabouilleuse ( The Black Sheep , 1842 ) , in that it is set partly in Paris and partly in the provinces . It is , however , unique among the novels and short stories of La Com\u00e9die humaine ( The Human Comedy , 1799-1850 ) by virtue of the even-handedness with which it treats both geographical dimensions of French social life .

The novel sequence La Com\u00e9die humaine , which presents a panorama of post-Napoleonic French life , is generally viewed as his magnum opus . Owing to his keen observation of detail and unfiltered representation of society , Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of realism in European literature . He is renowned for his multi-faceted characters ; even his lesser characters are complex , morally ambiguous and fully human . Inanimate objects are imbued with character as well ; the city of Paris , a backdrop for much of his writing , takes on many human qualities . His writing influenced many famous writers , including the novelists \u00c9mile Zola , Charles Dickens , Gustave Flaubert , and Henry James , filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as well as important philosophers such as Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx . Many of Balzac 's works have been made into films , and they continue to inspire other writers . An enthusiastic reader and independent thinker as a child , Balzac had trouble adapting to the teaching style of his grammar school . His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions to succeed in the world of business . When he finished school , Balzac was apprenticed in a law office , but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine . Before and during his career as a writer , he attempted to be a publisher , printer , businessman , critic , and politician ; he failed in all of these efforts . La Com\u00e9die Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties , and includes scenes from his own experience .",

The Com\u00e9die humaine consists of 91 finished works ( stories , novels or analytical essays ) and 46 unfinished works ( some of which exist only as titles ) . It does not include Balzac 's five theatrical plays or his collection of humorous tales , the Contes drolatiques ( 1832-37 ) . The title of the series is usually considered an allusion to Dante 's Divine Comedy ; while Ferdinand Bruneti\u00e8re , the famous French literary critic , suggests that it may stem from poems by Alfred de Musset or Alfred de Vigny . While Balzac sought the comprehensive scope of Dante , his title indicates the worldly , human concerns of a realist novelist . The stories are placed in a variety of settings , with characters reappearing in multiple stories .",
  "/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray": "The Picture of Dorian Gray is a Gothic and philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde , first published complete in the July 1890 issue of Lippincott 's Monthly Magazine . Fearing the story was indecent , the magazine 's editor deleted roughly five hundred words before publication without Wilde 's knowledge . Despite that censorship , The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers , some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding public morality . In response , Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press , although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year . The longer and revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray published in book form in 1891 featured an aphoristic preface - a defence of the artist 's rights and of art for art 's sake - based in part on his press defences of the novel the previous year . The content , style , and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right , as a literary and artistic manifesto . In April 1891 , the publishing firm of Ward , Lock and Company , who had distributed the shorter , more inflammatory , magazine version in England the previous year , published the revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray . The Picture of Dorian Gray is the only novel written by Wilde . It exists in several versions : the 1890 magazine edition ( in 13 chapters ) , with important material deleted before publication by the magazine 's editor , J. M. Stoddart ; the uncensored version submitted to Lippincott 's Monthly Magazine for publication ( also in 13 chapters ) , with all of Wilde 's original material intact , first published in 2011 by Harvard University Press ; and the 1891 book edition ( in 20 chapters ) . As literature of the 19th century , The Picture of Dorian Gray pivots on a gothic plot device with strong themes interpreted from Faust .",
  "/wiki/Oscar_Wilde": "Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde ( 16 October 1854 - 30 November 1900 ) was an Irish poet and playwright . After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s , the early 1890s saw him become one of the most popular playwrights in London . He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays , his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray , and the circumstances of his criminal conviction for gross indecency , imprisonment , and early death at age 46 . Wilde 's parents were successful Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin . A young Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German . At university , Wilde read Greats ; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional classicist , first at Trinity College Dublin , then at Oxford . He became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism , led by two of his tutors , Walter Pater and John Ruskin . After university , Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles . As a spokesman for aestheticism , he tried his hand at various literary activities : he published a book of poems , lectured in the United States and Canada on the new English Renaissance in Art and interior decoration , and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist . Known for his biting wit , flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill , Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day . At the turn of the 1890s , he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays , and incorporated themes of decadence , duplicity , and beauty into what would be his only novel , The Picture of Dorian Gray ( 1890 ) . The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely , and combine them with larger social themes , drew Wilde to write drama .",

  "/wiki/Teleny,_or_The_Reverse_of_the_Medal": "Teleny , or , The Reverse of the Medal , is a pornographic novel , first published in London in 1893 . The authorship of the work is unknown . There is a general consensus that it was an ensemble effort , but it has often been attributed to Oscar Wilde . Set in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris , its concerns are the magnetic attraction and passionate though ultimately tragic affair between a young Frenchman named Camille Des Grieux and the Hungarian pianist Ren\u00e9 Teleny . The novel is one of the earliest pieces of English-language pornography that focuses explicitly and near-exclusively on homosexuality ( following The Sins of the Cities of the Plain , published in 1881 ) . Its lush and literate , though variable prose style and the relative complexity and depth of character and plot development share as much with the Aesthetic fiction of the period as with its typical pornography .",

An English translation by E.A . Lacey was published in 1982 by Gay Sunshine . The novel was the first major literary work on homosexuality to be published in Brazil , and one of the first to have a black person as its hero .

In the second half of the 20th century , the novel has been republished several times in Brazil and translated into English , Spanish , German , French and Italian . While many view the novel as a positive example of social progress in Brazil , it is widely regarded as propaganda with a central message declaring n\u00e3o h\u00e1 lugar para a exist\u00eancia do negro e do homossexual que n\u00e3o o gueto ou a morte , which in English means there is no place for the existence of the black man nor the homosexual if not the ghetto or in death .",
