  "intro": "Croatia, following its independence, made its Paralympic Games d\u00e9but at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona, sending three competitors in swimming, two in shooting and one in track and field. The latter, Milka Milinkovi\u0107, won Croatia's first Paralympic medal, and its only medal of the 1992 Games - a bronze in the women's javelin (THW5 category). Croatia has taken part in every subsequent edition of the Summer Paralympics. It first participated in the Winter Paralympics in 2002, with two representatives in alpine skiing, and has entered every edition of the Winter Games since then. Croatians have won a total of twenty-one Paralympic medals, of which six gold, five silver and ten bronze. Nineteen of these medals have been won at the Summer Games, in track and field, swimming or table tennis. And with the exception of Milinkovi\u0107's early bronze, all have been won from 2004 games onwards. At the Winter Games Croatia has won two medals, gold in alpine skiing and bronze in snowboarding."
