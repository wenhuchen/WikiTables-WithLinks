  "/wiki/Perfect_fifth": "In music theory , a perfect fifth is the musical interval corresponding to a pair of pitches with a frequency ratio of 3:2 , or very nearly so . In classical music from Western culture , a fifth is the interval from the first to the last of five consecutive notes in a diatonic scale . The perfect fifth ( often abbreviated P5 ) spans seven semitones , while the diminished fifth spans six and the augmented fifth spans eight semitones . For example , the interval from C to G is a perfect fifth , as the note G lies seven semitones above C.Play ( help\u00b7info ) The perfect fifth may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the second and third harmonics . In a diatonic scale , the dominant note is a perfect fifth above the tonic note . The perfect fifth is more consonant , or stable , than any other interval except the unison and the octave . It occurs above the root of all major and minor chords ( triads ) and their extensions . Until the late 19th century , it was often referred to by one of its Greek names , diapente . Its inversion is the perfect fourth . The octave of the fifth is the twelfth . A perfect fifth is at the start of Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star ; the pitch of the first twinkle is the root note and pitch of the second twinkle is a perfect fifth above it .",

  "/wiki/Perfect_fourth": "A fourth is a musical interval encompassing four staff positions in the music notation of Western culture , and a perfect fourth ( Play ( help\u00b7info ) ) is the fourth spanning five semitones ( half steps , or half tones ) . For example , the ascending interval from C to the next F is a perfect fourth , because the note F is the fifth semitone above C , and there are four staff positions between C and F. Diminished and augmented fourths span the same number of staff positions , but consist of a different number of semitones ( four and six , respectively ) . The perfect fourth may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the third and fourth harmonics . The term perfect identifies this interval as belonging to the group of perfect intervals , so called because they are neither major nor minor ( unlike thirds , which are either minor or major ) but perfect . A perfect fourth in just intonation corresponds to a pitch ratio of 4:3 , or about 498 cents ( Play ( help\u00b7info ) ) , while in equal temperament a perfect fourth is equal to five semitones , or 500 cents ( see additive synthesis ) . Until the late 19th century , the perfect fourth was often called by its Greek name , diatessaron . Its most common occurrence is between the fifth and upper root of all major and minor triads and their extensions . An example of a perfect fourth is the beginning of the Bridal Chorus from Wagner 's Lohengrin ( Treulich gef\u00fchrt , the colloquially-titled Here Comes the Bride ) . Other examples are the first two notes of the Christmas carol Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing and El C\u00f3ndor Pasa , and , for a descending perfect fourth , the second and third notes of O Come All Ye Faithful . [ citation needed ] The perfect fourth is a perfect interval like the unison , octave , and perfect fifth , and it is a sensory consonance . In common practice harmony , however , it is considered a stylistic dissonance in certain contexts , namely in two-voice textures and whenever it appears above the bass .",

  "/wiki/Major_third": "In classical music from Western culture , a third is a musical interval encompassing three staff positions ( see Interval number for more details ) , and the major third ( Play ( help\u00b7info ) ) is a third spanning four semitones . Along with the minor third , the major third is one of two commonly occurring thirds . It is qualified as major because it is the larger of the two : the major third spans four semitones , the minor third three . For example , the interval from C to E is a major third , as the note E lies four semitones above C , and there are three staff positions from C to E. Diminished and augmented thirds span the same number of staff positions , but consist of a different number of semitones ( two and five ) . The major third may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the fourth and fifth harmonics . The major scale is so named because of the presence of this interval between its tonic and mediant ( 1st and 3rd ) scale degrees . The major chord also takes its name from the presence of this interval built on the chord 's root ( provided that the interval of a perfect fifth from the root is also present or implied ) . A major third is slightly different in different musical tunings : in just intonation corresponds to a pitch ratio of 5:4 ( play ( help\u00b7info ) ) ( fifth harmonic in relation to the fourth ) or 386.31 cents ; in equal temperament , a major third is equal to four semitones , a ratio of 21/3:1 ( about 1.2599 ) or 400 cents , 13.69 cents wider than the 5:4 ratio . The older concept of a ditone ( two 9:8 major seconds ) made a dissonantly wide major third with the ratio 81:64 ( 408 cents ) ( play ( help\u00b7info ) ) . The septimal major third is 9:7 ( 435 cents ) , the undecimal major third is 14:11 ( 418 cents ) , and the tridecimal major third is 13:10 ( 454 cents ) . A helpful way to recognize a major third is to hum the first two notes of Kumbaya or of When the Saints Go Marching In . A descending major third is heard at the starts of Goodnight , Ladies and Swing Low , Sweet Chariot .",

  "/wiki/Major_tenth": "In music , the third factor of a chord is the note or pitch two scale degrees above the root or tonal center . When the third is the bass note , or lowest note , of the expressed triad , the chord is in first inversion Play ( help\u00b7info ) . Conventionally , the third is third in importance to the root and fifth , with the third in all primary triads ( I , IV , V and i , iv , v ) being either major or minor . In jazz chords and theory , the third is required due to it determining chord quality . The third in both major and augmented chords is major ( E\u266e in C ) and the third in both minor and diminished chords is minor ( E\u266d in C ) .",

  "/wiki/Major_sixth": "In music from Western culture , a sixth is a musical interval encompassing six note letter names or staff positions ( see Interval number for more details ) , and the major sixth is one of two commonly occurring sixths . It is qualified as major because it is the larger of the two . The major sixth spans nine semitones . Its smaller counterpart , the minor sixth , spans eight semitones . For example , the interval from C up to the nearest A is a major sixth . It is a sixth because it encompasses six note letter names ( C , D , E , F , G , A ) and six staff positions . It is a major sixth , not a minor sixth , because the note A lies nine semitones above C. Diminished and augmented sixths ( such as C\u266f to A\u266d and C to A\u266f ) span the same number of note letter names and staff positions , but consist of a different number of semitones ( seven and ten ) . A commonly cited example of a melody featuring the major sixth as its opening is My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean . The major sixth is one of the consonances of common practice music , along with the unison , octave , perfect fifth , major and minor thirds , minor sixth , and ( sometimes ) the perfect fourth . In the common practice period , sixths were considered interesting and dynamic consonances along with their inverses the thirds . In medieval times theorists always described them as Pythagorean major sixths of 27/16 and therefore considered them dissonances unusable in a stable final sonority . We can not know how major sixths actually were sung in the Middle Ages .",

  "/wiki/Septimal_tritone": "A septimal tritone is a tritone ( about one half of an octave ) that involves the factor seven . There are two that are inverses . The lesser septimal tritone ( also Huygens ' tritone ) is the musical interval with ratio 7:5 ( 582.51 cents ) . The greater septimal tritone ( also Euler 's tritone ) , is an interval with ratio 10:7 ( 617.49 cents ) . They are also known as the sub-fifth and super-fourth , or subminor fifth and supermajor fourth , respectively . The 7:5 interval ( diminished fifth ) is equal to a 6:5 minor third plus a 7:6 subminor third . The 10:7 interval ( augmented fourth ) is equal to a 5:4 major third plus an 8:7 supermajor second , or a 9:7 supermajor third plus a 10:9 major second . The difference between these two is the septimal sixth tone ( 50:49 , 34.98 cents ) Play ( help\u00b7info ) . 12 equal temperament and 22 equal temperament do not distinguish between these tritones ; 19 equal temperament does distinguish them but does n't match them closely . 31 equal temperament and 41 equal temperament both distinguish between and closely match them . The lesser septimal tritone is the most consonant tritone when measured by combination tones , harmonic entropy , and period length . Depending on the temperament used , the tritone , defined as three whole tones , may be identified as either a lesser septimal tritone ( in septimal meantone systems ) , a greater septimal tritone ( when the tempered fifth is around 703 cents ) , neither ( as in 72 equal temperament ) , or both ( in 12 equal temperament only ) .",

  "/wiki/Major_second": "In Western music theory , a major second ( sometimes also called whole tone ) is a second spanning two semitones ( Play ( help\u00b7info ) ) . A second is a musical interval encompassing two adjacent staff positions ( see Interval number for more details ) . For example , the interval from C to D is a major second , as the note D lies two semitones above C , and the two notes are notated on adjacent staff positions . Diminished , minor and augmented seconds are notated on adjacent staff positions as well , but consist of a different number of semitones ( zero , one , and three ) . The major second is the interval that occurs between the first and second degrees of a major scale , the tonic and the supertonic . On a musical keyboard , a major second is the interval between two keys separated by one key , counting white and black keys alike . On a guitar string , it is the interval separated by two frets . In moveable-do solf\u00e8ge , it is the interval between do and re . It is considered a melodic step , as opposed to larger intervals called skips . Intervals composed of two semitones , such as the major second and the diminished third , are also called tones , whole tones , or whole steps . In just intonation , major seconds can occur in at least two different frequency ratios : 9:8 ( about 203.9 cents ) and 10:9 ( about 182.4 cents ) . The largest ( 9:8 ) ones are called major tones or greater tones , the smallest ( 10:9 ) are called minor tones or lesser tones .",

The size of a ditone varies according to the sizes of the two tones of which it is compounded .

  "/wiki/Pythagorean_interval": "In musical tuning theory , a Pythagorean interval is a musical interval with frequency ratio equal to a power of two divided by a power of three , or vice versa . For instance , the perfect fifth with ratio 3/2 ( equivalent to 31/21 ) and the perfect fourth with ratio 4/3 ( equivalent to 22/31 ) are Pythagorean intervals . All the intervals between the notes of a scale are Pythagorean if they are tuned using the Pythagorean tuning system . However , some Pythagorean intervals are also used in other tuning systems . For instance , the above-mentioned Pythagorean perfect fifth and fourth are also used in just intonation .",
