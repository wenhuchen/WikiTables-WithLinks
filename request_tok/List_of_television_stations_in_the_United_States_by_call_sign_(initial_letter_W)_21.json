Most viewers in Canada have access to at least one U.S.-based Fox affiliate , either free-to-air or through a pay television provider , although Fox 's National Football League broadcasts and most of its prime time programming are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for pay television providers imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) to protect rights held by domestically based networks . Fox is named after what was once called 20th Century Fox , its original corporate sibling ( and still its major supplier of programming , despite its acquisition by Disney ) and indirectly for producer William Fox , who founded one of the movie studio 's predecessors , Fox Film .
