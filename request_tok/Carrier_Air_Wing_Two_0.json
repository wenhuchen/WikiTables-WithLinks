  "/wiki/Boeing_F/A-18E/F_Super_Hornet": "The Boeing F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornet are twin-engine , carrier-capable , multirole fighter aircraft variants based on the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet . The F/A-18E single-seat and F/A-18F tandem-seat variants are larger and more advanced derivatives of the F/A-18C and D Hornet . The Super Hornet has an internal 20 mm M61 rotary cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface weapons . Additional fuel can be carried in up to five external fuel tanks and the aircraft can be configured as an airborne tanker by adding an external air refueling system . Designed and initially produced by McDonnell Douglas , the Super Hornet first flew in 1995 . Low-rate production began in early 1997 with full-rate production starting in September 1997 , after the merger of McDonnell Douglas and Boeing the previous month . The Super Hornet entered service with the United States Navy in 2001 , replacing the Grumman F-14 Tomcat , which was retired in 2006 ; the Super Hornet serves alongside the original Hornet . The Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , which has operated the F/A-18A as its main fighter since 1984 , ordered the F/A-18F in 2007 to replace its aging F-111C fleet . RAAF Super Hornets entered service in December 2010 .",

  "/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II": "The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a family of single-seat , single-engine , all-weather , stealth multirole combat aircraft , designed for ground-attack and air-superiority missions . The aircraft was developed and is built by Lockheed Martin and its subcontractors , which include Northrop Grumman , Pratt & Whitney , and BAE Systems . The F-35 has three main variants : the conventional takeoff and landing F-35A ( CTOL ) , the short take-off and vertical-landing F-35B ( STOVL ) , and the carrier-based F-35C ( CV ) . The aircraft descends from the Lockheed Martin X-35 , which in 2001 beat the Boeing X-32 to win the Joint Strike Fighter ( JSF ) program . Its development is principally funded by the United States , with additional funding coming from program partners from NATO and close U.S. allies , including the United Kingdom , Italy , Australia , Canada , Norway , Denmark , the Netherlands , and formerly Turkey . The partners generally receive subcontracts to manufacture F-35 components . [ N 1 ] Several other countries have ordered , or are considering ordering , the aircraft . The program has drawn much scrutiny and criticism for its unprecedented size , complexity , ballooning costs , and much-delayed deliveries . The decision to start buying the plane while it was still in development and testing led to expensive design changes and retrofits . By 2014 , the program was US $ 163 billion over budget [ and ] seven years behind schedule . Critics contended that the high sunk costs and politics made the F-35 too big to kill . The F-35B entered service with the U.S. Marine Corps in July 2015 , followed by the U.S. Air Force F-35A in August 2016 and the U.S. Navy F-35C in February 2019 .",

  "/wiki/E-2_Hawkeye": "The Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye is an American all-weather , carrier-capable tactical airborne early warning ( AEW ) aircraft . This twin-turboprop aircraft was designed and developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s by the Grumman Aircraft Company for the United States Navy as a replacement for the earlier , piston-engined E-1 Tracer , which was rapidly becoming obsolete . The aircraft 's performance has been upgraded with the E-2B , and E-2C versions , where most of the changes were made to the radar and radio communications due to advances in electronic integrated circuits and other electronics . The fourth major version of the Hawkeye is the E-2D , which first flew in 2007 . The E-2 was the first aircraft designed specifically for its role , as opposed to a modification of an existing airframe , such as the Boeing E-3 Sentry . Variants of the Hawkeye have been in continuous production since 1960 , giving it the longest production run of any carrier-based aircraft . The E-2 also received the nickname Super Fudd because it replaced the WF ( later E-1 ) Willy Fudd . In recent decades , the E-2 has been commonly referred to as the Hummer because of the distinctive sounds of its turboprop engines , quite unlike that of turbojet and turbofan jet engines . In addition to U.S. Navy service , smaller numbers of E-2s have been sold to the armed forces of Egypt , France , Israel , Japan , Mexico , Singapore , and Taiwan .",
