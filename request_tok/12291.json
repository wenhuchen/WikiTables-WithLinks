  "/wiki/Whitewater_River_(Great_Miami_River)": "The Whitewater River is a 101-mile-long ( 163 km ) southerly flowing right tributary of the Great Miami River in southeastern Indiana and southwestern Ohio in the United States . It is formed by the confluence of two forks , the West Fork and East Fork . The name is a misnomer , as there is no true white water on the river . However , there are many rapids due to the steep gradient present - the river falls an average of six feet per mile ( 1.1 m/km ) . The gradient rendered upstream navigation impossible , and in the mid-nineteenth century resulted in the construction of the Whitewater Canal paralleling the river from north of Connersville , Indiana , to the Ohio River . The West Fork , shown as the main stem of the river on federal maps , rises in Randolph County , Indiana , approximately 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) northeast of Modoc . It flows 69.5 miles ( 111.8 km ) south and southeast , past Hagerstown and Connersville , and joins the East Fork of the river at Brookville , Indiana . The 56.7-mile-long ( 91.2 km ) East Fork rises in Darke County , Ohio , approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) northwest of New Paris . It flows south , through Richmond , Indiana , and joins the West Fork of the river at Brookville , Indiana . From the junction the Whitewater flows southeasterly into Ohio where it eventually joins the Miami River , a tributary of the Ohio River . Following continual flooding problems on the East Fork , and to help control flooding in the Ohio River , the East Fork was dammed by the US Army Corps of Engineers to create Brookville Lake in 1974 . Brookville Lake extends 17 miles ( 27 km ) from just south of Liberty , Indiana , to Brookville .",
