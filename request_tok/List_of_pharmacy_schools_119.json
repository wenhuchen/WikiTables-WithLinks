Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire , Bradford rose to prominence in the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture , particularly wool . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and amongst the earliest industrialised settlements , rapidly becoming the wool capital of the world . The area 's access to a supply of coal , iron ore and soft water facilitated the growth of Bradford 's manufacturing base , which , as textile manufacture grew , led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment ; Bradford has a large amount of listed Victorian architecture including the grand Italianate City Hall . The textile sector in Bradford fell into decline from the mid-20th century . Bradford has since emerged as a tourist destination , becoming the first UNESCO City of Film with attractions such as the National Science and Media Museum , Bradford City Park , the Alhambra theatre and Cartwright Hall . Bradford has faced similar challenges to the rest of post-industrial Northern England , including deindustrialisation , social unrest and economic deprivation .",
