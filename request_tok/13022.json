  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

  "/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States": "Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is the title of all members of the Supreme Court of the United States other than the chief justice of the United States . The number of associate justices is eight , as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 . Article II , Section 2 , Clause 2 of the United States Constitution grants plenary power to the president to nominate , and with the advice and consent ( confirmation ) of the Senate , appoint justices to the Supreme Court . Article III , Section 1 of the Constitution effectively grants life tenure to associate justices , and all other federal judges , which ends only when a justice dies , retires , resigns , or is removed from office by impeachment . Each Supreme Court justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it ; the chief justice 's vote counts no more than that of any other justice . However , the chief justice - when in the majority - decides who writes the court 's opinion . Otherwise , the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision . Furthermore , the chief justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices . The chief justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other justices do not and is paid slightly more ( $ 267,000 per year as of 2018 , as opposed to $ 255,300 per year for each associate justice ) .

It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law . However , it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones , but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions . Established by Article III of the Constitution , the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 . As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it .

  "/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)": "The Whig Party was a political party active in the middle of the 19th century in the United States of America . Alongside the Democratic Party , it was one of the two major parties in the United States during the late 1830s , the 1840s , and the early 1850s , part of the Second Party System . Four U.S. presidents were affiliated with the Whig party for at least part of their respective terms . Other influential party leaders include Henry Clay , Daniel Webster , William Seward , John J. Crittenden , and Truman Smith . The Whigs emerged in the 1830s in opposition to President Andrew Jackson , pulling together former members of the National Republican Party , the Anti-Masonic Party , and disaffected Democrats . The Whigs had some links to the defunct Federalist Party , but the Whig Party was not a direct successor to that party and many Whig leaders , including Clay , had aligned with the rival Democratic-Republican Party . In the 1836 presidential election , four different Whig candidates received electoral votes , but the party failed to defeat Jackson 's chosen successor , Martin Van Buren . Whig nominee William Henry Harrison unseated Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election , but died just one month into his term . Harrison 's successor , John Tyler , was expelled from the party in 1841 after clashing with Clay and other Whig Party leaders over economic policies such as the re-establishment of a national bank . Clay won his party 's nomination in the 1844 presidential election but was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk , who subsequently presided over the Mexican-American War . Whig nominee Zachary Taylor won the 1848 presidential election , but Taylor died in 1850 and was succeeded by Millard Fillmore . Fillmore , Clay , Daniel Webster , and Democrat Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Compromise of 1850 , which helped to defuse sectional tensions in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War .",
