  "/wiki/1876_in_baseball": "After a tumultuous five-year existence , the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players ( NA ) folded following the 1875 season . The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs ( NL ) was formed in Chicago , Illinois by businessman , and owner of the Chicago White Stockings ( now known as , the Chicago Cubs ) , William Hulbert , for the purpose of replacing the NA , which he believed to have been corrupt , mismanaged , full of rowdy , drunken ballplayers , and under the influence of the gambling community . One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more . The initial NL season began with eight teams , and they were asked to play seventy games between April 22 and October 21 .
