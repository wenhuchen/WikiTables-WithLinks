  "/wiki/Patents": "A patent is a form of intellectual property that gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making , using , selling and importing an invention for a limited period of years , in exchange for publishing an enabling public disclosure of the invention . In most countries patent rights fall under civil law and the patent holder needs to sue someone infringing the patent in order to enforce his or her rights . In some industries patents are an essential form of competitive advantage ; in others they are irrelevant . :17 The procedure for granting patents , requirements placed on the patentee , and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements . Typically , however , a patent application must include one or more claims that define the invention . A patent may include many claims , each of which defines a specific property right . These claims must meet relevant patentability requirements , such as novelty , usefulness , and non-obviousness . Under the World Trade Organization 's ( WTO ) TRIPS Agreement , patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention , in all fields of technology , provided they are new , involve an inventive step , and are capable of industrial application . Nevertheless , there are variations on what is patentable subject matter from country to country , also among WTO member states . TRIPS also provides that the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years .",
  "/wiki/Streaming_media": "Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being delivered by a provider . The verb to stream refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner ; [ clarification needed ] the term refers to the delivery method of the medium , rather than the medium itself , and is an alternative to file downloading , a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it . A client end-user can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before the entire file has been transmitted . Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to telecommunications networks , as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming ( e.g . radio , television , streaming apps ) or inherently non-streaming ( e.g . books , video cassettes , audio CDs ) . For example , in the 1930s , elevator music was among the earliest popular music available as streaming media ; nowadays Internet television is a common form of streamed media . The term streaming media can apply to media other than video and audio , such as live closed captioning , ticker tape , and real-time text , which are all considered streaming text . Live streaming is the delivery of Internet content in real-time much as live television broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal . Live internet streaming requires a form of source media ( e.g . a video camera , an audio interface , screen capture software ) , an encoder to digitize the content , a media publisher , and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content . Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point , although it frequently is .",

Throop in 1891 , the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale , Arthur Amos Noyes and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century . The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1920 . In 1934 , Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities , and the antecedents of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , which Caltech continues to manage and operate , were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n . The university is one among a small group of institutes of technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences . Caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering , managing $ 332 million in 2011 in sponsored research . Its 124-acre ( 50 ha ) primary campus is located approximately 11 mi ( 18 km ) northeast of downtown Los Angeles . First-year students are required to live on campus and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus House System at Caltech . Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks , student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations .

The act of engaging in activities ( such as programming or other media ) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking . However , the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves ( e.g . programming ) , but the manner in which it is done and whether it is something exciting and meaningful . Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have hack value and therefore the term hacks came about , with early examples including pranks at MIT done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness . Therefore , the hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) 's Tech Model Railroad Club ( TMRC ) and MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory . Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damages . Some famous hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into R2-D2 .

He has been described as one of modern crime writing 's best practitioners , who was a patron saint of the post-Vietnam private eye novel and a cross between Raymond Chandler and Hunter S. Thompson . His book The Last Good Kiss has been described as the most influential crime novel of the last 50 years . Crumley 's first published novel , 1969 's One to Count Cadence , which was set in the Philippines and Vietnam , began as the thesis for his master 's degree in creative writing from the Iowa Writers ' Workshop in 1966 . His novels The Last Good Kiss , The Mexican Tree Duck and The Right Madness feature the character C.W . Sughrue , an alcoholic ex-army officer turned private investigator . The Wrong Case , Dancing Bear and The Final Country feature another P.I. , Milo Milodragovitch . In the novel Bordersnakes , Crumley brought both characters together . Crumley said of his two private detectives : Milo 's first impulse is to help you ; Sughrue 's is to shoot you in the foot . Crumley had a cult following , and his work is said to have inspired a generation of crime writers in both the U.S. and the U.K , including Michael Connelly , George Pelecanos , Dennis Lehane and Craig McDonald , as well as writers from other genres such as Neal Stephenson , but he never achieved mainstream success .

  "/wiki/Comic_strip": "A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative , often serialized , with text in balloons and captions . Traditionally , throughout the 20th century and into the 21st , these have been published in newspapers and magazines , with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers , while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections . With the development of the internet , they began to appear online as webcomics . There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century , for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes . Strips are written and drawn by a comics artist/cartoonist . As the name implies , comic strips can be humorous ( for example , gag-a-day strips such as Blondie , Bringing Up Father , Marmaduke , and Pearls Before Swine ) . Starting in the late 1920s , comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories , as seen in Popeye , Captain Easy , Buck Rogers , Tarzan , and Terry and the Pirates . Soap-opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity in the 1940s . All are called , generically , comic strips , though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that sequential art would be a better genre-neutral name . In the UK and the rest of Europe , comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines , with a strip 's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more . Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as Liberty and Boys ' Life and also on the front covers of magazines , such as the Flossy Frills series on The American Weekly Sunday newspaper supplement .",

It is located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Western United States , with the Midwestern United States and Northeastern United States to its north and the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to its south . The South does not fully match the geographic south of the United States but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War . The Deep South is fully located in the southeastern corner . California , Arizona and New Mexico , which are geographically in the southern part of the country , are rarely considered part , while West Virginia , which separated from Virginia in 1863 , commonly is . Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries . While the states of Delaware and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia , permitted slavery prior to and during the Civil War , they remained with the Union . Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s , they became more culturally , economically , and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states , and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents , businesses , public institutions , and private organizations ; however , the United States Census Bureau continues to define them as in the South with regard to census regions . Usually , the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States . The region is known for its culture and history , having developed its own customs , musical styles , and cuisines , which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the United States . The Southern ethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong European ( mostly English , Italian , Scottish , Scotch-Irish , Irish , German , French , Portuguese and Spanish American ) , African and some Native American components . Some other aspects of the historical and cultural development of the South have been influenced by the institution of slave labor on plantations in the Deep South to an extent seen nowhere else in the United States ; the presence of a large proportion of African Americans in the population ; support for the doctrine of states ' rights , and the legacy of racism magnified by the Civil War and Reconstruction Era , as seen in thousands of lynchings ( mostly from 1880 to 1930 ) , the segregated system of separate schools and public facilities known as Jim Crow laws , that lasted until the 1960s , and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to frequently deny black people of the right to vote or hold office until the 1960s .",

Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre , of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer since the 1960s when it exceeded the American film industry 's total musical output after musical films declined in the West ; the first Indian musical talkie was Alam Ara ( 1931 ) , several years after the first Hollywood musical talkie The Jazz Singer ( 1927 ) .

  "/wiki/Woodturning": "Woodturning is the craft of using the wood lathe with hand-held tools to cut a shape that is symmetrical around the axis of rotation . Like the potter 's wheel , the wood lathe is a simple mechanism which can generate a variety of forms . The operator is known as a turner , and the skills needed to use the tools were traditionally known as turnery . In pre-industrial England , these skills were sufficiently difficult to be known as 'the misterie ' of the turners guild . The skills to use the tools by hand , without a fixed point of contact with the wood , distinguish woodturning and the wood lathe from the machinists lathe , or metal-working lathe . Items made on the lathe include tool handles , candlesticks , egg cups , knobs , lamps , rolling pins , cylindrical boxes , Christmas ornaments , bodkins , knitting needles , needle cases , thimbles , pens , chessmen , spinning tops ; legs , spindles and pegs for furniture ; balusters and newel posts for architecture ; baseball bats , hollow forms such as woodwind musical instruments , urns , sculptures ; bowls , platters , and chair seats . Industrial production has replaced many of these products from the traditional turning shop . However , the wood lathe is still used for decentralized production of limited or custom turnings . A skilled turner can produce a wide variety of objects with five or six simple tools . The tools can be reshaped easily for the task at hand . In many parts of the world , the lathe has been a portable tool that goes to the source of the wood , or adapts to temporary workspaces . 21st-century turners restore furniture , continue folk-art traditions , produce custom architectural work , and create fine craft for galleries .",

  "/wiki/Industrial_Design": "Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production . Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture : the creative act of determining and defining a product 's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product , which consists purely of repeated , often automated , replication . This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design , where the form of the product is determined by the product 's creator at the time of its creation . All manufactured products are the result of a design process , but the nature of this process can take many forms : it can be conducted by an individual or a large team ; it can emphasize intuitive creativity or calculated scientific decision-making , and often emphasizes both at the same time ; and it can be influenced by factors as varied as materials , production processes , business strategy , and prevailing social , commercial , or aesthetic attitudes . The role of an industrial designer is to create and execute design solutions for problems of form , function , usability , physical ergonomics , marketing , brand development , sustainability , and sales .",
