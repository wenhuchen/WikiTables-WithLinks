  "intro": "The vastness of Canada's Northwest Territories (spelled 'North-West Territories' from 1870 to 1905) meant that for much of its history it was divided into several districts for ease of administration. The number and size of these territorial districts varied as other provinces and territories of Canada were created and expanded. The districts of the Northwest Territories were abolished in 1999 with the creation of Nunavut territory and the contraction of the Northwest Territories to its current size."
