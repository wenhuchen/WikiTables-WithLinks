  "/wiki/Berwickshire": "Berwickshire is a historic county , registration county and lieutenancy area in the Scottish Borders . It takes its name from Berwick-upon-Tweed , which was part of Scotland at the time of the county 's formation , but became part of England in 1482 after several centuries of being fought over and swapping back and forth between the two kingdoms . Formerly the county was often called the Merse , from Old English m\u01e3res , border . From 1596 to 1890 the county town was Greenlaw . However , this was changed to Duns by the Local Government ( Scotland ) Act 1889 , the act which established the system of county councils in Scotland . The county borders Midlothian to the west , East Lothian to the north , the North Sea to the east and Roxburghshire and the English county of Northumberland to the south .",
  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_England": "The Kingdom of England ( Anglo-Norman : Realme d'Engleterre , French : Royaume d'Angleterre ) was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from 927 , when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms until 1707 , when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain . On 12 July 927 , the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were united by \u00c6thelstan ( r. 927-939 ) to form the Kingdom of England . In 1016 , the kingdom became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre . Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066-1154 , Plantagenet 1154-1485 , Tudor 1485-1603 and Stuart 1603-1707 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649-1660 ) . Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became more English in nature ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor . The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327-1377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government - in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558-1603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World . From the accession of James VI and I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland .",

The market town , surrounded by rich farmland , grew up connecting the royal citadel , the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen , the bridge and the port . Located on the River Forth , Stirling is the administrative centre for the Stirling council area , and is traditionally the county town of Stirlingshire . Proverbially it is the strategically important Gateway to the Highlands . It has been said that Stirling , like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together . Similarly he who holds Stirling , holds Scotland is often quoted . Stirling 's key position as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth made it a focal point for travel north or south . When Stirling was temporarily under Anglo-Saxon sway , according to a 9th-century legend , it was attacked by Danish invaders . The sound of a wolf roused a sentry , however , who alerted his garrison , which forced a Viking retreat . This led to the wolf being adopted as a symbol of the town as is shown on the 1511 Stirling Jug . The area is today known as Wolfcraig . Even today the wolf appears with a goshawk on the council 's coat of arms along with the recently chosen motto : Steadfast as the Rock .",

Though it did not bring overall victory in the war , which would go on for 14 more years , it was a landmark in Scottish history . King Edward invaded Scotland after Bruce demanded in 1313 that all supporters still loyal to ousted Scottish king John Balliol acknowledge Bruce as their king or lose their lands . Stirling Castle , a Scots royal fortress occupied by the English , was under siege by the Scottish army . King Edward assembled a formidable force of soldiers from England , Ireland and Wales to relieve it - the largest army ever to invade Scotland . This attempt failed when he found his path blocked by a smaller army commanded by Bruce . The Scottish army was divided into three divisions of schiltrons commanded by Bruce , his brother Edward Bruce , and his nephew , the Earl of Moray . After Robert Bruce killed Sir Henry de Bohun on the first day of the battle , the English were forced to withdraw for the night . Sir Alexander Seton , a Scottish noble serving in Edward 's army , defected to the Scottish side and informed them of the English camp 's position and low morale . Robert Bruce decided to launch a full-scale attack on the English forces and to use his schiltrons again as offensive units , a strategy his predecessor William Wallace had not used .

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland , Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland . In 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30% of the island 's total population and about 3% of the UK 's population . Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal . Northern Ireland was created in 1921 , when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 . Unlike Southern Ireland , which would become the Irish Free State in 1922 , the majority of Northern Ireland 's population were unionists , who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom . Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned . For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland , David Trimble , called a cold house for Catholics .",
  "/wiki/Lordship_of_Ireland": "The Lordship of Ireland ( Irish : Tiarnas na h\u00c9ireann ) , sometimes referred to retroactively as Norman Ireland , was the part of Ireland ruled by the King of England ( styled as Lord of Ireland ) and controlled by loyal Anglo-Norman lords between 1177 and 1542 . The lordship was created as a Papal fief following the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169-1171 . As the lord of Ireland was also the king of England , he was represented locally by a governor , variously known as justiciar , lieutenant , or Lord Deputy . The kings of England claimed lordship over the whole island , but in reality the king 's rule only ever extended to parts of the island . The rest of the island - known as Gaelic Ireland - remained under the control of various Gaelic Irish kingdoms or chiefdoms , who were often at war with the Anglo-Normans . The area under English rule and law grew and shrank over time , and reached its greatest extent in the late 13th and early 14th centuries . The lordship then went into decline , brought on by its invasion by Scotland in 1315-18 , the Great Famine of 1315-17 , and the Black Death of the 1340s . The fluid political situation and English feudal system allowed a great deal of autonomy for the Anglo-Norman lords in Ireland , who carved out earldoms for themselves and had almost as much authority as some of the native Gaelic kings . Some Anglo-Normans became Gaelicised and rebelled against the English administration . The English attempted to curb this by passing the Statutes of Kilkenny ( 1366 ) , which forbade English settlers from taking up Irish law , language , custom and dress .

Carlisle is located at the confluence of the rivers Eden , Caldew and Petteril , 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of the Scottish border . Originally in the historic county of Cumberland , it is now the largest settlement in the county of Cumbria , and serves as the administrative centre for both Carlisle City Council and Cumbria County Council . At the time of the 2001 census , the population of Carlisle was 71,773 , with 100,734 living in the wider city . Ten years later , at the 2011 census , the city 's population had risen to 75,306 , with 107,524 in the wider city . The early history of Carlisle is marked by its status as a Roman settlement , established to serve the forts on Hadrian 's Wall . During the Middle Ages , because of its proximity to the Kingdom of Scotland , Carlisle became an important military stronghold ; Carlisle Castle , still relatively intact , was built in 1092 by William Rufus , and once served as a prison for Mary , Queen of Scots . The castle now houses the Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment and the Border Regiment Museum . In the early 12th century , Henry I allowed the foundation of a priory in Carlisle . The town gained the status of a city when its diocese was formed in 1133 , and the priory became Carlisle Cathedral . The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution began a process of socioeconomic transformation in Carlisle , which developed into a densely populated mill town . This , combined with its strategic position , allowed for the development of Carlisle as an important railway town , with seven railway companies sharing Carlisle railway station .",
  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel , the Irish Sea , and St George 's Channel . Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles , the third-largest in Europe , and the twentieth-largest on Earth . Geopolitically , Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland ( officially named Ireland ) , which covers five-sixths of the island , and Northern Ireland , which is part of the United Kingdom . In 2011 , the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million , ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain . As of 2016 , 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland , and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland . The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature . Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages . Today , woodland makes up about 10% of the island , compared with a European average of over 33% , and most of it is non-native conifer plantations . There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland . The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate , and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area , although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe .",
