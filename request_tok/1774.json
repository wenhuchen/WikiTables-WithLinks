The motte is to the north of St John 's Church , and the church stands on the site of an infilled bailey ditch . The origin and dates of construction of the castle are uncertain . It is thought initially to have been an earth-and-timber construction , possibly built by Robert de Alford in the mid-12th century , in the time of Henry II , though archaeological evidence of the date is lacking and it may have been significantly earlier . The earliest written records establish that it was in the possession of Richard de Alford in the early 13th century , and after his death in 1213 , of the family of John de Aderne who likely married de Alford 's daughter Margaret . Archaeological findings show that it was rebuilt in stone as a shell keep castle in the 13th century . Some fragments of the stonework around the bailey and significant earthworks survive .

His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders .

  "/wiki/Richard_II_of_England": "Richard II ( 6 January 1367 - c. 14 February 1400 ) , also known as Richard of Bordeaux , was King of England from 1377 until he was deposed in 1399 . He was the eighth king of the House of Plantagenet , and the final one of the direct line . Richard 's father , Edward the Black Prince , died in 1376 , leaving Richard as heir apparent to King Edward III . Upon the death of his grandfather Edward III , the 10-year-old Richard succeeded to the throne . During Richard 's first years as king , government was in the hands of a series of regency councils , influenced by Richard 's uncles John of Gaunt and Thomas of Woodstock . England then faced various problems , most notably the Hundred Years ' War . A major challenge of the reign was the Peasants ' Revolt in 1381 , and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis . Less warlike than either his father or grandfather , he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years ' War . A firm believer in the royal prerogative , Richard restrained the power of the aristocracy and relied on a private retinue for military protection instead . In contrast to his grandfather , Richard cultivated a refined atmosphere at court , in which the king was an elevated figure , with art and culture at its centre . The king 's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential , and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant . By 1389 Richard had regained control , and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents .",

  "/wiki/Owen_Glendower": "Owain ab Gruffydd , lord of Glyndyfrdwy ( c. 1359 - c. 1415 ) , or simply Owain Glynd\u0175r or Glyn D\u0175r ( pronounced [ \u02c8o\u028aain \u0261l\u0268\u031en\u02c8du\u02d0r ] , anglicized to Owen Glendower ) , was a Welsh leader who instigated a fierce and long-running yet ultimately unsuccessful war of independence with the aim of ending English rule in Wales during the Late Middle Ages . He was the last native Welshman to hold the title Prince of Wales ( Welsh : Tywysog Cymru ) . Glynd\u0175r was a descendant of the Princes of Powys through his father Gruffudd Fychan II , hereditary Tywysog of Powys Fadog and Lord of Glyndyfrdwy , and of those of Deheubarth through his mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn ab Owen . On 16 September 1400 , Glynd\u0175r instigated the Welsh Revolt against the rule of Henry IV of England . The uprising was initially very successful and rapidly gained control of large areas of Wales , but it suffered from key weaknesses - particularly a lack of artillery , which made capturing defended fortresses difficult , and of ships , which made rebel-controlled coastlands vulnerable . The uprising was eventually suppressed by the superior resources of the English . Glynd\u0175r was driven from his last remaining strongholds in 1409 , but he avoided capture ; the last documented sighting of him was in 1412 . He twice ignored offers of a pardon from his military nemesis , the new king Henry V of England , and despite the large rewards offered , Glynd\u0175r was never betrayed to the English . His death was recorded by a former follower in the year 1415 . With his death Owain acquired a mythical status along with Cadwaladr , Cynan and Arthur as a folk hero awaiting the call to return and liberate his people . In William Shakespeare 's play Henry IV , Part 1 , the character of Owen Glendower is a wild and exotic king ruled by magic and emotion . In the late 19th century , the Cymru Fydd movement recreated him as the father of Welsh nationalism .",

  "/wiki/Edward_III_of_England": "Edward III ( 13 November 1312 - 21 June 1377 ) was king of England and Lord of Ireland from January 1327 until his death . He was the seventh king of the House of Plantagenet . He is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father , Edward II . Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe . His long reign of 50 years was the second-longest in medieval England ( after that of his great-grandfather Henry III ) and saw vital developments in legislation and government , in particular the evolution of the English Parliament , as well as the ravages of the Black Death . Edward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was deposed by his mother , Isabella of France , and her lover Roger Mortimer . At age seventeen he led a successful coup d'\u00e9tat against Mortimer , the de facto ruler of the country , and began his personal reign . After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 . This started what became known as the Hundred Years ' War . Following some initial setbacks , this first phase of the war went exceptionally well for England ; victories at Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny , in which England made territorial gains , and Edward renounced his claim to the French throne . This phase would become known as the Edwardian War . Edward 's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife , largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health .",

  "/wiki/English_Civil_War": "The English Civil War ( 1642-1651 ) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians ( Roundheads ) and Royalists ( Cavaliers ) principally over the manner of England 's governance . The first ( 1642-1646 ) and second ( 1648-1649 ) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament , while the third ( 1649-1651 ) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament . The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 . The outcome of the war was threefold : the trial and execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) ; the exile of his son , Charles II ( 1651 ) ; and the replacement of English monarchy with , at first , the Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1653 ) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell ( 1653-1658 ) and briefly his son Richard ( 1658-1659 ) . A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy . Constitutionally , the wars established the precedent that an English monarch can not govern without Parliament 's consent , although the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was only legally established as part of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 ."
