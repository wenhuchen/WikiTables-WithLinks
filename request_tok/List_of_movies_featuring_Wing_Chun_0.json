Referring to himself as a consulting detective in the stories , Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation , deduction , forensic science , and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic , which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients , including Scotland Yard . First appearing in print in 1887 's A Study in Scarlet , the character 's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine , beginning with A Scandal in Bohemia in 1891 ; additional tales appeared from then until 1927 , eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories . All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras , between about 1880 and 1914 . Most are narrated by the character of Holmes 's friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson , who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street , London , where many of the stories begin . Though not the first fictional detective , Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known . By the 1990s there were already over 25,000 stage adaptations , films , television productions and publications featuring the detective , and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history . Holmes 's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual ; numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretense . Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of fandom . The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole , with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays , television , films , video games , and other media for over one hundred years .",
