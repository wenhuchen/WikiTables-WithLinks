Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and the east , Iraq to the north-east , Syria to the north and Israel and the Palestinian West Bank to the west . The Dead Sea is located along its western borders and the country has a 26-kilometre ( 16 mi ) coastline on the Red Sea in its extreme south-west . Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia , Africa and Europe . The capital , Amman , is Jordan 's most populous city as well as the country 's economic , political and cultural centre . What is now Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period . Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the Bronze Age : Ammon , Moab and Edom . Later rulers include the Nabataean Kingdom , the Roman Empire , and the Ottoman Empire . After the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916 during World War I , the Ottoman Empire was partitioned by Britain and France . The Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the Hashemite , then Emir , Abdullah I , and the emirate became a British protectorate . In 1946 , Jordan became an independent state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan , but was renamed in 1949 to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan after the country captured the West Bank during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in 1967 . Jordan renounced its claim to the territory in 1988 , and became one of two Arab states to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 .",

With a population of 4,007,526 , Amman is the largest city in the Levant region and the fifth-largest city in the Arab world . It is considered to be among the most modernized Arab cities and a major tourist destination . The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman is in a Neolithic site known as 'Ain Ghazal , where some of the oldest human statues ever found dating to 7250 BC were uncovered . During the Iron Age , the city was known as Ammon , home to the Kingdom of the Ammonites . It was named Philadelphia during its Greek and Roman periods , and was finally called Amman during the Islamic period . Abandoned for much of the medieval and post-medieval period , modern Amman dates to the late 19th century when Circassian immigrants were settled there by the Ottoman Empire in 1867 . The first municipal council was established in 1909 . Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan 's capital in 1921 , and after several successive waves of refugees : Palestinians in 1948 and 1967 ; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003 ; and Syrians since 2011 . It was initially built on seven hills but now spans over 19 hills combining 27 districts , which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality headed by its mayor Yousef Shawarbeh . Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills ( Jabal ) or the valleys ( Wadi ) they occupy , such as Jabal Lweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun . East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities , while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city .",

A country of fertile plains , high mountains , and deserts , Syria is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups , including Syrian Arabs , Kurds , Turkemens , Assyrians , Armenians , Circassians , Mandeans and Greeks . Religious groups include Sunnis , Christians , Alawites , Druze , Isma'ilis , Mandeans , Shiites , Salafis , Yazidis , and Jews . Arabs are the largest ethnic group , and Sunnis the largest religious group . Syria is a unitary republic consisting of 14 governorates and is the only country that politically espouses Ba'athism . It is a member of one international organization other than the United Nations , the Non-Aligned Movement ; it was suspended from the Arab League in November 2011 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean . The name Syria historically referred to a wider region , broadly synonymous with the Levant , and known in Arabic as al-Sham . The modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires , including the Eblan civilization of the 3rd millennium BC . Aleppo and the capital city Damascus are among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world . In the Islamic era , Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt . The modern Syrian state was established in the mid-20th century after centuries of Ottoman and a brief period French mandate , and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Syrian provinces . It gained de jure independence as a parliamentary republic on 24 October 1945 , when Republic of Syria became a founding member of the United Nations , an act which legally ended the former French Mandate - although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946 .",

With an official population of 4.6 million in 2010 , Aleppo was the largest Syrian city before the Syrian Civil War ; however , it is now the second-largest city in Syria , after the capital Damascus . [ citation needed ] Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world ; it may have been inhabited since the 6th millennium BC . Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari , just south of the old city of Aleppo , show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the 3rd millennium BC . That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia , which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad , and note its commercial and military proficiency . Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center midway between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia . For centuries , Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region , and the Ottoman Empire 's third-largest after Constantinople and Cairo . The city 's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road , which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia . When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869 , much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline . At the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I , Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey , as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul . In the 1940s it lost its main access to the sea , Antakya and \u0130skenderun , likewise to Turkey . Finally , the isolation of Syria in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation .",

It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south , while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea . Lebanon 's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity . At just 10,452 km2 ( 4,036 mi2 ) , it is the smallest recognized sovereign state on the mainland Asian continent . [ nb 4 ] The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years , predating recorded history . Lebanon was the home of the Canaanites/Phoenicians and their kingdoms , a maritime culture that flourished for almost three thousand years ( c. 3200-539 BC ) . In 64 BC , the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire , and eventually became one of the Empire 's leading centers of Christianity . In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established . As the Arab Muslims conquered the region , the Maronites held onto their religion and identity . However , a new religious group , the Druze , established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well , generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries . During the Crusades , the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome . The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era .",

It is one of the oldest cities in the world , and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions - Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital , as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power ; however , neither claim is widely recognized internationally . [ note 3 ] During its long history , Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice , besieged 23 times , captured and recaptured 44 times , and attacked 52 times . The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE , in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds . Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets , probably meaning City of Shalem after a Canaanite deity , during the Canaanite period ( 14th century BCE ) . During the Israelite period , significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE ( Iron Age II ) , and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah . In 1538 , the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent . Today those walls define the Old City , which has been traditionally divided into four quarters - known since the early 19th century as the Armenian , Christian , Jewish , and Muslim Quarters .

The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the Ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years . Under the Romans - in their pagan form as well as after the Christianisation of their empire , for which historians use the term Byzantine Empire - Gaza experienced relative peace and its port flourished . In 635 CE , it became the first city in Palestine to be conquered by the Muslim Rashidun army and quickly developed into a center of Islamic law . However , by the time the Crusaders invaded the country starting in 1099 , Gaza was in ruins . In later centuries , Gaza experienced several hardships - from Mongol raids to floods and locusts , reducing it to a village by the 16th century , when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire . During the first half of Ottoman rule , the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza and under them the city went through an age of great commerce and peace . The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893 . Gaza fell to British forces during World War I , becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine . As a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War , Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city .
