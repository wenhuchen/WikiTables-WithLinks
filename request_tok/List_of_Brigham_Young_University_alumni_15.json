The Early Show , like many of its predecessors , traditionally placed third in the ratings , behind NBC 's Today and ABC 's Good Morning America . Much like Today and its fellow NBC program The Tonight Show , the Early Show title was analogous to that of CBS 's late-night talk show , the Late Show . Unlike CBS ' other attempts at a morning news program ( which emphasize hard news ) , The Early Show followed the format of its two other competitors , which have long used a lighter soft news , lifestyle and infotainment approach . On November 15 , 2011 , CBS announced the cancellation of The Early Show , and replacement by a new morning program that CBS News chairman Jeff Fager and president David Rhodes stated would redefine the morning television landscape . The Early Show ended its twelve-year run on January 6 , 2012 , replaced three days later on January 9 by the second version of CBS This Morning .",
