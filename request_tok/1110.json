For his scientific works he is regarded as the father of transplantation . He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings . Famous zoologists such as Richard Dawkins referred to him as the wittiest of all scientific writers , and Stephen Jay Gould as the cleverest man I have ever known . Medawar was the younger son of a Lebanese father and a British mother , and was both Brazilian and British citizen by birth . He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College , Oxford and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London . Until he was partially disabled by a cerebral infarction , he was Director of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill . With his doctoral student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert E. Billingham , he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance ( the phenomenon of unresponsiveness of the immune system to certain molecules ) , which was theoretically predicted by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet . This became the foundation of tissue and organ transplantation . He and Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance .",

He established the field in a textbook which was updated in a number of editions . In particular , he studied metamorphosis . His most significant contribution was the discovery that neurosecretory cells in the brain of the South American kissing bug , Rhodnius prolixus , secrete a crucial hormone that triggers the prothoracic gland to release prothoracicotropic hormone ( PTTH ) , which regulates the process of metamorphosis . This was the first experimental confirmation of the function of neurosecretory cells . He went on to discover another hormone , called the juvenile hormone , which prevented the development of adult characteristics in R. prolixus until the insect had reached the appropriate larval stage . Wigglesworth was able to distort the developmental phases of the insect by controlling levels of this hormone . From these observations , Wigglesworth was able to develop a coherent theory of how an insect 's genome can selectively activate hormones which determine its development and morphology .",

Wilkins lived in a period of great political and religious controversy , yet managed to remain on working terms with men of all political stripes ; he was key in setting the Church of England on the path toward comprehension for as many sects as possible , and toleration for the rest .
