  "/wiki/5G": "5G is the fifth generation wireless technology for digital cellular networks that began wide deployment in 2019 . As with previous standards , the covered areas are divided into regions called cells , serviced by individual antennas . Virtually every major telecommunication service provider in the developed world is deploying antennas or intends to deploy them soon . The frequency spectrum of 5G is divided into millimeter waves , mid-band and low-band . Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor , 4G . 5G millimeter wave is the fastest , with actual speeds often being 1-2 Gbit/s down . Frequencies are above 24 GHz reaching up to 72 GHz which is above the extremely high frequency band 's lower boundary . The reach is short , so more cells are required . Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows , so indoor coverage is limited . 5G mid-band is the most widely deployed , in over 20 networks . Speeds in a 100 MHz wide band are usually 100-400 Mbit/s down . In the lab and occasionally in the field , speeds can go over a gigabit per second .",

  "/wiki/Tablet_computer": "A tablet computer , commonly shortened to tablet , is a mobile device , typically with a mobile operating system and touchscreen display processing circuitry , and a rechargeable battery in a single , thin and flat package . Tablets , being computers , do what other personal computers do , but lack some input/output ( I/O ) abilities that others have . Modern tablets largely resemble modern smartphones , the only differences being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones , with screens 7 inches ( 18 cm ) or larger , measured diagonally , and may not support access to a cellular network . The touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or digital pen ( stylus ) , instead of the mouse , trackpad , and keyboard of larger computers . Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and appearance of physical keyboards . Two species of tablet , the slate and booklet , do not have physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on their touchscreen displays . To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard , most tablets can connect to independent physical keyboards by Bluetooth or USB ; 2-in-1 PCs have keyboards , distinct from tablets . The form of the tablet was conceptualized in the middle of the 20th century ( Stanley Kubrick depicted fictional tablets in the 1968 science fiction film A Space Odyssey ) and prototyped and developed in the last two decades of that century . In 2010 , Apple released the iPad , the first mass-market tablet to achieve widespread popularity . Thereafter tablets rapidly rose in ubiquity and soon became a large product category used for personal , educational and workplace applications , with sales stabilizing in the mid-2010s .",

Ambient intelligence was a projection on the future of consumer electronics , telecommunications and computing that was originally developed in the late 1990s by Eli Zelkha and his team at Palo Alto Ventures for the time frame 2010-2020 . Ambient intelligence would allow devices to work in concert to support people in carrying out their everyday life activities , tasks and rituals in an intuitive way using information and intelligence that is hidden in the network connecting these devices ( for example : The Internet of Things ) . As these devices grew smaller , more connected and more integrated into our environment , the technological framework behind them would disappear into our surroundings until only the user interface remains perceivable by users .

  "/wiki/Artificial_intelligence": "In computer science , artificial intelligence ( AI ) , sometimes called machine intelligence , is intelligence demonstrated by machines , in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans . Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents : any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals . Colloquially , the term artificial intelligence is often used to describe machines ( or computers ) that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind , such as learning and problem solving . As machines become increasingly capable , tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of AI , a phenomenon known as the AI effect . A quip in Tesler 's Theorem says AI is whatever has n't been done yet . For instance , optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI , having become a routine technology . Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech , competing at the highest level in strategic game systems ( such as chess and Go ) , autonomously operating cars , intelligent routing in content delivery networks , and military simulations . Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955 , and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism , followed by disappointment and the loss of funding ( known as an AI winter ) , followed by new approaches , success and renewed funding . For most of its history , AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other . These sub-fields are based on technical considerations , such as particular goals ( e.g . robotics or machine learning ) , the use of particular tools ( logic or artificial neural networks ) , or deep philosophical differences . Subfields have also been based on social factors ( particular institutions or the work of particular researchers ) .",

  "/wiki/Augmented_reality": "Augmented reality ( AR ) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information , sometimes across multiple sensory modalities , including visual , auditory , haptic , somatosensory and olfactory . An augogram is a computer generated image that is used to create AR . Augography is the science and practice of making augograms for AR . AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features : a combination of real and virtual worlds , real-time interaction , and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects . The overlaid sensory information can be constructive ( i.e . additive to the natural environment ) , or destructive ( i.e . masking of the natural environment ) . This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment . In this way , augmented reality alters one 's ongoing perception of a real-world environment , whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user 's real-world environment with a simulated one . Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms : mixed reality and computer-mediated reality . The primary value of augmented reality is the manner in which components of the digital world blend into a person 's perception of the real world , not as a simple display of data , but through the integration of immersive sensations , which are perceived as natural parts of an environment . The earliest functional AR systems that provided immersive mixed reality experiences for users were invented in the early 1990s , starting with the Virtual Fixtures system developed at the U.S. Air Force 's Armstrong Laboratory in 1992 .",
  "/wiki/Blockchain_(database)": "A blockchain , originally block chain , is a growing list of records , called blocks , that are linked using cryptography . Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block , a timestamp , and transaction data ( generally represented as a Merkle tree ) . By design , a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data . It is an open , distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way . For use as a distributed ledger , a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks . Once recorded , the data in any given block can not be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks , which requires consensus of the network majority . Although blockchain records are not unalterable , blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance . Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain . Blockchain was invented by a person ( or group of people ) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin . The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown . The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server . The bitcoin design has inspired other applications , and blockchains that are readable by the public are widely used by cryptocurrencies .",

  "/wiki/Moore's_law": "Moore 's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years . The observation is named after Gordon Moore , the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and was the CEO of Intel , whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit , and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade . In 1975 , looking forward to the next decade , he revised the forecast to doubling every two years , a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 40% . The doubling period is often misquoted as 18 months because of a prediction by Moore 's colleague , Intel executive David House . In 1975 , House noted that Moore 's revised law of doubling transistor count every 2 years in turn implied that computer chip performance would roughly double every 18 months ( with no increase in power consumption ) . Moore 's law is closely related to MOSFET scaling , as the rapid scaling and miniaturization of metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistors ( MOSFETs , or MOS transistors ) is the key driving force behind Moore 's law . Moore 's prediction proved accurate for several decades and has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development ( R & D ) . Advancements in digital electronics are strongly linked to Moore 's law : quality-adjusted microprocessor prices , memory capacity ( RAM and flash ) , sensors , and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras . Digital electronics has contributed to world economic growth in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries .

  "/wiki/Heat-Assisted_Magnetic_Recording": "Heat-assisted magnetic recording ( HAMR ) is a magnetic storage technology for greatly increasing the amount of data that can be stored on a magnetic device such as a hard disk drive by temporarily heating the disk material during writing , which makes it much more receptive to magnetic effects and allows writing to much smaller regions ( and much higher levels of data on a disk ) . The technology was initially seen as extremely difficult to achieve , with doubts expressed about its feasibility in 2013 . The regions being written must be heated in a tiny area - small enough that diffraction prevents the use of normal laser focused heating - and requires a heating , writing and cooling cycle of less than 1 nanosecond , while also controlling the effects of repeated spot-heating on the drive platters , the drive-to-head contact , and the adjacent magnetic data which must not be affected . These challenges required the development of nano-scale surface plasmons ( surface guided laser ) instead of direct laser-based heating , new types of glass platters and heat-control coatings that tolerate rapid spot-heating without affecting the contact with the recording head or nearby data , new methods to mount the heating laser onto the drive head , and a wide range of other technical , development and control issues that needed to be overcome . In February 2019 , Seagate Technology announced that HAMR would be launched commercially in 2019 , having been extensively tested at partners during 2017 and 2018 .

  "/wiki/Shingled_Magnetic_Recording": "Shingled magnetic recording ( SMR ) is a magnetic storage data recording technology used in hard disk drives ( HDDs ) to increase storage density and overall per-drive storage capacity . Conventional hard disk drives record data by writing non-overlapping magnetic tracks parallel to each other ( perpendicular recording ) , while shingled recording writes new tracks that overlap part of the previously written magnetic track , leaving the previous track narrower and allowing for higher track density . Thus , the tracks partially overlap similar to roof shingles . This approach was selected because physical limitations prevent recording magnetic heads from having the same width as reading heads , leaving recording heads wider . :7-9 The overlapping-tracks architecture may slow down the writing process since writing to one track overwrites adjacent tracks , and requires them to be rewritten as well . Device-managed SMR devices hide this complexity by managing it in the firmware , presenting an interface like any other hard disk , while other SMR devices are host-managed and depend on the operating system to know how to handle the drive , and only write sequentially to certain regions of the drive . :11 ff . Seagate has been shipping device-managed SMR hard drives since September 2013 , while referring to an increase in overall hard disk drive capacity of about 25% , compared to non-shingled storage .

  "/wiki/Optical_disc": "In computing and optical disc recording technologies , an optical disc ( OD ) is a flat , usually circular disc which encodes binary data ( bits ) in the form of pits ( binary value of 0 or off , due to lack of reflection when read ) and lands ( binary value of 1 or on , due to a reflection when read ) on a special material ( often aluminium ) on one of its flat surfaces . The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate ( usually polycarbonate ) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer . The encoding pattern follows a continuous , spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track . The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine , and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more , depending on the drive type , disc format , and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc ( inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed ) . Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves . This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material , usually lacquer . The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label , sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself . Unlike the 3\u200b1\u20442-inch floppy disk , most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches , fingerprints , and other environmental problems . Optical discs are usually between 7.6 and 30 cm ( 3 to 12 in ) in diameter , with 12 cm ( 4.75 in ) being the most common size .

In addition , even a single GPU-CPU framework provides advantages that multiple CPUs on their own do not offer due to the specialization in each chip . Essentially , a GPGPU pipeline is a kind of parallel processing between one or more GPUs and CPUs that analyzes data as if it were in image or other graphic form . While GPUs operate at lower frequencies , they typically have many times the number of cores . Thus , GPUs can process far more pictures and graphical data per second than a traditional CPU . Migrating data into graphical form and then using the GPU to scan and analyze it can create a large speedup . GPGPU pipelines were developed at the beginning of the 21st century for graphics processing ( e.g. , for better shaders ) . These pipelines were found to fit scientific computing needs well , and have since been developed in this direction .",
  "/wiki/Parallel_computing": "Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously . Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones , which can then be solved at the same time . There are several different forms of parallel computing : bit-level , instruction-level , data , and task parallelism . Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing , but it 's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling . As power consumption ( and consequently heat generation ) by computers has become a concern in recent years , parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture , mainly in the form of multi-core processors . Parallel computing is closely related to concurrent computing - they are frequently used together , and often conflated , though the two are distinct : it is possible to have parallelism without concurrency ( such as bit-level parallelism ) , and concurrency without parallelism ( such as multitasking by time-sharing on a single-core CPU ) . In parallel computing , a computational task is typically broken down into several , often many , very similar sub-tasks that can be processed independently and whose results are combined afterwards , upon completion . In contrast , in concurrent computing , the various processes often do not address related tasks ; when they do , as is typical in distributed computing , the separate tasks may have a varied nature and often require some inter-process communication during execution . Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism , with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine , while clusters , MPPs , and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task . Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors , for accelerating specific tasks . In some cases parallelism is transparent to the programmer , such as in bit-level or instruction-level parallelism , but explicitly parallel algorithms , particularly those that use concurrency , are more difficult to write than sequential ones , because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs , of which race conditions are the most common . Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting optimal parallel program performance .",
  "/wiki/Exocortex": "A brain-computer interface ( BCI ) , sometimes called a neural-control interface ( NCI ) , mind-machine interface ( MMI ) , direct neural interface ( DNI ) , or brain-machine interface ( BMI ) , is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device . BCI differs from neuromodulation in that it allows for bidirectional information flow . BCIs are often directed at researching , mapping , assisting , augmenting , or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions . Research on BCIs began in the 1970s at the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) under a grant from the National Science Foundation , followed by a contract from DARPA . The papers published after this research also mark the first appearance of the expression brain-computer interface in scientific literature . Due to the cortical plasticity of the brain , signals from implanted prostheses can , after adaptation , be handled by the brain like natural sensor or effector channels . Following years of animal experimentation , the first neuroprosthetic devices implanted in humans appeared in the mid-1990s ."
