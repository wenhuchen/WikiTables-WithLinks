It consists of two major islands , Antigua and Barbuda , and a number of smaller islands ( including Great Bird , Green , Guiana , Long , Maiden and York Islands and further south , the island of Redonda ) . The permanent population numbers about 95,900 ( 2018 est . ) , with 97% being resident on Antigua . The capital and largest port and city is St. John 's on Antigua , with Codrington being the largest town on Barbuda . Lying near each other ( the main Barbuda airport is less than 0.5\u00b0 of latitude , or 56 kilometres ( 30 nautical miles ) , north of the main Antigua airport ) , Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the Leeward Islands , part of the Lesser Antilles , roughly at 17\u00b0N of the equator . The island of Antigua was explored by Christopher Columbus in 1493 and named for the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda La Antigua . Antigua was colonised by Britain in 1632 ; Barbuda island was first colonised in 1678 . Antigua and Barbuda joined the West Indies Federation in 1958 . With the breakup of the federation , it became one of the West Indies Associated States in 1967 .",

  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia": "The monarchy of Australia concerns the form of government in which a hereditary king or queen serves as the nation 's sovereign and head of state . Australia is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy , largely modelled on the Westminster system of parliamentary government , while incorporating features unique to the Constitution of Australia . The present monarch is Elizabeth II , styled Queen of Australia , who has reigned since 6 February 1952 . She is represented in Australia as a whole by the Governor-General , in accordance with the Australian Constitution and letters patent from the Queen , and in each of the Australian states , according to the state constitutions , by a governor , assisted by a lieutenant-governor . The monarch appoints the Governor-General and the governors , on the advice respectively of the Commonwealth government and each state government . These are now almost the only constitutional functions of the monarch with regard to Australia . Australian constitutional law provides that the monarch of the United Kingdom is also the monarch in Australia . This is understood today to constitute a separate Australian monarchy , the monarch acting with regard to Australian affairs exclusively upon the advice of Australian ministers . Australia is thus one of the Commonwealth realms , sixteen independent countries that share the same person as monarch and head of state . The future of the monarchy has been a recurring topic of public discussion .",
  "/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia_Constitution_Act_1900": "The Constitution of Australia , or Australian Constitution , is the supreme law under which the government of the Commonwealth of Australia operates , including its relationship to the States of Australia . It consists of several documents . The most important is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia , which is referred to as the Constitution in the remainder of this article . The Constitution was approved in a series of referendums held over 1898-1900 by the people of the Australian colonies , and the approved draft was enacted as a section of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 ( Imp ) , an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 ( Imp ) was given Royal Assent on 9 July 1900 , was proclaimed on 17 September 1900 , and entered into force on 1 January 1901 . Even though the Constitution was originally given legal force by an Act of the United Kingdom parliament , the Australia Act 1986 removed the power of the United Kingdom parliament to change the Constitution as in force in Australia , and the Constitution can now only be changed in accordance with the prescribed referendum procedures in Section 128 . Other pieces of legislation have constitutional significance for Australia . These are the Statute of Westminster , as adopted by the Commonwealth in the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 ( retroactive to 1939 ) , and the Australia Act 1986 , which was passed in equivalent forms by the United Kingdom Parliament and the Australian Federal Parliament ( using legislative powers conferred by enabling acts passed by the Parliaments of every Australian state ) . The Statute of Westminster Adoption Act is often regarded as the point at which Australia became de jure an independent nation , while the Australia Act for all practical purposes severed the remaining constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom . Although the monarch of the United Kingdom remains also the monarch of Australia , today this person , currently Queen Elizabeth II , acts in a distinct capacity as monarch of each . Authority to interpret the Constitution lies exclusively with federal courts : with the Federal Court of Australia and , finally , the High Court of Australia .",

The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on .

It first appeared in a Spanish map in 1511 . The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536 , but later abandoned it in 1620 ; with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited , and to replenish their water supply . An English ship , the Olive Blossom , arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625 ; its men took possession of it in the name of King James I . In 1627 , the first permanent settlers arrived from England , and it became an English and later British colony .

The island country lies east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands ( which belong to the Solomon Islands ) , southeast of Nauru , south of Kiribati , west of Tokelau , northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna , and north of Fiji . It is composed of three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 south and longitude of 176\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 , west of the International Date Line . Tuvalu has a population of 11,192 ( 2017 census ) . The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres ( 10 sq mi ) . The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians . The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago . During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes . The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls , with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia . In 1568 , Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to sail through the archipelago , sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis . The island of Funafuti was named Ellice 's Island in 1819 ; the name Ellice was applied to all of the nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay . The Ellice Islands came into Great Britain 's sphere of influence in the late 19th century , as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean .",

Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy , and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire . Latin has contributed many words to the English language . In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved . Latin was used as the language of international communication , scholarship and science until well into the 18th century , when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars ( including the Romance languages ) ."
