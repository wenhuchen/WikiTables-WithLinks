  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine": "Doctor of Medicine ( abbreviated M.D. , from the Latin Medicinae Doctor ) is a medical degree , the meaning of which varies between different jurisdictions . In the United States , Canada and some other countries , the M.D . denotes a professional graduate degree awarded upon graduation from medical school . In the United States , this generally arose because many in 18th century medical professions trained in Scotland , which used the M.D . degree nomenclature . In England , however , Bachelor of Medicine , Bachelor of Surgery was used and eventually in the 19th century became the standard in Scotland too . Thus , in the United Kingdom , Ireland and other countries , the M.D . is a research doctorate , higher doctorate , honorary doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree in medicine ; in those countries , the equivalent professional to the North American and some others use of M.D . is still typically titled Bachelor of Medicine , Bachelor of Surgery ( M.B.B.S . ) .",

  "/wiki/James_Watson": "James Dewey Watson ( born April 6 , 1928 ) is an American molecular biologist , geneticist and zoologist . In 1953 , he co-authored with Francis Crick the academic paper proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule . Watson , Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material . Watson earned degrees at the University of Chicago ( BS , 1947 ) and Indiana University ( PhD , 1950 ) . Following a post-doctoral year at the University of Copenhagen with Herman Kalckar and Ole Maal\u00f8e , Watson worked at the University of Cambridge 's Cavendish Laboratory in England , where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick . From 1956 to 1976 , Watson was on the faculty of the Harvard University Biology Department , promoting research in molecular biology . From 1968 he served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ( CSHL ) , greatly expanding its level of funding and research . At CSHL , he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer , along with making it a world leading research center in molecular biology . In 1994 , he started as president and served for 10 years . He was then appointed chancellor , serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming a genetic link between intelligence and race . Between 1988 and 1992 , Watson was associated with the National Institutes of Health , helping to establish the Human Genome Project . Watson has written many science books , including the textbook Molecular Biology of the Gene ( 1965 ) and his bestselling book The Double Helix ( 1968 ) .",
  "/wiki/George_Beadle": "George Wells Beadle ( October 22 , 1903 - June 9 , 1989 ) was an American geneticist . In 1958 he shared one-half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Edward Tatum for their discovery of the role of genes in regulating biochemical events within cells . He also served as the 7th President of the University of Chicago . Beadle and Tatum 's key experiments involved exposing the bread mold Neurospora crassa to x-rays , causing mutations . In a series of experiments , they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic pathways . These experiments led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions , known as the One gene-one enzyme hypothesis .",
  "/wiki/Edward_Tatum": "Edward Lawrie Tatum ( December 14 , 1909 - November 5 , 1975 ) was an American geneticist . He shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958 with George Beadle for showing that genes control individual steps in metabolism . The other half of that year 's award went to Joshua Lederberg . Beadle and Tatum 's key experiments involved exposing the bread mold Neurospora crassa to x-rays , causing mutations . In a series of experiments , they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic pathways . These experiments , published in 1941 , led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions , known as the one gene , one enzyme hypothesis . Tatum went on to study genetics in bacteria . An active area of research in his laboratory was to understand the basis of Tryptophan biosynthesis in Escherichia coli . Later , Tatum and his student Joshua Lederberg showed that E. coli could share genetic information through recombination . Tatum was born in Boulder , Colorado . He attended the college at the University of Chicago for two years , and transferred to the University of Wisconsin-Madison , where he received his BA in 1931 and PhD in 1934 . Starting in 1937 , he worked at Stanford University , where he began his collaboration with Beadle .",

  "/wiki/Alexis_Carrel": "Alexis Carrel ( French : [ al\u025bksi ka\u0281\u025bl ] ; 28 June 1873 - 5 November 1944 ) was a French surgeon and biologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1912 for pioneering vascular suturing techniques . He invented the first perfusion pump with Charles A. Lindbergh opening the way to organ transplantation . His positive description of an allegedly miraculous healing he witnessed during a pilgrimage earned him scorn of some of his colleagues . This prompted him to relocate to the United States , where he lived most of his life . He had a leading role in implementing eugenic policies in Vichy France . A Nobel Prize laureate in 1912 , Alexis Carrel was also elected twice , in 1924 and 1927 , as an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR ."
