  "/wiki/Ishi": "Ishi ( c. 1861 - March 25 , 1916 ) was the last known member of the Native American Yahi people from the present-day state of California in the United States . The rest of the Yahi ( as well as many members of their parent tribe , the Yana ) were killed in the California genocide in the 19th century . Ishi , who was widely acclaimed as the last wild Indian in America , lived most of his life isolated from modern American culture . In 1911 , aged 50 , he emerged near the foothills of Lassen Peak in Northern California . Ishi , which means man in the Yana language , is an adopted name . The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave him this name because in the Yahi culture , tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi . When asked his name , he said : I have none , because there were no people to name me , meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name on his behalf . Ishi was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California , Berkeley , who both studied him and hired him as a janitor . He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco . His life was depicted and discussed in multiple films and books , notably the biographical account Ishi in Two Worlds published by Theodora Kroeber in 1961 .",
