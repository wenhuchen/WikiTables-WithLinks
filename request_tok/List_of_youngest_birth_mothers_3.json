They speak the Khoekhoe language ( like the Nama people ) and the majority live in the northwestern regions of Namibia , however they are also found widely across the rest of the country . They have no known cultural relationship with any of the other ethnicities anywhere else in Africa , and very little is known of their origin . It has been proposed that the Damara are a remnant population of South-Western Africa hunter-gatherers , otherwise only represented by the Cimba , Kwisi , and Kwadi , who adopted the Khoekhoe language of the immigrant Nama people . However , recent genetic studies have found that Damara are closely related to neighbouring Himba and Herero people , consistent with an origin from Bantu speakers who shifted to a different language and culture . Their name in their own language is the Daman ( where the -n is just the Khoekhoe plural ending ) . The name Damaqua stems from the addition of the Khoekhoe suffix -qua/khwa meaning people ( found in the names of other Southern African peoples like the Namaqua and the Griqua ) . Prior to 1870 the hunter-gatherer Damaran occupied most of central Namibia they used to practice pastoralism with sheep and cattle , but were also agriculturalist planting pumpkins , corn , tobacco . The Damaran were also copper-smiths known for their ability to melt copper and used to make ornaments , jewellery , knives and spear heads out of iron . The Damaran just like the S\u0101n believed in communal ownership of land meaning that no individual owned land as God had given land to everyone . Thus , rather than one person owning good grazing land and another seeking out an existence , all would live in harmony . It was for this reason that many were displaced when the Nama and Herero began to occupy this area in search of better grazing .",

Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",

  "/wiki/Mental_age": "Mental age is a concept related to intelligence . It looks at how a specific individual ( usually a child ) , at a specific age , performs intellectually , compared to average intellectual performance for that individual 's actual chronological age ( i.e . time elapsed since birth ) . The intellectual performance is based on performance in tests and live assessments by a psychologist . The score achieved by the individual is compared to the median average scores at various ages , and the mental age ( x , say ) is derived such that the individual 's score equates to the average score at age x . However , mental age depends on what kind of intelligence is measured . For instance , a child 's intellectual age can be average for their actual age , but the same child 's emotional intelligence can be immature for their physical age . Psychologists often remark that girls are more emotionally mature than boys at around the age of puberty . Also , a six-year-old child intellectually gifted in Piaget [ clarification needed ] terms can remain a three-year-old child in terms of emotional maturity . Mental age was once considered a controversial concept .",

As of 2018 [ update ] , the country had a population of approximately 6.42 million . El Salvador was for centuries inhabited by several Mesoamerican nations , especially the Cuzcatlecs , as well as the Lenca and Maya . In the early 16th century , the Spanish Empire conquered the territory , incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City . However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little or no influence in the daily affairs of the Central American isthmus , which would be colonized in 1524 .

The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond .

When it affects the lower urinary tract it is known as a bladder infection ( cystitis ) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as a kidney infection ( pyelonephritis ) . Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include pain with urination , frequent urination , and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder . Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI . Rarely the urine may appear bloody . In the very old and the very young , symptoms may be vague or non-specific . The most common cause of infection is Escherichia coli , though other bacteria or fungi may sometimes be the cause . Risk factors include female anatomy , sexual intercourse , diabetes , obesity , and family history . Although sexual intercourse is a risk factor , UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) . Kidney infection , if it occurs , usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood-borne infection . Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone . In those with vague symptoms , diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection .",

  "/wiki/Thelarche": "Thelarche is the onset of secondary breast development , which often represents the beginning of pubertal development . The initial growth of breasts occurs during fetal development in both males and females . Thelarche is the stage at which male and female breasts become distinct due to variance in hormone levels ; however , some males have a condition in which they develop breasts , a term called gynecomastia . Thelarche , also known as breast budding , typically occurs between the ages of 8 and 13 years with significant variation between individuals . The cause of this variation is a question central to countless research projects , yet it is generally accepted that race , genetics , exercise , and body mass each influence the age of thelarche . Puberty is considered delayed if breast development does not start before age 13 or if a female has not had her first period ( menarche ) within 3 years of thelarche . Ordinarily , females experience menarche about 2 years after thelarche has begun . Complete breast development , from thelarche to adult breasts , takes between 2 and 4 years . If secondary breast development occurs before the age of 7 or 8 years , the individual may be experiencing either premature thelarche or precocious puberty . Pubertal changes , including breast development , are assessed using the Tanner Scale ( Sexual Maturity Rating Scale ) where stage 1 represents the lack of breast development , stage 2 is the breast budding or thelarche stage , stages 3 and 4 are continual breast growth and areolar development , and finally , stage 5 signifies completion of development . This system does not use breast size , but instead examines the shape of breasts , nipples , and areolae to determine the progression of growth . The growth and accumulation of adipose tissue in the breasts are induced by estrogen , while the development of mammary glands and areolae are caused by progesterone ; both estrogen and progesterone are produced by ovaries .",

The mean age of menarche has declined over the last century , but the magnitude of the decline and the factors responsible remain subjects of contention . The worldwide average age of menarche is very difficult to estimate accurately , and it varies significantly by geographical region , race , ethnicity and other characteristics .

Christopher Columbus thought he had reached the East Indies , but Portuguese Vasco da Gama had already reached India via the Indian Ocean route , when Brazil was discovered by Portugal . Nevertheless , the word \u00edndios ( Indians ) was by then established to designate the people of the New World and continues to be used in the Portuguese language to designate these people , while a person from India is called indiano in order to distinguish the two . At the time of European contact , some of the indigenous people were traditionally semi-nomadic tribes who subsisted on hunting , fishing , gathering and migrant agriculture . Many tribes suffered extinction as a consequence of the European settlement and many were assimilated into the Brazilian population .

  "/wiki/DNA_testing": "Genetic testing , also known as DNA testing , is used to identify changes in DNA sequence or chromosome structure . Genetic testing can also include measuring the results of genetic changes , such as RNA analysis as an output of gene expression , or through biochemical analysis to measure specific protein output . In a medical setting , genetic testing can be used to diagnose or rule out suspected genetic disorders , predict risks for specific conditions , or gain information that can be used to customize medical treatments based on an individual 's genetic makeup . Genetic testing can also be used to determine biological relatives , such as a child 's parentage ( genetic mother and father ) through DNA paternity testing , or be used to broadly predict an individual 's ancestry . Genetic testing of plants and animals can be used for similar reasons as in humans ( e.g . to assess relatedness/ancestry or predict/diagnose genetic disorders ) , to gain information used for selective breeding , or for efforts to boost genetic diversity in endangered populations . The variety of genetic tests has expanded throughout the years . Early forms of genetic testing which began in the 1950s involved counting the number of chromosomes per cell . Deviations from the expected number of chromosomes ( 46 in humans ) could lead to a diagnosis of certain genetic conditions such as trisomy 21 ( Down syndrome ) or monosomy X ( Turner syndrome ) . In the 1970s , a method to stain specific regions of chromosomes , called chromosome banding , was developed that allowed more detailed analysis of chromosome structure and diagnosis of genetic disorders that involved large structural rearrangements . In addition to analyzing whole chromosomes ( cytogenetics ) , genetic testing has expanded to include the fields of molecular genetics and genomics which can identify changes at the level of individual genes , parts of genes , or even single nucleotide letters of DNA sequence . According to the National Institutes of Health , there are tests available for more than 2,000 genetic conditions , and one study estimated that as of 2017 there were more than 75,000 genetic tests on the market .",

Situated in the western Pacific Ocean , it consists of about 7,641 islands that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south : Luzon , Visayas and Mindanao . The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City , both part of Metro Manila . Bounded by the South China Sea on the west , the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest , the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north , Japan to the northeast , Vietnam to the west , Palau to the east , and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south . The Philippines ' location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons , but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world 's greatest biodiversity . The Philippines is the world 's 5th largest island country with an area of 300,000 km2 ( 120,000 sq mi ) . As of 2015 , it had a population of at least 100 million . As of January 2018 [ update ] , it is the eighth-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world . Approximately 10 million additional Filipinos lived overseas , comprising one of the world 's largest diasporas . Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands . In prehistoric times , Negritos were some of the archipelago 's earliest inhabitants . They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples .",
