  "/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose . The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol . The presiding officer is the speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof ( and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party ) .",

  "/wiki/Plagiarism": "Plagiarism is the wrongful appropriation and stealing and publication of another author 's language , thoughts , ideas , or expressions [ citation needed ] and the representation of them as one 's own original work . Plagiarism is considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics . It is subject to sanctions such as penalties , suspension , expulsion from school or work , substantial fines and even incarceration . Recently , cases of extreme plagiarism have been identified in academia . The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe in the 18th century , particularly with the Romantic movement . Plagiarism is not in itself a crime , but like counterfeiting fraud can be punished in a court for prejudices caused by copyright infringement , violation of moral rights , or torts . In academia and industry , it is a serious ethical offense . Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent , but they are not equivalent concepts , and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement , which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts . Plagiarism might not be the same in all countries . Some countries like India and Poland consider plagiarism to be a crime , and there have been cases of people being imprisoned for plagiarizing . In other instances plagiarism might be the complete opposite of academic dishonesty , in fact some counties find the act of plagiarizing a professional 's work flattering . Students who move to the United States from countries where plagiarism is not frowned upon often find the transition difficult .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Senate": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

In addition to the Supreme Court of the United States , whose existence and some aspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to alter , Congress has established 13 courts of appeals ( also called circuit courts ) with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the United States , and 94 United States district courts . Every judge appointed to such a court may be categorized as a federal judge ; such positions include the chief justice and associate justices of the Supreme Court , circuit judges of the courts of appeals , and district judges of the United States district courts . All of these judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as Article III judges because they exercise the judicial power vested in the judicial branch of the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution . In addition , judges of the Court of International Trade exercise judicial power pursuant to Article III . Other judges serving in the federal courts , including magistrate judges and bankruptcy judges , are also sometimes referred to as federal judges ; however , they are neither appointed by the president nor confirmed by the Senate , and their power derives from Article I instead .",
