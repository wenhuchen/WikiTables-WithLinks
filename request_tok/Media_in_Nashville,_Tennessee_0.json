  "/wiki/Callsign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",

Some television stations chose to air infomercials as an alternative to the former practice of signing off . Some channels air infomercials 24 hours . Some stations also choose to air infomercials during the daytime hours mostly on weekends to fill in for unscheduled network or syndicated programming . By 2009 , most infomercial spending in the U.S. occurred during the early morning , daytime and evening hours , or in the afternoon . Stations in most countries around the world have instituted similar media structures . The infomercial industry is worth over $ 200 billion . While the term infomercial was originally applied only to television advertising , it is now sometimes used to refer to any presentation ( often on video ) which presents a significant amount of information in an actual , or perceived , attempt to promote a point of view . When used this way , the term may be meant to carry an implication that the party making the communication is exaggerating truths or hiding important facts .",
