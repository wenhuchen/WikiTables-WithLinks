  "/wiki/Digital_photography": "Digital photography uses cameras containing arrays of electronic photodetectors to capture images focused by a lens , as opposed to an exposure on photographic film . The captured images are digitized and stored as a computer file ready for further digital processing , viewing , electronic publishing , or digital printing . Until the advent of such technology , photographs were made by exposing light sensitive photographic film and paper , which was processed in liquid chemical solutions to develop and stabilize the image . Digital photographs are typically created solely by computer-based photoelectric and mechanical techniques , without wet bath chemical processing . The first consumer digital cameras were marketed in the late 1990s . Professionals gravitated to digital slowly , and were won over when their professional work required using digital files to fulfill the demands of employers and/or clients , for faster turn-around than conventional methods would allow . Starting around 2000 , digital cameras were incorporated in cell phones and in the following years , cell phone cameras became widespread , particularly due to their connectivity to social media websites and email . Since 2010 , the digital point-and-shoot and DSLR formats have also seen competition from the mirrorless digital camera format , which typically provides better image quality than the point-and-shoot or cell phone formats but comes in a smaller size and shape than the typical DSLR . Many mirrorless cameras accept interchangeable lenses and have advanced features through an electronic viewfinder , which replaces the through-the-lens finder image of the SLR format .",
  "/wiki/Poland": "Poland ( Polish : Polska [ \u02c8p\u0254lska ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Poland ( Polish : Rzeczpospolita Polska [ c ] [ \u0290\u025bt\u0361\u0282p\u0254\u02c8sp\u0254lita \u02c8p\u0254lska ] ( listen ) ) , is a country located in Central Europe . It is divided into 16 administrative subdivisions , covering an area of 312,696 square kilometres ( 120,733 sq mi ) , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate . With a population of nearly 38.5 million people , Poland is the fifth most populous member state of the European Union . Poland 's capital and largest metropolis is Warsaw . Other major cities include Krak\u00f3w , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , Wroc\u0142aw , Pozna\u0144 , Gda\u0144sk , and Szczecin . Poland is bordered by the Baltic Sea , Lithuania , and Russia 's Kaliningrad Oblast to the north , Belarus and Ukraine to the east , Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south , and Germany to the west . The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years . Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .",
  "/wiki/Electronics": "Electronics comprises the physics , engineering , technology and applications that deal with the emission , flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter . Electronics is widely used in information processing , telecommunication , and signal processing . The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible . Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards , electronics packaging technology , and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system , called an electronic system ; examples are computers or control systems . An electronic system may be a component of another engineered system or a standalone device . As of 2019 [ update ] most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control . The identification of the electron in 1897 , along with the invention of the vacuum tube , which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals , inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age . Commonly , electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements ; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit . Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes , transistors , diodes , integrated circuits , optoelectronics , and sensors , associated passive electrical components , and interconnection technologies . The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible . Electrical and electromechanical science and technology deals with the generation , distribution , switching , storage , and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms ( using wires , motors , generators , batteries , switches , relays , transformers , resistors , and other passive components ) . This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode , which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device .",

Germany is a very decentralised country . Its capital and largest metropolis is Berlin , while Frankfurt serves as its financial capital and has the country 's busiest airport . Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before AD 100 . Beginning in the 10th century , German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . During the 16th century , northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire , the German Confederation was formed in 1815 . The German revolutions of 1848-49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights .",
