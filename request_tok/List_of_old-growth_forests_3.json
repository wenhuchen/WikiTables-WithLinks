  "/wiki/British_Columbia": "British Columbia ( BC ; French : Colombie-Britannique ) is the westernmost province in Canada , located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains . With an estimated population of 5.1 million as of 2019 [ update ] , it is Canada 's third-most populous province . The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) . The capital of British Columbia is Victoria , the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada , named for Queen Victoria , who ruled during the creation of the original colonies . The largest city is Vancouver , the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada , the largest in Western Canada , and the second-largest in the Pacific Northwest .",
  "/wiki/Carmanah_Walbran_Provincial_Park": "Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park , originally Carmanah Pacific Provincial Park , is a remote wilderness park located inside traditional Ditidaht First Nation ( also spelled dii\u0241diitidq ) ancestral territory . The park covers a land area of 16,450 ha immediately adjacent to Pacific Rim National Park Reserve 's West Coast Trail on the southwestern , coastal terrain of Vancouver Island . The provincial park comprises the entire drainage of Carmanah Creek ( northwest of the mouth of the creek hosted the kwaabaaduw7aa7tx village , a local group whose alliance makes up one branch of the Ditidaht Nation ) , and a good portion of the lower Walbran River drainage , both of which independently empty into the Pacific Ocean . The park is named after the Anglicized diitiid ? aatx word kwaabaaduw7aa7tx , or Carmanah , meaning thus far upstream and John Thomas Walbran , a colonial explorer and ship 's captain . Access to the park is by gravel logging road from Port Alberni , Lake Cowichan , or Port Renfrew . The Carmanah Walbran protects extensive tracts of luxuriant Pacific temperate rainforest , and is famous for its ancient old growth , which includes giant western redcedar , coast Douglas-fir , western hemlock , and towering groves of Sitka spruce that grow along the productive riverside flats . Some of the western redcedar in the area are well over 1,000 years old , and Canada 's tallest tree , a Sitka spruce named the Carmanah Giant , measured at 95.836 m ( 314 ft ) , estimated to be around 400 years old , lives along the lower reaches of Carmanah Creek . However , trails to the Carmanah Giant and many other portions of the park are currently inaccessible due to the neglect and disrepair of the park 's boardwalk trail system - trail access via the boardwalk is essential in preserving the area 's delicate ecosystem . Although BC Parks received a funding increase in 2012 for the first time in over ten years , BC 's provincial government has repeatedly cut funding to the BC Parks ' budget , the result of which is BC Parks ' inability to staff a sufficient number of Park Rangers to maintain the network of trails and keep the park safe from cedar poachers and illegal logging . Hiking trails were initially developed in the area by Randy Stoltmann and members of the Western Canada Wilderness Committee ( what the Wilderness Committee was referred to at the time ) in the late 1980s . The trails were built before the Carmanah Valley was protected in an effort to draw attention to the spectacular old-growth forest and the precarity of its existence in the face of Vancouver-based logging company , MacMillan Bloedel ( now subsumed by Washington-based logging company Weyerhauser ) .",
  "/wiki/Central_Pacific_coastal_forests": "The Coast Range ecoregion is a Level III ecoregion designated by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) in the U.S. states of Washington , Oregon , and California . It stretches along the Pacific Coast from the tip of the Olympic Peninsula in the north to the San Francisco Bay in the south , including Grays Harbor , Willapa Bay , and the Long Beach Peninsula in Washington , the entire length of the Oregon Coast , and the Northern California Coast . Named for the Coast Range mountains , it encompasses the lower elevations of the Olympic Mountains , the Oregon Coast Range , the Californian North Coast Ranges , and surrounding lowlands . The low mountains of the ecoregion are covered by highly productive , rain-drenched evergreen forests that are home to the three tallest conifer species in the world : Coast redwood , Coast Douglas-fir , and Sitka spruce . Historically , Sitka spruce forests dominated the fog-shrouded coast , while a mosaic of western redcedar , western hemlock , and seral Douglas-fir blanketed the inland areas . Today , Douglas-fir plantations are prevalent on the intensively logged and managed landscape . Lithology influences land management strategies ; slopes underlain by sedimentary rock are more susceptible to failure following clearcutting and road building than those underlain by volcanic rock . The Coast Range ecoregion has been subdivided into fifteen Level IV ecoregions .",
  "/wiki/Coniferous": "The Pinophyta , also known as Coniferophyta or Coniferae , or commonly as conifers , are a division of vascular land plants containing a single extant class , Pinopsida . They are gymnosperms , cone-bearing seed plants . All extant conifers are perennial woody plants with secondary growth . The great majority are trees , though a few are shrubs . Examples include cedars , Douglas firs , cypresses , firs , junipers , kauri , larches , pines , hemlocks , redwoods , spruces , and yews . As of 1998 , the division Pinophyta was estimated to contain eight families , 68 genera , and 629 living species . [ citation needed ] Although the total number of species is relatively small , conifers are ecologically important . They are the dominant plants over large areas of land , most notably the taiga of the Northern Hemisphere , but also in similar cool climates in mountains further south . Boreal conifers have many wintertime adaptations . The narrow conical shape of northern conifers , and their downward-drooping limbs , help them shed snow . Many of them seasonally alter their biochemistry to make them more resistant to freezing . While tropical rainforests have more biodiversity and turnover , the immense conifer forests of the world represent the largest terrestrial carbon sink .",
  "/wiki/Temperate_rainforest": "Temperate rainforests are coniferous or broadleaf forests that occur in the temperate zone and receive heavy rainfall . Temperate rain forests occur in oceanic moist regions around the world : the Pacific temperate rain forests of North American Pacific Northwest as well as the Appalachian temperate rainforest of the Eastern U.S. Sun Belt ; the Valdivian temperate rain forests of southwestern South America ; the rain forests of New Zealand , Tasmania and southeastern Australia ; northwest Europe ( small pockets in the British Isles , Iceland , and larger areas in southern Norway and northern Iberia ) ; southern Japan ; the Black Sea-Caspian Sea region from the southeasternmost coastal zone of the Bulgarian coast , through Turkey , to Georgia , and northern Iran . The moist conditions of temperate rain forests generally support an understory of mosses , ferns and some shrubs .

Its area of 55,284 square kilometres ( 21,345 sq mi ) includes Cape Breton Island and 3,800 other coastal islands . The peninsula that makes up Nova Scotia 's mainland is connected to the rest of North America by the Isthmus of Chignecto , on which the province 's land border with New Brunswick is located . The province borders the Bay of Fundy to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east , and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland by the Northumberland and Cabot straits , respectively . The land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous Mi\ua78ckmaq people for thousands of years . France 's first settlement in North America , Port-Royal , was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of Acadia for over a hundred years . The Fortress of Louisbourg was a key focus point in the struggle between the British and French for control of the area , changing hands numerous times in the until France relinquished its claims with the Treaty of Paris in 1763 . During the American Revolutionary War , thousands of Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia . In 1848 , Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve responsible government , and it federated in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada ( now Ontario and Quebec ) to form what is now the country of Canada .
