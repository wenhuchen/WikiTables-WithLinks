  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",

  "/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-2_Beaver": "The de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver is a single-engined high-wing propeller-driven short takeoff and landing ( STOL ) aircraft developed and manufactured by de Havilland Canada . It has been primarily operated as a bush plane and has been used for a wide variety of utility roles , such as cargo and passenger hauling , aerial application ( crop dusting and aerial topdressing ) , and civil aviation duties . Shortly after the end of the Second World War , de Havilland Canada made the decision to orient itself towards civilian operators . Based upon feedback from pilots , the company decided that the envisioned aircraft should have excellent STOL performance , all-metal construction , and accommodate many features sought by the operators of bush planes . On 16 August 1947 , the maiden flight of the aircraft , which had received the designation DHC-2 Beaver , took place . In April 1948 , the first production aircraft was delivered to the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests . A Royal New Zealand Air Force ( RNZAF ) Beaver played a supporting role in Sir Edmund Hillary 's famous 1958 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition to the South Pole . In addition to its use in civilian operations , the Beaver has been widely adopted by armed forces as a utility aircraft . The United States Army purchased several hundred aircraft ; nine DHC-2s are still in service with the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary ( Civil Air Patrol ) for search and rescue . By 1967 , in excess of 1,600 Beavers had been constructed prior to the closure of the original assembly line . Various aircraft have been remanufactured and upgraded . Additionally , various proposals have been mooted to return the Beaver to production .",
