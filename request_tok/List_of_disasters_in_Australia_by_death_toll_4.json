  "/wiki/Terrorism": "Terrorism is , in the broadest sense , the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes . It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants ( mostly civilians and neutral military personnel ) . The terms terrorist and terrorism originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland , the Basque Country and Palestine . The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington , D.C. in 2001 . There are different definitions of terrorism . Terrorism is a charged term . It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong . Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups . Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives . These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations , nationalist groups , religious groups , revolutionaries and ruling governments . Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states . When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states , it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it , making legality a largely grey-area issue .",

The responsibility for investigation was delegated to the Dutch Safety Board ( DSB ) and the Dutch-led joint investigation team ( JIT ) , who concluded that the airliner was downed by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine . According to the JIT , the Buk that was used originated from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Federation and had been transported from Russia on the day of the crash , fired from a field in a rebel-controlled area and returned to Russia afterwards . On the basis of the JIT 's conclusions , the governments of the Netherlands and Australia held Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation and were pursuing legal routes to formalise this as of May 2018 [ update ] .

It is bordered by five countries : Gabon to its west ; Cameroon to its northwest and the Central African Republic to its northeast ; the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southeast and the Angolan exclave of Cabinda to its south ; and the Atlantic Ocean to its southwest . The region was dominated by Bantu-speaking tribes at least 3,000 years ago , who built trade links leading into the Congo River basin . Congo was formerly part of the French colony of Equatorial Africa . The Republic of the Congo was established on 28 November 1958 but gained independence from France in 1960 . It was a Marxist-Leninist state from 1969 to 1992 , under the name People 's Republic of the Congo . The sovereign state has had multi-party elections since 1992 , although a democratically elected government was ousted in the 1997 Republic of the Congo Civil War , and President Denis Sassou Nguesso , who first came to power in 1979 , has ruled for 35 of the past 40 years . The Republic of the Congo has become the fourth-largest oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea , providing the country with a degree of prosperity despite political and economic instability in some areas and unequal distribution of oil revenue nationwide . Congo 's economy is heavily dependent on the oil sector , and economic growth has slowed considerably since the post-2015 drop in oil prices .",

Located at the heart of the Indochinese peninsula , Laos is bordered by Myanmar and China to the northwest , Vietnam to the east , Cambodia to the southeast and Thailand to the west and southwest . Present Laos traces historic and cultural identity to the kingdom of Lan Xang Hom Khao ( Kingdom of a Million Elephants Under the White Parasol ) , which existed from the mid-fourteenth century to early eighteenth century as one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia . Due to its central geographical location in Southeast Asia , the kingdom became a hub for overland trade , turned wealthy economically and culturally . After a period of internal conflict , Lan Xang broke off into three separate kingdoms - Luang Phrabang , Vientiane , and Champasak . In 1893 , the three territories came under French protectorate and were united to form what is now known as Laos . It briefly gained independence in 1945 after Japanese occupation , but was recolonised by France until it won autonomy in 1949 . Laos became independent in 1953 , with a constitutional monarchy under Sisavang Vong . A post-independence civil war began , which saw the communist resistance , supported by the Soviet Union and North Vietnam , fight against the monarchy that later came under influence of military regimes supported by the United States . After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 , the communist Pathet Lao movement came to power , ending the civil war and establishing a one-party state . Laos was then dependent on military and economic aid from the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991 . In 2018 , the country had the fourth highest GDP ( PPP ) per capita in Southeast Asia , after Singapore , Malaysia , and Thailand .",

The crew of the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft last communicated with air traffic control ( ATC ) around 38 minutes after takeoff when the flight was over the South China Sea . The aircraft was lost from ATC radar screens minutes later but was tracked by military radar for another hour , deviating westwards from its planned flight path , crossing the Malay Peninsula and Andaman Sea . It left radar range 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) northwest of Penang Island in northwestern Peninsular Malaysia . With all 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard presumed dead , the disappearance of Flight 370 was the deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777 and the deadliest in Malaysia Airlines ' history until it was surpassed in both regards by Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 , which was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine four months later . The combined loss caused significant financial problems for Malaysia Airlines , which was renationalised by the Malaysian government in December 2014 . The search for the missing airplane , which became the most costly in aviation history , focused initially on the South China and Andaman seas , before analysis of the aircraft 's automated communications with an Inmarsat satellite identified a possible crash site somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean . The lack of official information in the days immediately after the disappearance prompted fierce criticism from the Chinese public , particularly from relatives of the passengers ; most people on board Flight 370 were of Chinese origin . Several pieces of marine debris confirmed to be from the aircraft washed ashore in the western Indian Ocean during 2015 and 2016 .

Titanic received six warnings of sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg . Unable to turn quickly enough , the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard side and opened six of her sixteen compartments to the sea ( the forepeak , all three holds , and boiler rooms 5 and 6 ) . Titanic had been designed to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more , and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink . They used distress flares and radio ( wireless ) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats . In accordance with existing practice , Titanic 's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels , not to hold everyone on board simultaneously ; therefore , with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away , there was no safe refuge for many of the passengers and crew . Compounding this , poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full . As a result , when Titanic sank , over a thousand passengers and crew were still on board . Almost all those who jumped or fell into the water either drowned or died within minutes due to the effects of cold shock and incapacitation .

The Branch Davidians were led by David Koresh and were headquartered at Mount Carmel Center ranch in the community of Axtell , Texas , 13 miles ( 21 kilometers ) east-northeast of Waco . Suspecting the group of stockpiling illegal weapons , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms ( ATF ) obtained a search warrant for the compound and arrest warrants for Koresh and a select few of the group 's members . The incident began when the ATF attempted to raid the ranch . An intense gun battle erupted , resulting in the deaths of four government agents and six Branch Davidians . Upon the ATF 's failure to raid the compound , a siege lasting 51 days was initiated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) . Eventually , the FBI launched an assault and initiated a tear gas attack in an attempt to force the Branch Davidians out of the ranch . During the attack , a fire engulfed Mount Carmel Center . This resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians , including 20 children , two pregnant women and David Koresh . The events of the siege and attack are disputed by various sources . A particular controversy ensued over the origin of the fire ; an internal Justice Department investigation concluded in 2000 that incendiary tear gas canisters were used by the FBI , but maintained that sect members had started the fire . The events thirteen miles from Waco , and the law enforcement siege at Ruby Ridge less than twelve months earlier , have been cited by commentators as catalysts for the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols ."
