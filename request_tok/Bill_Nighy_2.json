  "/wiki/Sam_Gamgee": "Samwise Sam Gamgee /\u02c8s\u00e6m\u02ccwa\u026az \u02c8\u0261\u00e6m\u02ccd\u0292i\u02d0/ ( later known as Samwise Gardner ) is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium . The hobbit Samwise is the chief supporting character of The Lord of the Rings , in which he fills an archetypal role as the sidekick of the primary protagonist , Frodo Baggins . Sam is a member of the Fellowship of the Ring , which also includes Frodo , Merry , Pippin , Legolas , Gimli , Boromir , Aragorn , and Gandalf . At the beginning of the story , Sam is Frodo 's gardener , and is drawn into Frodo 's adventure by Gandalf while eavesdropping on a private conversation . Throughout the story , Sam is Frodo 's steadfast companion and servant , portrayed as both physically strong for his size and emotionally strong , often pushing Frodo through difficult parts of the journey , and at time carrying Frodo when he is too weak to go on . Sam serves as Ring-bearer for a short time when Frodo is captured ; his emotional strength is again demonstrated when he willingly gives the Ring up when Frodo is able to take it again , the only character besides Bilbo Baggins and Tom Bombadil known to resist its pull . Following the War of the Ring Sam returns to the Shire and his role as gardener , helping to replant the trees which had been destroyed during The Scouring of the Shire . He is elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive terms , and in his old age is one of the last denizens of Middle-earth to be permitted to enter The Undying Lands , an honour accorded to him as one of the Ring-bearers .",
