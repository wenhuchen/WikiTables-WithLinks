  "/wiki/Michael_Forbes_(farmer)": "Michael Forbes ( born circa 1952 ) is a farmer , part-time salmon fisherman and quarry worker from near Balmedie in Aberdeenshire , Scotland , who became known after his refusal to sell his land to billionaire Donald Trump , who was planning to build an extensive luxury golf course complex in the area with assistance from the governing SNP Alex Salmond . Forbes 's farm , which is said by Trump to be in a state of disrepair , has the words NO GOLF COURSE painted on a shed . He attracted media attention in the United States for standing up to Trump . Forbes has insisted that he will never sell his land to Trump despite being offered a payment of \u00a3450,000 in addition to a salary of \u00a350,000 per year for an unspecified job . The plans to build the golf complex were rejected in late November 2007 by Aberdeenshire Council but were later called in by the Scottish Government , who gave approval in November 2008 . He has been compared to the beachcomber character in the film Local Hero . In August 2011 , contractors hired by Trump fenced off a piece of land belonging to Forbes despite Forbes having the title deeds . The Trump Organization at one point threatened to try to use a compulsory purchase order to forcibly remove him and his family from their land . Trump claimed that Forbes ' property was a slum that would spoil the view from his new hotel . Forbes retorted that Trump can take his money and shove it up his arse . The Tripping Up Trump Campaign was formed to challenge the Trump organization on the issue . Hundreds of people bought small interests in Forbes ' property and became co-owners , with the intention of making it more difficult to transfer the title to the land .",
