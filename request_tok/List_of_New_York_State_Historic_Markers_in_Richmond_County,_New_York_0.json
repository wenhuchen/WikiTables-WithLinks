  "/wiki/French_Church": "The Catholic Church in France is part of the worldwide Catholic Church in communion with the Pope in Rome . Established in the 2nd century in unbroken communion with the bishop of Rome , it is sometimes called the eldest daughter of the church . The first written records of Christians in France date from the 2nd century when Irenaeus detailed the deaths of ninety-year-old bishop Saint Pothinus of Lugdunum ( Lyon ) and other martyrs of the 177 AD persecution in Lyon . In 496 Remigius baptized King Clovis I , who therefore converted from paganism to Catholicism . In 800 , Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire , forming the political and religious foundations of Christendom in Europe and establishing in earnest the French government 's long historical association with the Catholic Church . In reaction , the French Revolution ( 1789-1790 ) was followed by heavy persecution of the Catholic Church . Since the beginning of the 20th century , La\u00efcit\u00e9 , absolute neutrality of the state with respect to religious doctrine , is the official policy of the Republic of France . Estimates of the proportion of Catholics range between 41% and 88% of France 's population , with the higher figure including lapsed Catholics and Catholic atheists . The Catholic Church in France is organised into 98 dioceses , which in 2012 were served by 7,000 sub-75 priests . 80 to 90 priests are ordained every year , when the church would need eight times as many to compensate the number of priest deaths . Approximately 45,000 Catholic church buildings and chapels are spread out among 36,500 cities , towns , and villages in France , but a majority are no longer regularly used for mass . Notable churches of France include Notre Dame de Paris , Chartres Cathedral , Reims Cathedral , and Basilique du Sacre-Coeur , Eglise de la Madeleine , and Amiens Cathedral .",
  "/wiki/Old_Town,_Staten_Island": "Old Town is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Staten Island , located on its East Shore . Old Town was established in August 1661 as part of New Netherland , and was the first permanent European settlement on Staten Island . Originally described as Oude Dorpe ( old village in Dutch ) , much of its original territory makes up what is present-day South Beach , with parts of Midland Beach and Dongan Hills . The area was settled by a group of Dutch , Walloon ( from what is now southern Belgium and its borders with France ) and French Protestants ( Huguenots ) led by Walloon Pierre Billiou .",
  "/wiki/Pierre_Billiou": "Pierre Billiou ( c.1632 - c.1702 ) was a French Huguenot born in Flanders . He was a founder of Old Town in 1661 , one of the first permanent settlements on Staten Island , shortly before the Dutch colony of New Netherland became the British Province of New York . The Dutch Colonial home whose construction Billiou began in the 1660s , now known as the Billiou-Stillwell-Perine House , is landmarked as the oldest existing building on Staten Island and one of the oldest buildings in the United States .",
  "/wiki/Dutch_West_India_Company": "The Dutch West India Company ( Dutch : Geoctroyeerde Westindische Compagnie , Dutch pronunciation : [ \u0263\u0259\u0294\u0254ktro\u02d0\u02c8je\u02d0rd\u0259 \u028b\u025bst\u02c8\u026andis\u0259 k\u0254mp\u0251\u02c8\u0272i ] ; English : Chartered West India Company ) was a chartered company ( known as the WIC ) of Dutch merchants as well as foreign investors . Among its founders was Willem Usselincx ( 1567-1647 ) and Jess\u00e9 de Forest ( 1576-1624 ) . On 3 June 1621 , it was granted a charter for a trade monopoly in the Dutch West Indies by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over Dutch participation in the Atlantic slave trade , Brazil , the Caribbean , and North America . The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa ( between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope ) and the Americas , which included the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of New Guinea . The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition , particularly Spanish or Portuguese , between the various trading posts established by the merchants . The company became instrumental in the largely ephemeral Dutch colonization of the Americas ( including New Netherland ) in the seventeenth century . From 1624 to 1654 , in the context of the Dutch-Portuguese War , the WIC held Portuguese territory in northeast Brazil , but they were ousted from Dutch Brazil following fierce resistance . After several reversals , WIC reorganized and a new charter was granted in 1675 , largely on the strength in the Atlantic slave trade . This New version lasted for more than a century , until after the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War , during which it lost most of its assets .",
  "/wiki/Church_of_England": "The Church of England ( C of E ) is the established church of England . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",
