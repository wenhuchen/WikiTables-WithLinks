Wise was the president of the Directors Guild of America from 1971 to 1975 and the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1985 through 1988 . Robert Wise has been viewed as a craftsman , inclined to let the ( sometimes studio-assigned ) story concept set the style . Later cineastes , such as Martin Scorsese , insist that despite Wise 's legendary workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget , his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan . Wise achieved critical success as a director in a striking variety of film genres : horror , noir , western , war , science fiction , musical and drama , with many repeat successes within each genre . Wise 's meticulous preparation may have been largely motivated by studio budget constraints , but advanced the moviemaking art . Robert Wise received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998 .",
