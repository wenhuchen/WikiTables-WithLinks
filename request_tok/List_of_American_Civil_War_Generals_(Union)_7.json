Hackleman was born in Franklin County , in 1814 . He married Sarah Bradburn in 1833 and began his life as a farmer . He studied law and eventually passed the bar and began practicing law . From 1837-1841 he served as probate judge of Rush County , Indiana . In 1840 he became editor of the Rushville Republican until the war . In 1841 he was elected to the Indiana State Legislature and served as a delegate to the National Republican Convention in Chicago which elected Abraham Lincoln as the Republican presidential candidate . On May 20 , 1861 , when the Civil War began , Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed Hackleman colonel of the 16th Indiana Volunteer Infantry of one-year volunteers . Hackleman and the 16th Indiana were sent to the Eastern Theater where they were engaged at the Battle of Ball 's Bluff . On April 28 , 1862 he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers and ordered to report to Ulysses S. Grant in the Western Theater . Hackleman was assigned to command the 1st Brigade in the 2nd Division of the Army of the Tennessee . The 2nd Division , led by Thomas A. Davies , was temporarily attached to William S.

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Corinth_I": "The siege of Corinth ( also known as the first Battle of Corinth ) was an American Civil War engagement lasting from April 29 to May 30 , 1862 , in Corinth , Mississippi . A collection of Union forces under the overall command of Major General Henry Halleck engaged in a month-long siege of the city , whose Confederate occupants were commanded by General P.G.T . Beauregard . The siege resulted in the capture of the town by Federal forces . The town was a strategic point at the junction of two vital railroad lines , the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and the Memphis and Charleston Railroad . Former Confederate Secretary of War LeRoy Pope Walker called this intersection the vertebrae of the Confederacy . General Halleck argued : Richmond and Corinth are now the great strategic points of the war , and our success at these points should be insured at all hazards . Another reason for the town 's importance was that , if captured by Union forces , it would threaten the security of Chattanooga and render Southern control of the track west of that East Tennessee bastion meaningless . The siege ended when the outnumbered Confederates withdrew on May 29 . This effectively cut off the prospect of further Confederate attempts to regain western Tennessee . The Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant took control and made it the base for Grant 's operations to seize control of the Mississippi River Valley , and especially the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg , Mississippi . Grant later within his memoirs would recall the importance Corinth held in the cause to a Union victory in the region : Corinth was a valuable strategic point for the enemy to hold , and consequently a valuable one for us to possess ourselves of .",

A noted expert in military studies , he was known by a nickname that became derogatory : Old Brains . He was an important participant in the admission of California as a state and became a successful lawyer and land developer . Halleck served as General-in-Chief of all Union armies during the American Civil War . Early in the Civil War , Halleck was a senior Union Army commander in the Western Theater . He commanded operations in the Western Theater from 1861 until 1862 , during which time , while the Union armies in the east were defeated and held back , the troops under Halleck 's command won many important victories . However , Halleck was not present at the battles , and his subordinates earned most of the recognition . The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the Siege of Corinth in the spring of 1862 , a Union victory which he conducted with extreme caution . Halleck also developed rivalries with many of his subordinate generals , such as Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell . In July 1862 , following Major General George B. McClellan 's failed Peninsula Campaign in the Eastern Theater , Halleck was promoted to general-in-chief of all U.S. armies . Halleck served in this capacity for about a year and a half . Halleck was a cautious general who believed strongly in thorough preparations for battle and in the value of defensive fortifications over quick , aggressive action .",

During the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , the title was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army . In 1783 , the title was simplified to Senior Officer of the United States Army . In 1821 , the title was changed to Commanding General of the United States Army . The office was often referred to by various other titles , such as Major General Commanding the Army or General-in-Chief . From 1789 until its abolition in 1903 , the position of Commanding General was legally subordinate to the Secretary of War . The position was abolished with the creation of the statutory Chief of Staff of the Army in 1903 .",

In general , a chief of staff provides a buffer between a chief executive and that executive 's direct-reporting team . The chief of staff generally works behind the scenes to solve problems , mediate disputes , and deal with issues before they are brought to the chief executive .

  "/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States": "The Reconstruction era was the period in American history which lasted from 1863 to 1877 . It was a significant chapter in the history of American civil rights . The term has two applications : the first applies to the complete history of the entire country from 1865 to 1877 following the American Civil War ; the second , to the attempted transformation of the 11 former Confederate states from 1863 to 1877 , as directed by Congress , and the role of the Union states in that transformation . Reconstruction ended the remnants of Confederate secession and abolished slavery , making the newly freed slaves citizens with civil rights ostensibly guaranteed by three new constitutional amendments . Three visions of Civil War memory appeared during Reconstruction : the reconciliationist vision , which was rooted in coping with the death and devastation the war had brought ; the white supremacist vision , which included segregation and the preservation of the traditional cultural standards of the South ; and the emancipationist vision , which sought full freedom , citizenship , and constitutional equality for African Americans . When President Abraham Lincoln , a Republican , was assassinated at the end of the Civil War , Vice President Andrew Johnson , a Democrat from Tennessee and former slave holder , became president . Johnson favored rapid measures to bring the South back into the Union , allowing the Southern states to determine the rights of former slaves . Radical Republicans in Congress sought stronger , federal measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans , including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , while curtailing the rights of former Confederates , such as through the provisions of the Wade-Davis Bill . Johnson , the most prominent Southerner to oppose the Confederacy , followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates . Lincoln 's last speeches show that he was leaning toward supporting the suffrage of all freedmen , whereas Johnson and the Democratic Party were strongly opposed to this . Johnson 's weak Reconstruction policies prevailed until the congressional elections of 1866 . Those elections followed outbreaks of violence against blacks in the former rebel states , including the Memphis riots of 1866 and the New Orleans massacre of 1866 .",

After two months and 70 miles ( 110 km ) of such maneuvering , Sherman 's path was blocked by imposing fortifications on Kennesaw Mountain , near Marietta , Georgia , and the Union general chose to change his tactics and ordered a large-scale frontal assault on June 27 , 1864 . Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson feinted against the northern end of Kennesaw Mountain , while his corps under Maj. Gen. John A. Logan assaulted Pigeon Hill on its southwest corner .
