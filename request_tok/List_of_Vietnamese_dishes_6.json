  "/wiki/Durian": "The durian ( /\u02c8dj\u028a\u0259ri\u0259n , \u02c8d\u028ar- , -\u00e6n/ ) is the fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio . There are 30 recognised Durio species , at least nine of which produce edible fruit , with over 300 named varieties in Indonesia , 100 in Thailand and 100 in Malaysia . Durio zibethinus is the only species available in the international market : other species are sold in their local regions . It is native to Borneo and Sumatra . Named in some regions as the king of fruits , the durian is distinctive for its large size , strong odour , and thorn-covered rind . The fruit can grow as large as 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) long and 15 centimetres ( 6 in ) in diameter , and it typically weighs one to three kilograms ( 2 to 7 lb ) . Its shape ranges from oblong to round , the colour of its husk green to brown , and its flesh pale yellow to red , depending on the species . Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance , whereas others find the aroma overpowering with an unpleasant odour . The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust , and has been described variously as rotten onions , turpentine , and raw sewage . The persistence of its odour , which may linger for several days , has led to the fruit 's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in southeast Asia . By contrast , the nineteenth-century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described its flesh as a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds . The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness , and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet desserts in southeast Asian cuisines .",

The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures . The fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid , which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor . Cow 's milk is commonly available worldwide and , as such , is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt . Milk from water buffalo , goats , ewes , mares , camels , and yaks is also used to produce yogurt where available locally . The milk used may be homogenized or not , even pasteurized or raw . Each type of milk produces substantially different results . Yogurt is produced using a culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp . bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria . In addition , other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt . Some countries require yogurt to contain a certain amount of colony-forming units ( CFU ) of bacteria ; in China , for example , the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 million CFU per milliliter . To produce yogurt , milk is first heated , usually to about 85 \u00b0C ( 185 \u00b0F ) , to denature the milk proteins so that they do not form curds .",
