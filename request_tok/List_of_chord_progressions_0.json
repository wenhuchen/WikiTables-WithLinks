  "/wiki/50s_progression": "The '50s progression is a chord progression and turnaround used in Western popular music . The progression , represented in Roman numeral analysis , is : I-vi-IV-V. For example , in C major : C-Am-F-G. As the name implies , it was common in the 1950s and early 1960s and is particularly associated with doo-wop . It has also been called the Heart and Soul chords , the Stand by Me changes , the doo-wop progression:204 and the ice cream changes . The first song to use the sequence extensively might have been Blue Moon , written in 1933 by Richard Rodgers , and first released , with lyrics by Lorenz Hart , in 1934 . [ not verified in body ]",

  "/wiki/Andalusian_cadence": "The Andalusian cadence ( diatonic phrygian tetrachord ) is a term adopted from flamenco music for a chord progression comprising four chords descending stepwise - a vi-V-IV-III progression with respect to the major mode or i-VII-VI-V progression with respect to the minor mode . It is otherwise known as the minor descending tetrachord . Traceable back to the Renaissance , its effective sonorities made it one of the most popular progressions in classical music Play ( help\u00b7info ) . Despite the name it is not a true cadence ( i.e. , occurring only once , when ending a phrase , section , or piece of music ) ; it is most often used as an ostinato ( repeating over and over again ) . It is heard in rock songs such as Runaway by Del Shannon .",

  "/wiki/Backdoor_progression": "In jazz and jazz harmony , the chord progression from iv7 to \u266dVII7 to I ( the tonic or home key ) has been nicknamed the backdoor progression or the backdoor ii-V , as described by jazz theorist and author Jerry Coker . This name derives from an assumption that the normal progression to the tonic , the ii-V-I turnaround ( ii-V7 to I , see also authentic cadence ) is , by inference , the front door , a metaphor suggesting that this is the main route to the tonic . The \u266dVII7 chord , a pivot chord borrowed from the parallel minor of the current tonic major key , is a dominant seventh . Therefore , it can resolve to I ; it is commonly preceded by IV going to iv , then \u266dVII7 , then I . In C major the dominant would be G7 : ( the notes GBDF ) , sharing two common tones with B\u266d7 : ( the notes B\u266dDFA\u266d ) . The notes A\u266d and F serve as upper leading-tones back to G and E ( when the chord moves to the tonic , C major ) , respectively , rather than B\u266e and F serving as the lower and upper leading-tones to C and E in a conventional G7-C major ( V7-I ) cadence .",

Coltrane continued his explorations on the 1960 album Giant Steps and expanded on the substitution cycle in his compositions Giant Steps and Countdown , the latter of which is a reharmonized version of Eddie Vinson 's Tune Up .

  "/wiki/Eight-bar_blues": "In music , an eight-bar blues is a typical blues chord progression , the second most common blues form , common to folk , rock , and jazz forms of the blues , taking eight 44 or 128 bars to the verse .

Heartbreak Hotel , How Long Blues , Ai n't Nobody 's Business , Cherry Red , It Hurts Me Too , Worried Life Blues , and Get a Haircut are all eight-bar blues standards . [ citation needed ] One variant using this progression is to couple one eight-bar blues melody with a different eight-bar blues bridge to create a blues variant of the standard 32-bar song . Walking By Myself , I Want a Little Girl and ( Romancing ) In The Dark are examples of this form . [ citation needed ] See also blues ballad . Eight bar blues progressions have more variations than the more rigidly defined twelve bar format . The move to the IV chord usually happens at bar 3 ( as opposed to 5 in twelve bar ) ; however , the I chord moving to the V chord right away , in the second measure , is a characteristic of the eight-bar blues . In the following examples each box represents a 'bar ' of music ( the specific time signature is not relevant ) . The chord in the box is played for the full bar . If two chords are in the box they are each played for half a bar , etc . The chords are represented as scale degrees in Roman numeral analysis .",

It is a succession of chords whose roots descend in fifths from the second degree ( supertonic ) to the fifth degree ( dominant ) , and finally to the tonic . In a major key , the supertonic triad ( \u2171 ) is minor , and in a minor key it is diminished . The dominant is , in its normal form , a major triad and commonly a dominant seventh chord . With the addition of chord alterations , substitutions , and extensions , limitless variations exist on this simple formula . The \u2171-\u2164-I progression is a staple of virtually every type of [ Western ] popular music , including jazz , R & B , pop , rock , and country .

Neither the date nor the circumstances of its composition are known ( suggested dates range from 1680 to 1706 ) , and the oldest surviving manuscript copy of the piece dates from the 19th century . Pachelbel 's Canon , like his other works , although popular during his lifetime , went out of style , and remained in obscurity for centuries . A 1968 arrangement and recording of it by the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paillard chamber orchestra gained popularity over the next decade , and in the 1970s the piece began to be recorded by many ensembles ; by the early 1980s its presence as background music was deemed inescapable . From the 1970s to the late 2010s , elements of the piece , especially its chord progression , were used in a variety of pop songs . Since the 1980s , it has also been used frequently in weddings and funeral ceremonies in the Western world . The canon was originally scored for three violins and basso continuo and paired with a gigue . Both movements are in the key of D major . Although a true canon at the unison in three parts , it also has elements of a chaconne .",
