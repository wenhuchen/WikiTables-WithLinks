Ronnie O'Sullivan won his third Masters title by defeating Ding Junhui 10-3 in the final . With a noticeably partisan crowd , a visibly upset Ding went to shake O'Sullivan 's hand after the latter won the 12th frame to go 9-3 in front , apparently believing that the match was over . The two walked arm-in-arm out of the arena . After O'Sullivan clinched the match in the following frame , it later transpired that Ding had indeed believed the match was best-of-17 frames .",

Lee was a strong break-builder compiling 184 competitive century breaks during his career , and his smooth cue action is regarded by some pundits as the most natural the game has seen .
