The city is located geographically within Simcoe County , however , it is a politically independent single-tier municipality . It is part of the historically significant Huronia region of Central Ontario and is within the northern part of the Greater Golden Horseshoe , a densely populated and industrialized region of Ontario . As of the 2016 census , the city 's population was 141,434 making it the 34th largest in Canada in terms of population proper . The Barrie census metropolitan area ( CMA ) as of the same census had a population of 197,059 residents , making the city the 21st largest CMA in Canada . The city itself has seen significant growth in recent decades due to its emergence as a bedroom community , and its relatively close proximity to the city of Toronto . Barrie is situated approximately 86.6 kilometres ( 53.8 mi ) from the Toronto Pearson International Airport and 109 kilometres ( 68 mi ) from Downtown Toronto , representing the city 's highly centralized and historically strategic geographical orientation and its ease of access to major centres and airports across the region . The Barrie area was first settled during the War of 1812 as a key supply depot for British forces . It would be named twenty years later for Sir Robert Barrie , who consistently commanded forces through the region . Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , Barrie 's emergence as a bedroom community for the city of Toronto grew in prominence , and its economy would be wrapped around the education , healthcare , information technology and service sectors . Being located in the climatically deterrent snowbelt region of southern Ontario , Barrie is notorious for its deluging snow squalls in the winter . In the summer , its position within a convergence of breezes originating from the surrounding Great Lakes can provoke intense thunderstorms .",

The main body of the bay lies east of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island . To its northwest is the North Channel . Georgian Bay is surrounded by ( listed clockwise ) the districts of Manitoulin , Sudbury , Parry Sound and Muskoka , as well as the more populous counties of Simcoe , Grey and Bruce . The Main Channel separates the Bruce Peninsula from Manitoulin Island and connects Georgian Bay to the rest of Lake Huron . The North Channel , located between Manitoulin Island and the Sudbury District , west of Killarney , was once a popular route for steamships and is now used by a variety of pleasure craft to travel to and from Georgian Bay . The shores and waterways of the Georgian Bay are the traditional domain of the Anishinaabeg First Nations peoples to the north and Huron-Petun ( Wyandot ) to the south . The bay was thus a major Algonquian-Iroquoian trade route . Samuel de Champlain , the first European to explore and map the area in 1615-1616 , called it La Mer douce ( the calm sea ) , which was a reference to the bay 's freshwater . In 1822 , after Great Britain had taken over the territory , Lieutenant Henry Wolsey Bayfield of a Royal Navy expedition named it as Georgian Bay ( after King George IV ) .",

His stand-in during this time was Isaac Brock , who sought an active role in the impending war as keenly as Gore sought to escape it . Gore resumed his role as lieutenant-governor from 1815 to 1817 . During his second term , Gore prorogued the Legislative Assembly after it challenged his ban on issuing land grants to American refugees and made other criticisms of his administration . Robert MacIntosh , in his book Earliest Toronto , describes Gore as a man who was clearly the most incompetent and disliked Lieutenant Governor in the history of Upper Canada .

  "/wiki/Thayendanegea": "Thayendanegea or Joseph Brant ( March 1743 - November 24 , 1807 ) was a Mohawk military and political leader , based in present-day New York , who was closely associated with Great Britain during and after the American Revolution . Perhaps the Native American of his generation best known to the Americans and British , he met many of the most significant Anglo-American people of the age , including both George Washington and King George III . While not born into a hereditary leadership role within the Iroquois League , Brant rose to prominence due to his education , abilities and his connections to British officials . His sister , Molly Brant , was the consort of Sir William Johnson , the influential British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the province of New York . During the American Revolutionary War , Brant led Mohawk and colonial Loyalists known as Brant 's Volunteers against the rebels in a bitter partisan war on the New York frontier . He was accused by the Americans of committing atrocities and given the name Monster Brant , but the accusations were argued by later historians to have been false . In 1784 , Frederick Haldimand granted Joseph Brant and his followers a land treaty to replace what they had lost in New York State at the Sandusky Council after the Revolution . This tract , the Haldimand Grant , was about 810,000 hectares ( 2,000,000 acres ) in size , covering the Grand River area in what is now southwestern Ontario from the source to the mouth of the river and 9.6 kilometres ( 6 miles ) deep on each side .

The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) with the assistance of France , winning independence from Great Britain and establishing the United States of America . The American colonials proclaimed no taxation without representation starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 . They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they had no representatives in that governing body . Protests steadily escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772 , followed by the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 . The British responded by closing Boston Harbor and enacting a series of punitive laws which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony 's rights of self-government . The other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts , and a group of American Patriot leaders set up their own government in late 1774 at the Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance of Britain ; other colonists retained their allegiance to the Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories . Tensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when King George 's forces attempted to destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 . The conflict then developed into war , during which the Patriots ( and later their French allies ) fought the British and Loyalists in the Revolutionary War . Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress which assumed power from the former colonial governments , suppressed Loyalism , and recruited a Continental Army led by General George Washington . The Continental Congress declared King George a tyrant who trampled the colonists ' rights as Englishmen , and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2 , 1776 . The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy , and they proclaimed that all men are created equal .",

Upper Canada included all of modern-day Southern Ontario and all those areas of Northern Ontario in the Pays d'en Haut which had formed part of New France , essentially the watersheds of the Ottawa River or Lakes Huron and Superior , excluding any lands within the watershed of Hudson Bay . The upper prefix in the name reflects its geographic position along the Great Lakes , mostly above the headwaters of the Saint Lawrence River , contrasted with Lower Canada ( present-day Quebec ) to the northeast . It was the primary destination of Loyalist refugees and settlers from the United States after the American Revolution , who often were granted land to settle in Upper Canada . The province was characterized by its British way of life , including bicameral parliament and separate civil and criminal law , rather than mixed as in Lower Canada or elsewhere in the British Empire . The division was created to ensure the exercise of the same rights and privileges enjoyed by loyal subjects elsewhere in the North American colonies . In 1812 , war broke out between Great Britain and the United States , leading to several battles in Upper Canada . The US had hoped to capture Upper Canada , but the war ended with the situation unchanged . The government of the colony came to be dominated by a small group of persons , known as the Family Compact , who held most of the top positions in the Legislative Council and appointed officials .

It is administratively a Unitary authority , and thus not part of any district , county , or regional municipality . The Sudbury region was inhabited by the Ojibwe people of the Algonquin group for thousands of years prior to the founding of Sudbury following the discovery of nickel ore in 1883 during the construction of the transcontinental railway . Greater Sudbury was formed in 2001 by merging the cities and towns of the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury with several previously unincorporated townships .

The population resides in an urban core and many smaller communities scattered around 330 lakes and among hills of rock blackened by historical smelting activity . Sudbury was once a major lumber centre and a world leader in nickel mining . Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century . The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco , now Vale Limited , which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s , and Falconbridge , now Glencore .

Its textile industries prospered during the Late Middle Ages ; the wealth of which funded many of its buildings and churches . The town became notable for its art in the 18th century , being the birthplace of Thomas Gainsborough , whose landscapes offered inspiration to John Constable , another Suffolk painter of the surrounding Stour Valley area . The 19th century saw the arrival of the railway with the opening of a station on the historic Stour Valley Railway , and Sudbury railway station forms the current terminus of the Gainsborough Line .

Known as The Royal City , Guelph is roughly 28 km ( 17 mi ) east of Kitchener and 100 km ( 62 mi ) west of Downtown Toronto , at the intersection of Highway 6 , Highway 7 and Wellington County Road 124 . It is the seat of Wellington County , but is politically independent of it . The city is built on the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation . Guelph began as a settlement in the 1820s , established by Scotsman John Galt , who was in Upper Canada as the first Superintendent of the Canada Company . He based the headquarters , and his home , in the community . The area - much of which became Wellington County - had been part of the Halton Block , a Crown Reserve for the Six Nations Iroquois . Galt would later be considered as the founder of Guelph . Because of its relatively low crime rates , clean environment and generally high standard of living , Guelph is consistently rated as one of Canada 's best places to live . For many years , Guelph ranked at or near the bottom of Canada 's crime severity list . However , the 2017 Crime Severity Index showed a 15% increase from 2016 . Guelph has been noted as having one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country throughout the Great Recession .",

It is the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population , with French as the sole provincial official language . Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City , the capital . Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area , including the Island of Montreal . English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais , Eastern Townships , and Gasp\u00e9 regions . The Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec region , occupying the northern half of the province , is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples . The climate around the major cities is four-seasons continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers , but farther north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions .",

The language is characterized by a series of dialects that have local names and frequently local writing systems . There is no single dialect that is considered the most prestigious or most prominent , and no standard writing system that covers all dialects . Dialects of Ojibwemowin are spoken in Canada , from southwestern Quebec , through Ontario , Manitoba and parts of Saskatchewan , with outlying communities in Alberta ; and in the United States , from Michigan to Wisconsin and Minnesota , with a number of communities in North Dakota and Montana , as well as groups that removed to Kansas and Oklahoma during the Indian Removal period .

Based upon contemporary field research , J. R. Valentine also recognizes several other dialects : Berens Ojibwe in northwestern Ontario , which he distinguishes from Northwestern Ojibwe ; North of ( Lake ) Superior ; and Nipissing .

The lakes are located on the boundary between the Paleozoic limestone regions of the Golden Horseshoe , and the Precambrian granite Canadian Shield of northern and central Ontario . Kawartha is an anglicization of the word Ka-wa-tha ( from Ka-wa-tae-gum-maug or Gaa-waategamaag ) , a word coined in 1895 by aboriginal Martha Whetung of the Curve Lake First Nations . It was hoped that the word , which meant land of reflections in the Anishinaabe language , would provide a convenient and popular advertising label for the area , much as Muskoka had come to describe the area and lakes north of Gravenhurst . The word was subsequently changed by tourism promoters to Kawartha , with the meaning bright waters and happy lands . Though the city of Kawartha Lakes is named for them , more than half of the Kawartha Lakes are in fact located in Peterborough County .

In linguistics , a portmanteau is a single morph that is analyzed as representing two ( or more ) underlying morphemes . The definition overlaps with the grammatical term contraction , but contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence , such as do and not to make do n't , whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept . A portmanteau also differs from a compound , which does not involve the truncation of parts of the stems of the blended words . For instance , starfish is a compound , not a portmanteau , of star and fish , as it includes both words in full .",
  "/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario": "Kingston is a city in Eastern Ontario , Canada .

The city is midway between Toronto , Ontario and Montreal , Quebec . The Thousand Islands tourist region is nearby to the east . Kingston is nicknamed the Limestone City because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone . Growing European exploration in the 17th century , and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade , led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as Cataraqui ( generally pronounced kah-tah-ROCK-way ) in 1673 . This outpost , called Fort Cataraqui , and later Fort Frontenac , became a focus for settlement . Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort , and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s . Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10 , 1841 . While its time as a capital city was short ( ending in 1844 ) , the community has remained an important military installation . Kingston was the county seat of Frontenac County until 1998 .

  "/wiki/Berlin_to_Kitchener_name_change": "The city of Kitchener , Ontario voted in May 1916 to change the name of the city from its original name , Berlin , primarily because of some anti-German sentiment during the First World War . Through the latter half of the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th , the city of Berlin , Ontario , Canada , was a bustling industrial centre celebrating its German heritage . However , when World War I started , that heritage became the focus of considerable enmity from non-German residents within the city and throughout Waterloo County . The First World War created conflict among the citizens of Waterloo County . Not only were residents divided by ethnicity - German and British - but longstanding civic rivalries between Berlin ( now Kitchener ) and Galt ( now Cambridge ) increased the tension . The vote passed by only a slim margin . By late June , the final shortlist of new names were : Adanac , Brock , Benton , Corona , Keowana and Kitchener . Kitchener was a late addition to the shortlist of possible names , as it was added shortly after the death of Horatio Herbert Kitchener , a prominent figure in the British Empire 's war effort , who had died June 5 , 1916 . While more than 15,000 people lived in the city at the time , 346 people voted for the name Kitchener on June 28 , 1916 , from approximately 5,000 eligible voters .

Its opposite is Germanophilia . The sentiment largely began with the mid-19th century unification of Germany , which made the new nation a rival to the Great Powers of Europe on economic , cultural , geopolitical and military grounds . In the 20th century , the role of Germans as the primary perpetrators of the Holocaust and Germany 's role in starting two world wars also fed anti-German sentiment amongst Germany 's enemy countries and the citizens of those countries .",
  "/wiki/First_World_War": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

Kitchener was credited in 1898 for winning the Battle of Omdurman and securing control of the Sudan for which he was made Baron Kitchener of Khartoum . As Chief of Staff ( 1900-1902 ) in the Second Boer War he played a key role in Lord Roberts ' conquest of the Boer Republics , then succeeded Roberts as commander-in-chief - by which time Boer forces had taken to guerrilla fighting and British forces imprisoned Boer civilians in internment camps . His term as Commander-in-Chief ( 1902-09 ) of the Army in India saw him quarrel with another eminent proconsul , the Viceroy Lord Curzon , who eventually resigned . Kitchener then returned to Egypt as British Agent and Consul-General ( de facto administrator ) . In 1914 , at the start of the First World War , Kitchener became Secretary of State for War , a Cabinet Minister . One of the few to foresee a long war , lasting for at least three years , and with the authority to act effectively on that perception , he organised the largest volunteer army that Britain had seen , and oversaw a significant expansion of materials production to fight on the Western Front . Despite having warned of the difficulty of provisioning for a long war , he was blamed for the shortage of shells in the spring of 1915 - one of the events leading to the formation of a coalition government - and stripped of his control over munitions and strategy . On 5 June 1916 , Kitchener was making his way to Russia on HMS Hampshire to attend negotiations with Tsar Nicholas II when the ship struck a German mine 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) west of Orkney , Scotland , and sank . Kitchener was among 737 who died ."
