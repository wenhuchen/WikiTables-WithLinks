The road races took place over a course starting and ending in The Mall in central London and heading out into Surrey , while the time trials started and finished at Hampton Court Palace in Richmond upon Thames . Eighteen events were contested and around 500 athletes participated . Cycling events have been contested in every Summer Olympics programme since the first modern Olympiad in 1896 alongside athletics , artistic gymnastics , fencing and swimming . Compared to the cycling at the 2008 Olympics , there were many changes in the Olympic track cycling programme . The men 's and women 's individual pursuit and points race , and the men 's Madison were removed . Team sprint , team pursuit and keirin were added to the women 's programme , while Omnium was a new race for both men and women . Countries were restricted to one entry per track event , a restriction which seemed to be directed at preventing the British team from double-medalling in the same event as they had in four events in 2008 , thus lowering their medal chances . However , similar to the 2008 Beijing Games , the cycling events were dominated by the British team , which , with a haul including eight gold medals , was the only one to win more than a single gold medal .",
