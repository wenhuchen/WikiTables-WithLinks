  "/wiki/Straits_of_Mackinac": "The Straits of Mackinac ( /\u02c8m\u00e6k\u026an\u0254\u02d0/ MAK-in-aw ) are narrow waterways in the U.S. state of Michigan between Michigan 's Lower and Upper Peninsulas . The main strait flows under the Mackinac Bridge and connects two of the Great Lakes , Lake Michigan and Lake Huron . The main strait is 3.5 miles ( 5.6 km ) wide and has a maximum depth of 295 feet ( 90 m ) . Hydrologically , the two connected lakes can be considered one lake , which is called Lake Michigan-Huron . Historically , the native Odawa people called the region around the Straits Michilimackinac . The Straits of Mackinac are whipsawed by currents unlike anywhere else in the Great Lakes . Islands forming the edge of Straits of Mackinac include the two populated islands , Bois Blanc and Mackinac , and one that is uninhabited : Round island . The Straits of Mackinac are major shipping lanes , providing passage for raw materials and finished goods and connecting , for instance , the iron mines of Minnesota to the steel mills of Gary , Indiana . Before the railroads reached Chicago from the east , most immigrants arrived in the Midwest and Great Plains by ships on the Great Lakes . The straits are five miles ( 8 km ) wide at their narrowest point , where they are spanned by the Mackinac Bridge . Before the bridge was built , car ferries transported vehicles across the straits . Today passenger-only ferries carry people to Mackinac Island , which does not permit cars .",
  "/wiki/SS_Charles_S._Price": "The SS Charles S. Price was a steel hulled ship lost on Lake Huron on November 9 , 1913 during the Great Lakes storm of 1913 . The Price was found on 10 November 1913 with her bow above water , and her stern dipping below . Because of her disposition , the ship 's length could not be measured to make a positive identification of the vessel : the wreck was initially assumed to be the Regina . The vessel was eventually identified as the Price before she sank on 17 November . The salvage rights to the Price were sold to the Great Lakes Towing and Wrecking company . In the summer of 1916 , salvage of the Price was attempted . Divers cut a hole in the side of the aft hull . The hole allowed divers to enter the wreck . They attempted to seal breaks in the hull and built bulkheads so that the wreck could be floated . However , salvaging the wreck was eventually considered too costly to be worth the expense and the Great Lakes Towing and Wrecking company abandoned attempts to raise her . Salvage rights were eventually sold to the American Salvage Co. , but they too were unable to salvage the wreck .",
  "/wiki/Great_Lakes_Storm_of_1913": "The Great Lakes Storm of 1913 , historically referred to as the Big Blow , [ A ] the Freshwater Fury , or the White Hurricane , was a blizzard with hurricane-force winds that devastated the Great Lakes Basin in the Midwestern United States and Ontario , Canada from November 7 through November 10 , 1913 . The storm was most powerful on November 9 , battering and overturning ships on four of the five Great Lakes , particularly Lake Huron . Deceptive lulls in the storm and the slow pace of weather reports contributed to the storm 's destructiveness . The deadliest and most destructive natural disaster to hit the lakes in recorded history , the Great Lakes Storm killed more than 250 people , destroyed 19 ships , and stranded 19 others . The financial loss in vessels alone was nearly US $ 5 million ( or about $ 129,343,000 in today 's dollars ) . This included about $ 1 million at current value in lost cargo totalling about 68,300 tons , such as coal , iron ore , and grain . The storm , an extratropical cyclone , originated as the convergence of two major storm fronts , fueled by the lakes ' relatively warm waters - a seasonal process called a November gale . It produced 90 mph ( 140 km/h ) wind gusts , waves over 35 feet ( 11 m ) high , and whiteout snowsqualls . Analysis of the storm and its impact on humans , engineering structures , and the landscape led to better forecasting and faster responses to storm warnings , stronger construction ( especially of marine vessels ) , and improved preparedness .",
  "/wiki/SS_Choctaw": "SS Choctaw was a semi-whaleback freighter built by the Cleveland Shipbuilding Company in 1892 . She was a monitor vessel that was designed to evade Alexander McDougall 's patent on the whaleback vessel design . She sank on July 11 , 1915 , on Lake Huron after a collision with the Canadian package freighter Wahcondah .

  "/wiki/Georgian_Bay": "Georgian Bay ( French : Baie Georgienne ) is a large bay of Lake Huron , in the Laurentia bioregion . It is located entirely within the borders of Ontario , Canada . The main body of the bay lies east of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island . To its northwest is the North Channel . Georgian Bay is surrounded by ( listed clockwise ) the districts of Manitoulin , Sudbury , Parry Sound and Muskoka , as well as the more populous counties of Simcoe , Grey and Bruce . The Main Channel separates the Bruce Peninsula from Manitoulin Island and connects Georgian Bay to the rest of Lake Huron . The North Channel , located between Manitoulin Island and the Sudbury District , west of Killarney , was once a popular route for steamships and is now used by a variety of pleasure craft to travel to and from Georgian Bay . The shores and waterways of the Georgian Bay are the traditional domain of the Anishinaabeg First Nations peoples to the north and Huron-Petun ( Wyandot ) to the south . The bay was thus a major Algonquian-Iroquoian trade route . Samuel de Champlain , the first European to explore and map the area in 1615-1616 , called it La Mer douce ( the calm sea ) , which was a reference to the bay 's freshwater . In 1822 , after Great Britain had taken over the territory , Lieutenant Henry Wolsey Bayfield of a Royal Navy expedition named it as Georgian Bay ( after King George IV ) .",
  "/wiki/Cornelia_B._Windiate": "The Cornelia B. Windiate was a schooner that sank in 1875 with all hands , presumably in Lake Michigan near the Straits of Mackinac . The ship was eastbound from Milwaukee to Buffalo . The reason for her sinking is unknown , but she departed November 27 , late in the season , and was overloaded with grain . In 1986 The Windiate was discovered by divers in Lake Huron , near Alpena , Michigan , further east than expected . The wreck is unique in that her cargo is still secure in her holds which is quite unusual for a wreck . Her masts are still standing with rigging .",

  "/wiki/SS_Hydrus": "The SS Hydrus was an American steel-hulled Great Lakes bulk freighter , constructed in 1903 and launched as the R.E . Schuck . She was following the SS James Carruthers heading south on Lake Huron while carrying a load of iron ore when she and the Carruthers were caught in the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 . The Hydrus foundered and sank with a crew of twenty-four aboard on or around 8 November 1913 while heading for the St. Clair River . During the storm , waves were said to be 35 feet high along with wind gusts of 90 miles per hour . Five of the crew were found frozen to death in a lifeboat that washed ashore in Canada . The James Carruthers was also lost in the storm as well as the SS Argus , which was the sister ship of the Hydrus . The wreck of the Hydrus was located in the summer of 2015 by a team of shipwreck hunters led by David Trotter . The wreck is in over 160 feet of water , and is heavily encrusted with zebra mussels .

  "/wiki/Lake_freighter": "Lake freighters , or lakers , are bulk carrier vessels that ply the Great Lakes of North America . These vessels are traditionally called boats , although classified as ships . Since the late 19th century , lakers have carried bulk cargoes of materials such as limestone , iron ore , grain , coal , or salt from the mines and fields of the upper Great Lakes to the populous industrial areas farther east . The 63 commercial ports handled 173 million tons of cargo in 2006 . Because of winter ice on the lakes , the navigation season is not usually year-round . The Soo Locks and Welland Canal close from mid-January to late March , when most boats are laid up for maintenance . Crewmembers spend these months ashore . Depending on their application , lakers may also be referred to by their type , such as oreboats ( primarily for iron ore ) , straight deckers ( no self-unloading gear ) , bulkers ( carry bulk cargo ) , sternenders ( all cabins aft ) , self unloaders ( with self unloading gear ) , longboats ( for their slender appearance ) , or lakeboats , among others . In the mid-20th century , 300 lakers worked the Lakes , but by the early 21st century there were fewer than 140 active lakers . SS Edmund Fitzgerald , which sank in 1975 , became widely known as the most recent and largest major vessel to be wrecked on the Great Lakes .",
