  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha ( sometimes called cha-cha ) , is a dance of Cuban origin . It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s . This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo . The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers ' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps ( correctly , on the fourth count of each measure ) that characterize the dance . In the early 1950s , Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica . The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n , danzonete , and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds . Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo . To make his music more appealing to dancers , Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated . When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana , it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound cha-cha-cha . Thus , the new style came to be known as cha-cha-ch\u00e1 and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step . The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 ( one , two , three , cha-cha ) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion . For example , one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern .",

  "/wiki/Salsa_(dance)": "Salsa is a Latin dance associated with the music genre of the same name which originated in the 1960s in New York City . Salsa is an amalgamation of Cuban dances that were popular in the ballrooms and nightclubs of Havana by the end of the 1950s ( e.g . casino , mambo and pachanga ) , as well as American jazz dances . It was primarily developed by Puerto Ricans living in New York ( Nuyoricans ) in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as Cuban , Puerto Rican , Cali Colombia , L.A. and New York styles . Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs , bars , ballrooms , restaurants , and outside , especially when part of an outdoor festival . In many styles of salsa dancing , as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping , the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes . Weight shifts cause the hips to move . Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated . Salsa generally uses music ranging from about 150 bpm ( beats per minute ) to around 250 bpm , although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160-220 bpm . The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music . The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps .",
