  "/wiki/Ariane_5": "Ariane 5 is a European heavy-lift launch vehicle that is part of the Ariane rocket family , an expendable launch system designed by the French government space agency Centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales ( CNES ) . It is used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit ( GTO ) or low Earth orbit ( LEO ) . German and French government agencies worked closely together to develop the Ariane . Ariane 5 rockets are manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales . Airbus Defence and Space is the prime contractor for the vehicles , leading a multi-country consortium of other European contractors . Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by Arianespace as part of the Ariane programme . The rockets are launched by Arianespace from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana . Ariane 5 succeeded Ariane 4 , but was not derived from it directly as Ariane 5 was developed from scratch . Ariane 5 has been refined since the first launch in successive versions , G , G+ , GS , ECA , and most recently , ES . ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the Hermes spaceplane , and thus intended it to be human rated from the beginning . Ariane 5 has a commonly used dual-launch capability where up to two large geostationary belt communication satellites can be mounted using a SYLDA carrier ( Syst\u00e8me de Lancement Double Ariane , Ariane Double-Launch System ) . Up to three , somewhat smaller , main satellites are possible depending on size using SPELTRA ( Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement Triple Ariane , Ariane Triple-Launch External Carrier Structure ) .",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",

It was designed to launch payloads into low earth orbit , geosynchronous transfer orbit or geosynchronous orbit . Sixty-three launches of the Atlas II , IIA and IIAS models were carried out between 1991 and 2004 ; all sixty-three launches were successes , making the Atlas II the most reliable launch system in history .

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world .

European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

The Shavit project is believed to have been an offshoot development , resulting from Israel 's Jericho nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile program . Shavit rockets are launched from Palmachim Airbase by the Israel Space Agency into highly retrograde orbits over the Mediterranean Sea to prevent debris coming down in populated areas and also to avoid flying over nations hostile to Israel to the east ; this results in a lower payload-to-orbit than east-directed launches would allow . The launcher consists of three stages powered by solid-fuel rocket motors , with an optional liquid-fuel fourth stage , and is manufactured by IAI . The Republic of South Africa produced and tested a licensed version in cooperation with Israel called the RSA-3 in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to produce a domestic satellite launch vehicle and ballistic missile ; the South African program was closed in 1994 .
