  "/wiki/Tang_Dynasty": "The Tang dynasty ( /t\u0251\u02d0\u014b/ ; Chinese : \u5510\u671d [ a ] ) or the Tang Empire was an imperial dynasty of China that ruled from 618 to 907 , with an interregnum between 690 and 705 . It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant . In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries , the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people . Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people . [ b ] With its large population base , the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road . Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court , while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system . Besides political hegemony , the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring East Asian states such as those in Japan and Korea .",

It is a collection of rhetorical prose attributed to figures of ancient China , and served as the foundation of Chinese political philosophy for over 2,000 years . The Book of Documents was the subject of one of China 's oldest literary controversies , between proponents of different versions of the text . The New Text version was preserved from Qin Shi Huang 's burning of books and burying of scholars by scholar Fu Sheng . The longer Old Text version was supposedly discovered in the wall of Confucius ' family estate in Qufu by his descendant Kong Anguo in the late 2nd century BC , lost at the end of the Han dynasty and rediscovered in the 4th century AD . Over time , the Old Text version of the Documents became more widely accepted , until it was established as the imperially sanctioned edition during the early Tang dynasty . This continued until the late 17th century , when the Qing dynasty scholar Yan Ruoqu demonstrated that the additional Old Text chapters not contained in the New Text version were actually fabrications reconstructed in the 3rd or 4th centuries AD . The chapters are grouped into four sections representing different eras : the semi-mythical reign of Yu the Great , and the Xia , Shang and Zhou dynasties . The Zhou section accounts for over half the text . Some of its New Text chapters are among the earliest examples of Chinese prose , recording speeches from the early years of the Zhou dynasty in the late 11th century BC . Although the other three sections purport to record earlier material , most scholars believe that even the New Text chapters in these sections were composed later than those in the Zhou section , with chapters relating to the earliest periods being as recent as the 4th or 3rd centuries BC .",

Chapter 19 , for instance , has 32 stories about outstanding women . It is thus both a biographical source and a record of colloquial language . The original text of the book was divided into eight volumes of juan ( scroll ) , though current editions generally span ten volumes . Although most of the anecdotes and personalities are attested in other sources , traditional Chinese bibliographers did not classify Shishuo Xinyu as history but as minor talk ( xiao shuo ) , a term that was later used to refer to fiction . Literary historian Victor Mair comments that the bias against Tales of the World as legitimate work of history undoubtedly stemmed from its failure to subscribe to the sanctioned conventions of history enshrined in the dynastic histories and its use of lively and sometimes colloquial language . The mixture of literary and vernacular styles set the scene for the later tradition of informal Chinese literature . The 20th-century Chinese novelist Lu Xun also spoke highly of the book 's aesthetic merits .

Spanning over four centuries , the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history . To this day , China 's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the Han Chinese ( Han Zu ) and the Chinese script is referred to as Han characters . It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang , known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han , and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty ( 9-23 AD ) of the former regent Wang Mang . This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods : the Western Han or Former Han ( 206 BC - 9 AD ) and the Eastern Han or Later Han ( 25-220 AD ) . The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society . He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms . These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States . From the reign of Emperor Wu ( r. 141-87 BC ) onward , the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu . This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 AD .

It was founded by Sima Yan , son of Sima Zhao , who was made the King of Jin and posthumously declared one of the founders of the dynasty , along with Sima Zhao 's older brother Sima Shi and father Sima Yi . It followed the Three Kingdoms period ( 220-280 AD ) , which ended with the conquest of Eastern Wu by Jin , culminating in the reunification of China . There are two main divisions in the history of the dynasty . The Western Jin ( 266-316 ) was established as a successor state to Cao Wei after Sima Yan usurped the throne and had its capital at Luoyang and later Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) ; Western Jin reunited China in 280 but fairly shortly thereafter fell into a succession crisis , the War of the Eight Princes and suffered from the invasions instigated by the Five Barbarians ( Wu Hu ) . The rebels and invaders began to establish new self-proclaimed states along the Yellow River valley in 304 , inaugurating the Sixteen Kingdoms era . These states immediately began fighting each other and the Jin Empire , leading to the second division of the dynasty , the Eastern Jin ( 317-420 ) , when Sima Rui moved the capital to Jiankang ( modern Nanjing ) .

It has been played since ancient times , and has traditionally been favoured by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement , as highlighted by the quote a gentleman does not part with his qin or se without good reason , as well as being associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius . It is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as the father of Chinese music or the instrument of the sages . The guqin is not to be confused with the guzheng , another Chinese long zither also without frets , but with moveable bridges under each string . Traditionally , the instrument was simply referred to as the qin ( \u7434 ) but by the twentieth century the term had come to be applied to many other musical instruments as well : the yangqin hammered dulcimer , the huqin family of bowed string instruments , and the Western piano are examples of this usage . The prefix gu- ( \u53e4 ; meaning ancient ) was later added for clarification . Thus , the instrument is called guqin today . It can also be called qixian-qin ( \u4e03\u7d43\u7434 ; lit . seven-stringed zither ) . Because Robert Hans van Gulik 's book about the qin is called The Lore of the Chinese Lute , the guqin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute . Other incorrect classifications , mainly from music compact discs , include harp or table-harp . The guqin is a very quiet instrument , with a range of about four octaves , and its open strings are tuned in the bass register ."
