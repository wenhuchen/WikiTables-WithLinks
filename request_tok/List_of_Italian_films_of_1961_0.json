  "/wiki/Accattone": "Accattone is a 1961 Italian drama film written and directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini . Despite being filmed from an original screenplay , Accattone is often perceived as a cinematic rendition of Pasolini 's earlier novels , particularly The Ragazzi and Violent Life . It was Pasolini 's first film as director , employing what would later be seen as trademark Pasolini characteristics ; a cast of non-professional actors hailing from where the movie is set , and thematic emphasis on impoverished individuals . While many people were surprised by Pasolini 's shift from literature to film , he had considered attending the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome before World War II . Pasolini had collaborated with Federico Fellini on Le notti di Cabiria and considered cinema to be writing with reality . The word accattone [ akkat\u02c8to : ne ] is an informal term meaning vagabond or scrounger . Accattone is a story of pimps , prostitutes and thieves , types also represented in his novels . The life of the working ( and not-working ) poor is depicted , in contrast to Italy 's postwar economic reforms . Pasolinis choice of topics was scandalous at the time , as was his blurring of the lines between the sacred and the profane .
