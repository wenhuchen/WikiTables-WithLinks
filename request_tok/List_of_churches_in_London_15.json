  "/wiki/Highbury": "Highbury is a district in North London and part of the London Borough of Islington that was owned by Ranulf brother of Ilger and included all the areas north and east of Canonbury and Holloway Roads . The manor house was situated by what is now the east side of Hornsey Road near the junction with Seven Sisters Road . After the manor decayed , a new manor house was built in 1271 ( see below ) to the south-east ; to differentiate it from the original manor and because it was on a hill , it was called Highbury , from which the area takes its name . The site for Highbury Manor was possibly used by a Roman garrison as a summer camp . During the construction of a new Highbury House in 1781 , tiles were found that could have been Roman or Norman ; however , these have been lost .",
  "/wiki/Evangelical": "Evangelicalism ( /\u02cci\u02d0v\u00e6n\u02c8d\u0292\u025bl\u026ak\u0259l\u026az\u0259m , \u02cc\u025bv\u00e6n- , -\u0259n/ ) , evangelical Christianity , or evangelical Protestantism , [ note 1 ] is a worldwide , trans-denominational movement within Protestant Christianity which maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace , solely through faith in Jesus 's atonement . Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group . The main movements are Baptist churches , Pentecostalism , charismatic Evangelicalism , neo-charismatic Evangelicalism and nondenominational Evangelicalism .",
  "/wiki/Barnsbury": "Barnsbury is an affluent area of north London in the London Borough of Islington , in the N1 postal district . The name is a syncopated form of Bernersbury ( 1274 ) , being so called after the Berners family : powerful medieval manorial lords who gained ownership of a large part of Islington after the Norman Conquest . The area of Barnsbury was predominantly rural until the early nineteenth century . By the end of the 18th century , however , Barnsbury , like other parts of Islington , was being regarded as attractive part-rural suburbs by the comparatively wealthy people wanting to move out of the cramped City of London and industrial Clerkenwell . The area is close to the City , and had strong local trade in its position as the first staging post for travellers making the journey from London to the north , and with considerable agricultural traffic and cattle driving to the nearby Smithfield cattle market in the City . Pentonville Prison ( built 1842 ) is located within Barnsbury .",

  "/wiki/Quakers": "Quakers , also called Friends , are a historically Christian group whose formal name is the Religious Society of Friends or Friends Church . Members of the various Quaker movements are all generally united by their belief in the ability of each human being to experientially access the light within , or that of God in every one . Some may profess the priesthood of all believers , a doctrine derived from the First Epistle of Peter . They include those with evangelical , holiness , liberal , and traditional Quaker understandings of Christianity . There are also Nontheist Quakers whose spiritual practice is not reliant on the existence of God . To differing extents , the different movements that make up the Religious Society of Friends/Friends Church avoid creeds and hierarchical structures . In 2007 , there were about 359,000 adult Quakers worldwide . In 2017 , there were 377,557 adult Quakers , with 49% in Africa . Around 89% of Quakers worldwide belong to the evangelical and programmed branches of Quakerism - these Quakers worship in services with singing and a prepared message from the Bible , coordinated by a pastor . Around 11% of Friends practice waiting worship , or unprogrammed worship ( more commonly known today as Meeting for Worship ) , where the order of service is not planned in advance , is predominantly silent , and may include unprepared vocal ministry from those present . Some meetings of both types have Recorded Ministers in their meetings - Friends recognised for their gift of vocal ministry . The first Quakers lived in mid-17th-century England .",

Greek Orthodox Christianity has also traditionally placed heavy emphasis and awarded high prestige to traditions of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and asceticism , with origins in Early Christianity in the Near East and in Byzantine Anatolia . Historically , the term Greek Orthodox has also been used to describe all Eastern Orthodox Churches in general , since Greek in Greek Orthodox can refer to the heritage of the Byzantine Empire . During the first eight centuries of Christian history , most major intellectual , cultural , and social developments in the Christian Church took place within the Empire or in the sphere of its influence , where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings . Over time , most parts of the liturgy , traditions , and practices of the church of Constantinople were adopted by all , and still provide the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy . Thus , the Eastern Church came to be called Greek Orthodox in the same way that the Western Church is called Roman Catholic . However , the appellation Greek was abandoned by the Slavic and other Eastern Orthodox churches in connection with their peoples ' national awakenings , from as early as the 10th century A.D . Thus , today it is generally only those churches that are most closely tied to Greek or Byzantine culture that are called Greek Orthodox .",
