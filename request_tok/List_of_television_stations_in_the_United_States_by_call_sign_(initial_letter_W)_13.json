  "/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service": "The Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) is an American public broadcaster and television program distributor . It is a nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational television programming to public television stations in the United States , distributing series such as American Experience , America 's Test Kitchen , Antiques Roadshow , Arthur , Barney & Friends , Clifford the Big Red Dog , Downton Abbey , Finding Your Roots , Frontline , The Magic School Bus , Masterpiece , Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood , Nature , Nova , the PBS NewsHour , Reading Rainbow , Sesame Street , Teletubbies , and This Old House . PBS is funded by a combination of member station dues , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , National Datacast , pledge drives , and donations from both private foundations and individual citizens . All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source . Since the mid-2000s , Roper Opinion Research polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the most-trusted national institution in the United States . A 2016-2017 study by Nielsen Media Research found 80% of all US television households view the network 's programs over the course of a year . However , PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations , a large proportion of which may come from its member stations , including WGBH-TV , WETA-TV , WNET , WTTW , WHYY-TV , Twin Cities PBS , American Public Television , and independent producers . This distinction regarding the origin of different programs on the service present a frequent source of viewer confusion . PBS has more than 350 member television stations , many owned by educational institutions , nonprofit groups both independent or affiliated with one particular local public school district or collegiate educational institution , or entities owned by or related to state government .",

The city is the county seat of Erie County and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the Canada-United States border , forming part of the bi-national Buffalo Niagara Region . As of the April 1 , 2010 , the metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) had a population of 1,135,509 ; the combined statistical area ( CSA ) , which adds Cattaraugus County , had a population of 1,215,826 inhabitants . The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls . Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname The City of Light . The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by Joseph Ellicott , an extensive system of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted , as well as significant architectural works .",
