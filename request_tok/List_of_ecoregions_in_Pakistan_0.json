  "/wiki/Terrestrial_ecozone": "A biogeographic realm or ecozone is the broadest biogeographic division of the Earth 's land surface , based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms . They are subdivided into ecoregions , which are classified based on their biomes or habitat types . The realms delineate the large areas of the Earth 's surface within which organisms have been evolving in relative isolation over long periods of time , separated from one another by geographic features , such as oceans , broad deserts , or high mountain ranges , that constitute barriers to migration . As such , biogeographic realm designations are used to indicate general groupings of organisms based on their shared biogeography . Biogeographic realms correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology . Biogeographic realms are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain . They are distinct from biomes , also known as major habitat types , which are divisions of the Earth 's surface based on life form , or the adaptation of animals , fungi , micro-organisms and plants to climatic , soil , and other conditions . Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation . Each realm may include a number of different biomes . A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America , for example , may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure , climate , soils , etc. , but these forests are inhabited by animals , fungi , micro-organisms and plants with very different evolutionary histories . The patterns of distribution of living organisms in the world 's biogeographic realms were shaped by the process of plate tectonics , which has redistributed the world 's land masses over geological history .",
  "/wiki/Biome": "A biome /\u02c8ba\u026ao\u028am/ is a community of plants and animals that have common characteristics for the environment they exist in . They can be found over a range of continents . Biomes are distinct biological communities that have formed in response to a shared physical climate . Biome is a broader term than habitat ; any biome can comprise a variety of habitats . While a biome can cover large areas , a microbiome is a mix of organisms that coexist in a defined space on a much smaller scale . For example , the human microbiome is the collection of bacteria , viruses , and other microorganisms that are present on or in a human body . A 'biota ' is the total collection of organisms of a geographic region or a time period , from local geographic scales and instantaneous temporal scales all the way up to whole-planet and whole-timescale spatiotemporal scales .

It was previously known as the North-West Frontier Province until 2010 when the name was changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the 18th Amendment to Pakistan 's Constitution and is known colloquially by various other names . Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest province of Pakistan by the size of both population and economy , though it is geographically the smallest of four . Within Pakistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Punjab , Balochistan , Azad Kashmir , Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad . It is home to 17.9% of Pakistan 's total population , with the majority of the province 's inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindko speakers . The province is the site of the ancient kingdom Gandhara , including the ruins of its capital Pushkalavati near modern-day Charsadda . Originally a stronghold of Buddhism , the history of the region was characterized by frequent invasions by various empires due to its geographical proximity to the Khyber Pass . Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 , the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a major theatre of militancy and terrorism which intensified when the Taliban began an unsuccessful attempt to seize the control of the province in 2004 . With the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb against the Taliban insurgency , the casualty and crime rates in the country as a whole dropped by 40.0% as compared to 2011-13 , with even greater drops noted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas . As of July 2014 , about 929,859 people were reported to be internally displaced from North Waziristan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb . On March 2 , 2017 , the Government of Pakistan considered a proposal to merge the Federally Administered Tribal Areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , and to repeal the Frontier Crimes Regulations , which are currently applicable to the tribal areas . However , some political parties have opposed the merger , and called for the tribal areas to instead become a separate province of Pakistan .",

It consisted of seven tribal agencies ( districts ) and six frontier regions , and were directly governed by Pakistan 's federal government through a special set of laws called the Frontier Crimes Regulations . It bordered Pakistan 's provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to the east and south , and Afghanistan 's provinces of Kunar , Nangarhar , Paktia , Khost and Paktika to the west and north . The territory is almost exclusively inhabited by the Pashtun , who also live in the neighbouring provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Northern Balochistan , and straddle across the border into Afghanistan . They are mostly Muslim . Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 , the tribal areas are a major theatre of militancy and terrorism . Pakistan Army launched 10 operations against the Taliban since 2001 , most recently Operation Zarb-e-Azb in North Waziristan . The operations have displaced about two million people from the tribal areas , as schools , hospitals , and homes have been destroyed in the war . On 2 March 2017 , the federal government considered a proposal to merge the tribal areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , and to repeal the Frontier Crimes Regulations . However , some political parties have opposed the merger , and called for the tribal areas to instead become a separate province of Pakistan . On 24 May 2018 , the National Assembly of Pakistan voted in favour of an amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan for the FATA-KP merger which was approved by the Senate the following day . Since the change was to affect the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , it was presented for approval in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on 27 May 2018 , and passed with majority vote .",
  "/wiki/Montane_grasslands_and_shrublands": "Montane grasslands and shrublands is a habitat type defined by the World Wildlife Fund . The biome includes high altitude grasslands and shrublands around the world . The term montane in the name of the biome refers to high altitude , rather than the ecological term which denotes the region below treeline . This habitat type includes high elevation ( montane and alpine ) grasslands and shrublands , including the puna and p\u00e1ramo in South America , subalpine heath in New Guinea and East Africa , steppes of the Tibetan plateaus , as well as other similar subalpine habitats around the world . The plants and animals of tropical montane p\u00e1ramos display striking adaptations to cool , wet conditions and intense sunlight . Around the world , characteristic plants of these habitats display features such as rosette structures , waxy surfaces , and abundant pilosity . The p\u00e1ramos of the northern Andes are the most extensive examples of this habitat type . Although ecoregion biotas are most diverse in the Andes , these ecosystems are distinctive wherever they occur in the tropics . The heathlands and moorlands of East Africa ( e.g. , Mount Kilimanjaro , Mount Kenya , Rwenzori Mountains ) , Mount Kinabalu of Borneo , and the Central Range of New Guinea are all limited in extent , isolated , and support endemic plants and animals . Drier subtropical montane grasslands , savannas , and woodlands include the Ethiopian Highlands , the Zambezian montane grasslands and woodlands , and the montane habitats of southeastern Africa . The montane grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau still support relatively intact migrations of Tibetan antelope ( Pantholops hodgsoni ) and kiang , or Tibetan wild ass ( Equus hemionus ) . A unique feature of many tropical p\u00e1ramos is the presence of giant rosette plants from a variety of plant families , such as Lobelia ( Africa ) , Puya ( South America ) , Cyathea ( New Guinea ) , and Argyroxiphium ( Hawaii ) .",

It is the northernmost territory administered by Pakistan . It borders Azad Kashmir to the south , the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan to the north , the Xinjiang region of China , to the east and northeast , and the Indian-administered union territories Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to the southeast . Gilgit-Baltistan is part of the greater Kashmir region , which is the subject of a long-running conflict between Pakistan and India . The territory shares a border with Azad Kashmir , together with which it is referred to by the United Nations and other international organisations as Pakistan administered Kashmir . [ note 1 ] Gilgit-Baltistan is six times the size of Azad Kashmir . The territory also borders Indian-administered union territories Jammu and Kashmir ( union territory ) and Ladakh to the south and is separated from it by the Line of Control , the de facto border between India and Pakistan . The territory of present-day Gilgit-Baltistan became a separate administrative unit in 1970 under the name Northern Areas . It was formed by the amalgamation of the former Gilgit Agency , the Baltistan district and several small former princely states , the larger of which being Hunza and Nagar . In 2009 , it was granted limited autonomy and renamed to Gilgit-Baltistan via the Self-Governance Order signed by President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari , which also aimed to empower the people of Gilgit-Baltistan . However , scholars state that the real power rests with the governor and not with chief minister or elected assembly . The population of Gilgit-Baltistan wants to be merged into Pakistan as a separate fifth province and opposes integration with Kashmir .",
