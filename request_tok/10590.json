When avant-garde plays began to supersede traditional West End productions in the later 1950s he found no new suitable stage roles , and for several years he was best known in the theatre for his one-man Shakespeare show Ages of Man . From the late 1960s he found new plays that suited him , by authors including Alan Bennett , David Storey and Harold Pinter .
