  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales": "Tropical cyclones are ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales , according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin ( s ) they are located in . Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones , but some alternative scales also exist , such as accumulated cyclone energy , the Power Dissipation Index , the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index , and the Hurricane Severity Index . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Northern Hemisphere are unofficially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales . Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms . Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane , then it will be classified on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale , which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period . In the Western Pacific , the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin , which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period . The India Meteorological Department 's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the North Indian Ocean , and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Southern Hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on one of two scales , which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds : The Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale is used to classify systems within the Australian or South Pacific tropical cyclone basin . The scale used to classify systems in the South-West Indian Ocean is defined by Meteo France for use in various French territories , including New Caledonia and French Polynesia . The definition of sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10 m ( 33 ft ) . However , the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period , at 10 m ( 33 ft ) above the surface . The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period , and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval .",
  "/wiki/1860_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "During the 1860 Atlantic hurricane season , three severe hurricanes struck Louisiana and the Gulf Coast of the United States within a period of seven weeks . The season effectively began on August 8 with the formation of a tropical cyclone in the eastern Gulf of Mexico , and produced seven known tropical storms and hurricanes until the dissipation of the last known system on October 24 . Six of the seven storms were strong enough to be considered hurricanes on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale , of which four attained Category 2 status and one attained Category 3 major hurricane strength . The first hurricane was the strongest in both winds and pressure , with peak winds of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) and a barometric pressure of 950 millibars ( 28 inHg ) . Until contemporary reanalysis discovered four previously unknown tropical cyclones that did not affect land , only three hurricanes were known to have existed ; all three made landfall in Louisiana , causing severe damage . The first two hurricanes to strike the Gulf Coast - in August and September , respectively - caused significant inundation of low-lying and coastal communities , inflicting severe damage and killing dozens of people . In some cases , flood waters were more than 12 ft ( 3.7 m ) deep , and the center of destruction shifted slightly with each storm . Sugar cane crops were destroyed by these two systems as well as the succeeding storm in early October . Property and infrastructure suffered with all three events . With the third storm that made landfall , extreme winds blasted the city of New Orleans and surrounding areas . All other storms remained away from land with no effects except on shipping .",
  "/wiki/1861_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1861 Atlantic hurricane season occurred during the first year of the American Civil War and had some minor impacts on associated events . Eight tropical cyclones are believed to have formed during the 1861 season ; the first storm developed on July 6 and the final system dissipated on November 3 . Six of the eight hurricanes attained Category 1 hurricane status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale , of which three produced hurricane-force winds in the United States . No conclusive damage totals are available for any storms . Twenty-two people died in a shipwreck off the New England coast , and an undetermined number of crew members went down with their ship in the July hurricane . Based on maximum sustained winds , the first and third hurricanes are tied for the strongest of the year , although the typical method for determining that record - central barometric air pressure - is not a reliable indicator due to a general lack of data and observations . Four tropical storms from 1861 had been previously identified by scholars and hurricane experts , but three more were uncovered in modern-day reanalysis . Known tracks for most of the systems are presumed to be incomplete , despite efforts to reconstruct the paths of older tropical cyclones . Three systems completely avoided land . They all had an effect on shipping , in some cases inflicting severe damage on vessels . A storm in September , referred to as the Equinoctial Storm , hugged the East Coast of the United States and produced rainy and windy conditions both along the coast and further inland . The last storm of the season followed a similar track , and affected a large Union fleet of ships sailing to South Carolina for what would become the Battle of Port Royal .",
  "/wiki/1862_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1862 Atlantic hurricane season featured six tropical cyclones , with only one making landfall . The season had three tropical storms and three hurricanes , none of which became major hurricanes . [ nb 1 ] However , in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies , only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded , so the actual total could be higher . An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated . Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz initially documented five tropical cyclones in a 1995 report on this season . A sixth system was added by Michael Chenoweth in 2003 from records taken in Col\u00f3n , Panama . The first tropical cyclone was observed as a tropical storm offshore the East Coast of the United States from June 15 to June 17 . The second and third systems were active in mid-August and mid-September , respectively , and both attained Category 2 intensity at their peaks on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale and neither made landfall . A fourth tropical cyclone caused flooding in Saint Lucia and brought heavy rain to parts of Barbados on October 5 , but its track prior to that date is unknown . The fifth hurricane was known to be active for a few days in October off the East Coast of the United States . Finally , a sixth system was centered near Panama - between November 22 and November 25 .",
  "/wiki/1863_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1863 Atlantic hurricane season featured five landfalling tropical cyclones . In the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies , only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded , so the actual total could be higher . An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated . There were seven recorded hurricanes and no major hurricanes , which are Category 3 or higher on the modern day Saffir-Simpson scale . Of the known 1863 cyclones , seven were first documented in 1995 by Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Partag\u00e1s and Henry Diaz , while the ninth tropical storm was first documented in 2003 . These changes were largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database ( HURDAT ) , with some adjustments . Although it is not officially listed in HURDAT , Hurricane Amanda , named after a ship run aground by the storm , developed in the Gulf of Mexico on May 24 . First documented in 2013 by Michael Chenoweth and Cary Mock , the system capsized several other ships and caused damage along the coast of the Florida Panhandle . The cyclone made landfall near Apalachicola , Florida , exceptionally early in the season , on May 28 . Amanda holds the distinction of being the only known hurricane landfall in the United States in the month of May since HURDAT records began in 1851 . On land and at sea , the cyclone left at least 110 fatalities . Few other storms were notable .",
  "/wiki/1864_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1864 Atlantic hurricane season was the third consecutive Atlantic hurricane season with no hurricane landfall in the United States - the longest period on record . Of the five known 1864 cyclones , four were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz . In the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies , only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded , so the actual total could be higher . An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated . The first system was initially observed offshore the Southeastern United States on July 16 . It peaked as a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale . Moving rapidly northeastward , the storm was last noted well east of Newfoundland on July 18 . The next system was observed in the south-central Gulf of Mexico on July 25 . Because the cyclone was not tracked further , only a single-point storm path exists . After tropical cyclogenesis was dormant for over a month , another hurricane was spotted on August 26 to the east of Lesser Antilles . Early on the following day , the hurricane crossed the islands between Dominica and Martinique . After traversing the Caribbean Sea , the storm made landfall in Belize late on August 31 , before dissipating the next day .",
  "/wiki/1865_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1865 Atlantic hurricane season included two landfalling hurricanes , with one that caused over 325 deaths . The first storm was reported on May 30 by ships in the western Caribbean . A month later , a storm hit southern Texas , and in late August , a storm paralleled the coastline of the Carolinas . The fourth storm of the season was also the longest-lasting , forming east of the Lesser Antilles before hitting Guadeloupe and eventually moving ashore in Louisiana . In both of its major landfalls , the storm left many houses destroyed . There was confusion whether or not the fifth storm of the season was separate from the fourth storm , as both systems struck Louisiana in September . Another hurricane occurred in late September , before the final storm of the season developed north of Panama . The final hurricane struck Cuba and Key West , Florida before dissipating north of Bermuda on October 25 . At one time , one hurricane researcher identified a tropical storm over Cuba in late August , although there was no evidence the storm actually existed . There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October 22 , although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season . There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season . Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database , due to small tropical cyclone size , sparse ship reports , and relatively unpopulated coastlines .",
  "/wiki/1866_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1866 Atlantic hurricane season was originally one of only four Atlantic hurricane seasons in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status , along with 1852 , 1858 , and 1884 . Initially , there were three known storms during the season , but a re-analysis confirmed the increased activity . There were also two other systems that were included as tropical cyclones at one time , although both were considered to have been other storms already in the database . All tropical activity occurred between the middle of July and the end of October . There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season . Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates that up to six storms were missed from the official database , due to small tropical cyclone size , sparse ship reports , and relatively unpopulated coastlines . Every storm but the fourth hurricane affected land during the season . The first hurricane hit Matagorda , Texas in July , the only one of the season to hit the United States as a hurricane . A month later a hurricane made two landfalls in Mexico . The third hurricane of the season formed near Bermuda and was last observed along the southern coast of Newfoundland . A few weeks later another storm executed a similar track , although it struck Newfoundland as a hurricane and caused damage . The most notable storm of the season was the Great Nassau Hurricane , which killed at least 383 people in the Turks and Caicos , Bahamas , and the western Atlantic Ocean .",
  "/wiki/1867_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1867 Atlantic hurricane season lasted from mid-summer to late-fall . A total of nine known tropical systems developed during the season , with the earliest forming on June 21 , and the last dissipating on October 31 . On two occasions during the season , two tropical cyclones simultaneously existed with one another ; the first time on August 2 , and the second on October 9 . Records show that 1867 featured two tropical storms , six hurricanes and one major hurricane ( Category 3+ ) . However , in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies , only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded , so the actual total could be higher . An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated . Of the known 1867 cyclones Hurricanes Three , Four and Six plus Tropical Cyclones Five and Eight were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz . Hurricane One was first identified in 2003 by Cary Mock . The strongest storm of the season was Hurricane Nine , or the San Narciso hurricane . It developed in the Central Atlantic , and moved west to impact the Leeward Islands and Greater Antilles . The storm system was a major Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale , meaning the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 111-130 mph ( 178-209 km/h ) . This was the costliest , and deadliest , storm of the season , causing at least $ 1 million ( 1867 USD ) in damage , and at least 800 deaths across the Caribbean Sea .",
  "/wiki/1867_San_Narciso_hurricane": "The San Narciso Hurricane was the ninth and last known hurricane of the 1867 Atlantic hurricane season . Forming late in the month of October , the hurricane , the costliest and deadliest storm of the 1867 Atlantic hurricane season , caused at least 811 deaths in Saint Thomas ( Danish West Indies ) and Captaincy General of Puerto Rico and at least $ 1 million ( 1867 USD ) in damage .",
  "/wiki/1868_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1868 Atlantic hurricane season was among the quietest on record , with only four tropical cyclones recorded . Only three seasons had fewer storms than in 1868 , and seven had the same number of storms . Initially , there were no known storms during the season , although a re-analysis confirmed the activity . All tropical activity occurred within a 45 - day span . There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season . Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database , due to small tropical cyclone size , sparse ship reports , and relatively unpopulated coastlines . Only one of the storms , the second , made landfall , doing so near Apalachicola , Florida . It produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds across the southeastern United States , although there was no severe damage associated with the storm . The first hurricane killed two people when a ship passed through its winds for 14 hours . The third hurricane , located in the western Caribbean Sea , did not affect land , although two ships experienced its strong winds . The final hurricane lasted three days across the western Atlantic , forcing one ship to halt its voyage due to storm damage .",
  "/wiki/1869_Atlantic_hurricane_season": "The 1869 Atlantic hurricane season was the earliest season in the Atlantic hurricane database in which there were at least ten tropical cyclones . Initially there were only three known storms in the year , but additional research uncovered the additional storms . Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms may remain missing from the official database for each season in this era , due to small tropical cyclone size , sparse ship reports , and relatively unpopulated coastlines . All activity occurred in a three-month period between the middle of August and early October . Out of the ten tropical storms , seven reached hurricane intensity , of which four made landfall on the United States . The strongest hurricane was a Category 3 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale which struck New England at that intensity , one of four storms to do so . It left heavy damage , killing at least twelve people . The most notable hurricane of the season was the Saxby Gale , which was predicted nearly a year in advance . The hurricane was one of six to produce hurricane-force winds in Maine , where it left heavy damage and flooding . The Saxby Gale left 37 deaths along its path , with its destruction greatest along the Bay of Fundy ; there , the hurricane produced a 70.9 ft ( 21.6 m ) high tide near the head of the bay ."
