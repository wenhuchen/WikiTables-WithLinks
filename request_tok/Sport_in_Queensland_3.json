  "/wiki/Rugby_league": "Rugby league is a full-contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field measuring 68 m wide and 112-122 m long . One of the two codes of rugby football , it originated in Northern England in 1895 as a split from the Rugby Football Union over the issue of payments to players . Its rules progressively changed with the aim of producing a faster , more entertaining game for spectators . In rugby league , points are scored by carrying the ball and touching it to the ground beyond the opposing team 's goal line ; this is called a try , and is the primary method of scoring . The opposing team attempts to stop the attacking side scoring points by tackling the player carrying the ball . In addition to tries , points can be scored by kicking goals . Field goals can be attempted at any time , and following a successful try , the scoring team gains a free kick to try at goal with a conversion for further points . Kicks at goal may also be awarded for penalties . The Super League and the National Rugby League ( NRL ) are the premier club competitions . Rugby league is played internationally , predominantly by European , Australasian and Pacific Island countries , and is governed by the International Rugby League ( IRL ) . Rugby league is the national sport of Papua New Guinea , and is a popular sport in Northern England , Australia , North Island in New Zealand , France , Tonga , Fiji , Samoa and Lebanon . The first Rugby League World Cup was held in France in 1954 ; the current holders are Australia .",

The population of Rockhampton in June 2018 was 78,592 , making it the fourth-largest city in the state outside of the cities of South East Queensland , and the 22nd-largest city in Australia . Rockhampton is one of the oldest cities in Queensland and in Northern Australia . In 1853 , Charles and William Archer came across what is now also known as the Fitzroy River , which they named in honour of Sir Charles FitzRoy . The Archer brothers took up a run near Gracemere in 1855 , and more settlers arrived soon after , enticed by the fertile valleys . The town of Rockhampton was proclaimed in 1858 , and surveyed by Arthur F Wood and Francis Clarke , the chosen street design closely resembled the Hoddle Grid in Melbourne and consisted of a grid of wide boulevards and laneways , which was uncommon in Queensland . Within the year , gold was found at Canoona , and led to the first North Australian gold rush . This led to an influx of migrants who quickly transformed Rockhampton into the second-largest port in the state ; during this period , Rockhampton was nicknamed as the City of the Three S 's , of which were Sin , Sweat , and Sorrow . Subsequent gold rushes at Mount Morgan Mine , which was at the time one of the most productive gold mines in the world , laid the foundations for much of the city 's Victorian architecture . Today , Rockhampton is an industrial and agricultural centre of the north , and is the regional centre of Central Queensland . Rockhampton is also a large tourist destination known for its history and culture supporting such institutions as the Rockhampton Art Gallery , one of the most extensive regional galleries in Australia , the Central Queensland University with campuses across five states , the Rockhampton Heritage Village , and Dreamtime Cultural Centre .

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports .

The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat , while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player ( so they are out ) . Means of dismissal include being bowled , when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails , and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat , but before it hits the ground . When ten players have been dismissed , the innings ends and the teams swap roles . The game is adjudicated by two umpires , aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches . They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match 's statistical information . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs , to Test matches , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length . Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit , but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball , which is a hard , solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string . Historically , cricket 's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century .
