Partially in Wayne County , Utah , the area was originally named Wayne Wonderland in the 1920s by local boosters Ephraim P. Pectol and Joseph S. Hickman . Capitol Reef National Park was designated a national monument on August 2 , 1937 , by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to protect the area 's colorful canyons , ridges , buttes , and monoliths ; however , it was not until 1950 that the area officially opened to the public . Road access was improved in 1962 with the construction of State Route 24 through the Fremont River Canyon . The majority of the nearly 100 mi ( 160 km ) long up-thrust formation called the Waterpocket Fold - a rocky spine extending from Thousand Lake Mountain to Lake Powell - is preserved within the park . Capitol Reef is an especially rugged and spectacular segment of the Waterpocket Fold by the Fremont River . The park was named for its whitish Navajo Sandstone cliffs with dome formations - similar to the white domes often placed on capitol buildings - that run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold .
