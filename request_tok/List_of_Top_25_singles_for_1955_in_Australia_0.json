It was a number one single on both the United States and United Kingdom charts and also reentered the UK Singles Chart in the 1960s and 1970s . It was not the first rock and roll record , nor was it the first successful record of the genre ( Bill Haley had American chart success with Crazy Man , Crazy in 1953 , and in 1954 , Shake , Rattle and Roll sung by Big Joe Turner reached No . 1 on the Billboard R & B chart ) . Haley 's recording nevertheless became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth and is widely considered to be the song that , more than any other , brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world . The song is ranked No . 158 on the Rolling Stone magazine 's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . Although it was first recorded by Italian-American band Sonny Dae and His Knights on March 20 , 1954 , Myers claimed the song had been written specifically for Haley but , for various reasons , Haley was unable to record it himself until April 12 , 1954 . The original full title of the song was We 're Gon na Rock Around the Clock Tonight ! . This was later shortened to ( We 're Gon na ) Rock Around the Clock , though this form is generally only used on releases of the 1954 Bill Haley Decca Records recording ; most other recordings of this song by Haley and others ( including Sonny Dae ) shorten this title further to Rock Around the Clock .

From late 1954 to late 1956 , the group placed nine singles in the Top 20 , one of those a number one and three more in the Top Ten . The single Rock Around the Clock became the biggest selling rock and roll single in the history of the genre . Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country music performer ; after recording a country and western-styled version of Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats Rocket 88 , a rhythm and blues song , he changed musical direction to a new sound which came to be called rock and roll . Although several members of the Comets became famous , Bill Haley remained the star . With his spit curl and the band 's matching plaid dinner jackets and energetic stage behavior , many fans consider them to be as revolutionary in their time as the Beatles were a decade later .
