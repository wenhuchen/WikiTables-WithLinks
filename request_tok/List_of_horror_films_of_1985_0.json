The film features a cameo appearance from Corey Feldman , who portrayed Tommy in the previous film . A New Beginning features a high number of on-screen murders . Aside from its gore and violence , the film has also become known for its explicit nudity and sex scenes , as well as frequent drug use . Peter Bracke 's book Crystal Lake Memories : The Complete History of Friday the 13th details that behind the scenes , the production was plagued with hardcore drug use . Shot in California in 1984 on a budget of $ 2.2 million , A New Beginning was released theatrically on March 22 , 1985 , and grossed $ 22 million at the U.S. box office . The film was initially going to set up a new trilogy of films with a different villain for the series but , after a disappointing reception from fans and a steep decline in box-office receipts from Part III and The Final Chapter , Jason Voorhees was brought back for the next installment Jason Lives and has been the main antagonist in the series since . In addition to weak box office returns , most critics gave the film negative reviews .",
  "/wiki/Danny_Steinmann": "Danny Steinmann ( January 7 , 1942 - December 18 , 2012 ) was an American film director . Danny made his debut as both writer and director with the funky hardcore porno picture High Rise ( 1973 ) , on which he used the alias Danny Stone . Steinmann was a production associate on Arthur Hiller 's The Man in the Glass Booth ( 1975 ) and served as an associate producer on the offbeat Gene Roddenberry made-for-TV supernatural fright feature Spectre ( 1977 ) . In addition , Danny headed a production company in Puerto Rico that made TV commercials for such companies as International House of Pancakes , Chase Manhattan Bank and Wesson Oil . Danny directed and co-wrote the perverse psycho horror winner The Unseen ( 1980 ) . Dissatisfied with the finished version of the film , Steinmann attributed his directorial credit to the pseudonym Peter Foleg . He followed this film with the terrifically trashy teen exploitation action/revenge thriller doozy Savage Streets ( 1984 ) . Steinmann hit the relative big time with the mean-spirited slice- ' n'-dice sequel Friday the 13th : A New Beginning ( 1985 ) . Although the movie was a financial success , the production was very troubled and proved to be his cinematic swan song . He was announced as the director for a proposed sequel to the notorious The Last House on the Left ( 1972 ) but , alas , this project never came to be .",
