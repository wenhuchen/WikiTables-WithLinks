Competing in three Summer Olympics ( 04 , 08 , 12 ) he has won two medals in the C-1 1000 m event with a gold in 2008 and a bronze in 2004 .

In 2002 the pair came second at the European under-23 championships in Zagreb , Croatia in the same event . Hungarian coach Zolt\u00e1n Angyal was confident of Vajda 's ability but took the decision not to give him his senior international debut in 2002 or 2003 . In 2004 , Angyal was still keeping his cards close to his chest . The Hungarian team did not take part in the early season international regattas : at the European Championships Hungary was represented in the C-1 races by M\u00e1rton Jo\u00f3b and S\u00e1ndor Malomsoki . Angyal then shocked his rival coaches by selecting Vajda as his secret weapon for the 2004 Summer Olympics in the C-1 1000 m event . In his initial heat with a time of 3:57.290 , Vajda qualified for the semifinals . There , he placed second , this time at 3:52.236 , advancing to the final round . Vajda won a bronze in the event behind Spain 's David Cal and Germany 's Andreas Dittmer , but beat out 1996 Olympic champion Martin Doktor with a time of 3:49.025 . Hungary is one of the few countries in the world where sprint canoeists have the status of stars known to the general public and Vajda suddenly found himself the new golden boy of Hungarian canoeing .",
