  "/wiki/News_of_the_World": "The News of the World was a weekly national red top tabloid newspaper published every Sunday in the United Kingdom from 1843 to 2011 . It was at one time the world 's highest-selling English-language newspaper , and at closure still had one of the highest English-language circulations . It was originally established as a broadsheet by John Browne Bell , who identified crime , sensation and vice as the themes that would sell most copies . The Bells sold to Henry Lascelles Carr in 1891 ; in 1969 it was bought from the Carrs by Rupert Murdoch 's media firm News Limited . Reorganised into News International , a subsidiary of News Corporation , the newspaper was transformed into a tabloid in 1984 and became the Sunday sister paper of The Sun . The News of the World concentrated in particular on celebrity scoops , gossip and populist news . Its somewhat prurient focus on sex scandals gained it the nickname News of the Screws . In its last decade it had a reputation for exposing celebrities ' drug use , sexual peccadilloes , or criminal acts , by using insiders and journalists in disguise to provide video or photographic evidence , and covert phone hacking in ongoing police investigations . Sales averaged 2,812,005 copies per week in October 2010 . From 2006 , allegations of phone hacking began to engulf the newspaper . These culminated in the revelation on 4 July 2011 that , nearly a decade earlier , a private investigator hired by the newspaper had intercepted the voicemail of missing British teenager Milly Dowler , who was later found murdered . Amid a public backlash and the withdrawal of advertising , News International announced the closure of the newspaper on 7 July 2011 .",
  "/wiki/Pakistan_cricket_spot-fixing_controversy": "The Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal was a sports scandal centering on certain members of Pakistan 's national cricket team , who were convicted of taking bribes from a bookmaker , Mazhar Majeed , to deliberately underperform at certain pre-arranged moments during a Test match between England and Pakistan at Lord 's , London , in August 2010 . Undercover reporters from News of the World secretly videotaped Mazhar Majeed accepting money and informing the reporters that Pakistani fast bowlers Asif and Amir would deliberately bowl no-balls at specific points during the game . This information could be used by gamblers to place bets with inside information ( i.e . spot-fixing ) . In response to these allegations , Scotland Yard arrested Majeed on a charge of match fixing . The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) banned three Pakistan players - team captain Salman Butt , and the fast bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir - for terms of between 5 and 10 years . In November 2011 , Butt and Asif were also found guilty by a London court on criminal charges relating to spot-fixing . Amir and Majeed had entered guilty pleas on the same charges .

  "/wiki/United_Kingdom_Parliamentary_expenses_scandal": "The United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal was a major political scandal that emerged in 2009 , concerning expenses claims made by members of the United Kingdom Parliament over the previous years . The disclosure of widespread misuse of allowances and expenses permitted to Members of Parliament ( MPs ) aroused widespread anger among the UK public and resulted in a large number of resignations , sackings , de-selections and retirement announcements together with public apologies and the repayment of expenses . Several members or former members of both the House of Commons , and members of the House of Lords , were prosecuted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment . A February 2008 Freedom of Information Act request for the release of details of MPs ' expenses claims was allowed by an Information Tribunal but challenged by The House of Commons Authorities on the grounds that it was unlawfully intrusive . In May 2008 the High Court ( England and Wales ) ruled in favour of releasing the information . In April 2009 the House of Commons authorities announced that publication of expenses , with certain information deemed sensitive removed , would be made in July 2009 . But before this could take place the expenses records and documentation were leaked to The Daily Telegraph newspaper , which began publishing details in daily instalments from 8 May 2009 . These disclosures dominated the British media for weeks . On 18 June 2009 the details of all MPs ' expenses and allowance claims approved from 2004 to 2008 were published on the official Parliament website with detail such as addresses , claims that were not approved for payment and correspondence between MPs and the parliamentary fees office removed , bringing further accusations of unnecessary secrecy and allegations that this might have prevented serious abuses from being disclosed . Since most claims revolved around MPs ' second homes in London , a panel was established to investigate all claims relating to the second homes allowance between 2004 and 2008 . Headed by former civil servant Sir Thomas Legg , the panel published its findings on 12 October as MPs returned to Westminster following the summer recess . Each MP received a letter stating whether or not he or she would be required to repay any expenses claimed .",
