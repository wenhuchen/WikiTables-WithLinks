  "/wiki/NFL": "The National Football League ( NFL ) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the National Football Conference ( NFC ) and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) . The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 . The Green Bay Packers hold the most combined NFL championships with 13 , winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards . Since the creation of the Super Bowl , the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots both have the most championship titles at six .",

Several position coaches work under the coordinator ( position groupings can include quarterbacks , wide receivers , offensive line , running backs , and tight ends ) . The coordinator may also coach a position ( typically quarterbacks ) . Unlike most position coaches in football , who are usually on the sidelines during games , offensive coordinators have the option of operating from the press box instead of being on the sideline .

  "/wiki/Arena_Football_League_(1987\u20132008)": "The Arena Football League ( AFL ) was a professional indoor American football league in the United States . It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster , making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America , after the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) . The AFL played a proprietary code known as arena football , a form of indoor American football played on a 66-by-28 yard field ( about a quarter of the surface area of an NFL field ) , with rules encouraging offensive performance , resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game . The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster , a former executive of the United States Football League ( USFL ) and the NFL . From 2000 to 2009 , the AFL had its own developmental league , the af2 . The AFL played 22 seasons from 1987 to 2008 ; internal issues caused the league to cancel its 2009 season , though the af2 did play . Later that year both the AFL and af2 were dissolved and reorganized as a new corporation comprising teams from both leagues , and the AFL returned in 2010 . The league 's average game attendance after returning in 2010 was approximately 9,500 . The league historically had a nationwide footprint , and was recognized as the most prominent professional indoor football league in North America , offering higher payment , more widespread media exposure , and a longer history than competing leagues . From a high of 19 teams in 2007 , the league contracted to a low of four teams in 2018 , all in the northeastern United States . There were six teams playing in 2019 , the league 's final season .

  "/wiki/Safety_(American_football_position)": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",

  "/wiki/Halfback_(Canadian_football)": "The halfback in Canadian football , and most commonly the Canadian Football League , currently refers to the defensive back rather than the running back , as in American football . The defensive halfback lines up inside covering the slotback . They are usually slightly larger than the cornerback to assist the linebackers in stopping the run . They can also be seen backing off the line early , to counter the forward motion of a slotback , which is allowed before the snap in the CFL . The cause of the difference in naming between the two positions between the American and Canadian game , which otherwise uses the same names for positions , stems from the early history of the game . In both games , the early formations featured identical offensive and defensive formations , with seven down linemen and four players ( five in Canada ) in the backfield . Thus , both the offense and defense had quarterbacks , halfbacks and fullbacks . Over the course of the 20th century , the American and Canadian games both placed an increased emphasis on forward passing , resulting in both offensive and defensive formations spreading out and morphing into modern formations . Furthermore , the abolition of the one-platoon system in the 1940s led to a tendency for position names being used on only one side of the ball . The American game , which still held a significant running component ( modern American football is more balanced between both running and passing ) , kept two running backs , which led to the retention of the halfback and fullback identifications on that side of the ball . In Canadian football , however , passing was ( and still is ) a greater portion of the game ( due in part to the larger field and one less down in that game ) and only one running back was regularly used , leading to the offensive distinction between halfback and fullback eventually becoming obsolete . Historically , the offensive halfback was similar to a slotback and lined up off the tight end , running sweeps , pass patterns and performing blocking duties , but could also run out of the backfield in front of the fullback , much like a standard running back in American football .",

The Roughriders played their home games at historic Taylor Field from 1936 to 2016 ; in 2017 , the team moved to the newly-constructed Mosaic Stadium at Evraz Place .

They are currently members of the West Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . They play their home games at IG Field after many years of playing at the since demolished Canad Inns Stadium . The Blue Bombers were founded in 1930 as the Winnipeg Football Club , which has always been the organization 's legal name . Unlike most other professional teams in the four most popular North American team sports ( but much more common in soccer , especially in Europe ) the official legal name Winnipeg Football Club continues to see significant everyday use alongside its nickname , particularly in local media and especially when reporting on the club 's business affairs . Another unique aspect to the club compared to other North American professional sports teams ( but also more common in Europe ) is that it is organized as a corporation without share capital , meaning no one person or entity owns the team - while there are two other community-owned non-profit professional football teams in the CFL and one in the NFL , unlike the Winnipeg Football Club they all have shareholders . Since their establishment , the Blue Bombers have won the league 's Grey Cup championship 11 times , most recently in 2019 when they defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 in the 107th Grey Cup . The team holds the record for most Grey Cup appearances of any team ( 25 ) and were the first club not located in Ontario or Quebec to win a championship .",

He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city , Hamilton County , and Major League Baseball 's Cincinnati Reds ( who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field ) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games .

The Bengals , like the other former AFL teams , were assigned to the AFC following the merger .

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time ."
