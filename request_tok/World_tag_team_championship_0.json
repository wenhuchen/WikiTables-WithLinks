Promotion also describes a role which entails management , advertising and logistics of running a wrestling event ( see promoter ) .

  "/wiki/NWA_World_Tag_Team_Championship": "The NWA World Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling world tag team championship created by the National Wrestling Alliance . From 1948 to 1982 , the NWA allowed member promotions to create their own territorial version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship without oversight from the board of directors . The first of these NWA World Tag Team Championships was created in 1950 in the San Francisco territory , which while billed as a World title was essentially restricted to the specific NWA territory . In 1957 as many as 13 versions of the NWA World Tag Team Championship were confirmed to be in existence . In 1982 Big Time Wrestling , based in Los Angeles , closed and abandoned their version of the championship . This meant that only the Jim Crockett Promotions ' NWA World Tag Team Championship was active , but still being controlled by JCP , not the NWA board of directors . In 1991 that championship was renamed the WCW World Tag Team Championship . In 1992 the NWA board of directors decided to sanction one world-level NWA World Tag Team Championship , working with WCW to hold a tournament to determine the inaugural officially recognized , NWA World Tag Team Championship . In 1993 , the NWA and WCW severed their relationship and the NWA took with it the tag team championship . The NWA would briefly allow the World Wrestling Federation to control the championship in 1998 but by 1999 that collaboration ended . In 2002 the NWA gave control of the NWA World Tag Team Championship to the newly formed NWA Total Nonstop Action ( NWA-TNA ) promotion . TNA 's control of the championship ended in 2007 , with TNA creating the TNA World Tag Team Championship as a result .",

The group operated a territory system which sanctioned various championships , recognized one world champion , participated in talent exchanges , and collectively protected the territorial integrity of member promotions . Prior to the 1960s it acted as the sole governing body for most of professional wrestling . It remained the largest and most influential body in wrestling until the mid-1980s by which time most of the original member promotions went out of business as a result of the World Wrestling Federation 's national expansion . In September 1993 , the largest remaining member promotion , World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) , left the NWA for the second and final time . The NWA would continue as a loose coalition of independent promotions , with NWA : Total Nonstop Action ( NWA : TNA ) given exclusivity over its World Heavyweight and Tag Team championships from June 2002 to May 2007 .

Many wrestlers had left with Baba , with many more joining the following year when JWA folded . From the mid-1970s , All Japan was firmly established as the largest promotion in Japan . As the 90s began , aging stars gave way to a younger generation including Mitsuharu Misawa , Kenta Kobashi , Toshiaki Kawada and Akira Taue , leading to perhaps AJPW 's most profitable period in the 1990s . In 1999 , Giant Baba died and the promotion was ran by Motoko Baba . Misawa was named President but left in 2000 after disagreements with Motoko . Misawa created Pro Wrestling NOAH and every single native wrestler besides Masanobu Fuchi and Toshiaki Kawada left All Japan . This led to a loss of All Japan 's TV deal and a period of hardship for the company . In 2001 , they entered a cross-promotion agreement with New Japan Pro-Wrestling which proved very successful , allowing All Japan to remain one of the larger promotions in the country , although now firmly behind NJPW . In January 2002 , Misawa left . By mid-2005 , All Japan 's attendance had dropped and the promotion seemed to be in trouble again but by 2007 had new sponsors and seemed to have recovered . After Misawa and most of the other wrestlers left the promotion , there was a lull in developing new stars until the likes of KAI , Suwama , Hama and T28 debuted from the mid-2000s onward and helped restrengthen the company .",
