It features inclusive language , alternatives to traditional Christian expressions ( e.g. , Kingdom of God becomes Gods New World , and Son of Man becomes The Complete Person ) ; the text of Romans 1:26-27 in particular has been heavily altered in order to remove the condemnation of homosexuality . The order and sometimes names of books differ from most other versions , them being rearranged into three parts : Part One - Jesus and his friends ( Mark , Thomas , Matthew , Luke , Acts ) ; Part Two - Paul and his friends ( Romans , 1st Corinthians , 2nd Corinthians split into two books , and the remaining Pauline epistles ) ; and Part Three - The Four Calls ( James , 1st Peter , 1st John , Hebrews - all respectively renamed to The Call to \u2026 : Action , Hope , Love , Trust )",

  "intro": "The Bible has been translated into many languages from the biblical languages of Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. The Latin Vulgate translation was dominant in Western Christianity through the Middle Ages. Since then, the Bible has been translated into many more languages. English Bible translations also have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium. Included when possible are dates and the source language(s) and, for incomplete translations, what portion of the text has been translated. Certain terms that occur in many entries are linked at the bottom of the page. Because different groups of Jews and Christians differ on the true content of the Bible, the incomplete translations section includes only translations seen by their translators as incomplete, such as Christian translations of the New Testament alone. Translations such as Jewish versions of the Tanakh are included in the complete category, even though Christians traditionally have considered the Bible to consist properly of more than just the Tanakh."
