  "/wiki/Goal_(ice_hockey)": "In ice hockey , a goal is scored when the puck entirely crosses the goal line between the two goal posts and below the goal crossbar . A goal awards one point to the team attacking the goal scored upon , regardless of which team the player who actually deflected the puck into the goal belongs to ( see also own goal ) . Typically , a player on the team attempting to score shoots the puck with their stick towards the goal net opening , and a player on the opposing team called a goaltender tries to block the shot to prevent a goal from being scored against their team . The term goal may also refer to the structure in which goals are scored . The ice hockey goal is rectangular in shape ; the front frame of the goal is made of steel tube painted red ( blue in the ECHL because of a sponsorship deal with the Government Employees Insurance Company ) and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar . A net is attached to the back of the frame to catch pucks that enter the goal and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind . The entire goal is considered an inbounds area of the playing surface , and it is legal to play the puck behind the goal . Under NHL rules , the opening of the goal is 72 inches ( 180 cm ) wide by 48 inches ( 120 cm ) tall , and the footprint of the goal is 40 inches ( 100 cm ) deep .",
  "/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)": "In ice hockey , an assist is attributed to up to two players of the scoring team who shot , passed or deflected the puck towards the scoring teammate , or touched it in any other way which enabled the goal , meaning that they were assisting in the goal . There can be a maximum of two assists per goal . The assists will be awarded in the order of play , with the last player to pass the puck to the goal scorer getting the primary assist and the player who passed it to the primary assister getting the secondary assist . Players who gain an assist will get one point added to their player statistics . Despite the use of the terms primary assist and secondary assist , neither is worth more than the other , and neither is worth more or less than a goal . Assists and goals are added together on a player 's scoresheet to display that player 's career points . [ citation needed ]",

Following this initial grace period , the franchise struggled between the 1940s and 1960s , whereby playoff appearances and success was infrequent . The team enjoyed a mini renaissance in the 1970s , where they made the Stanley Cup finals twice , albeit , losing to the Bruins in 1972 and the Canadiens in 1979 . The Rangers subsequently embraced a rebuild for much of the 1980s and early 1990s , which eventually paid dividends , where the team , led by Mark Messier , Brian Leetch , Adam Graves , and Mike Richter , captured their fourth Stanley Cup in 1994 . The team was unable to duplicate that success in the years that followed , and entered into another period of mediocrity . They endured a franchise-record seven-year postseason drought from 1998 to 2005 , and languished for the majority of the 2000s before enjoying another period of prosperity after the 2004-05 NHL Lockout .",

  "/wiki/Joe_Sakic": "Joseph Steven Sakic ( /\u02c8s\u00e6k\u026ak/ ; born July 7 , 1969 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and former player . He played his entire 21-year National Hockey League ( NHL ) career with the Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche franchise . Named captain of the team in 1992 ( after serving as a co-captain in 1990-91 ) , Sakic is regarded as one of the greatest team leaders in league history and was able to consistently motivate his team to play at a winning level . Sakic led the Avalanche to Stanley Cup titles in 1996 and 2001 , being named the most valuable player of the 1996 playoffs , and honoured as the MVP of the NHL in 2001 by the hockey writers and his fellow players . He is one of six players to participate in both of the team 's Stanley Cup victories . Sakic was also named to play in 13 NHL All-Star Games and selected to the NHL First All-Star Team at centre three times . Over the course of his career , Sakic was one of the most productive forwards in the game , having twice scored 50 goals and earning at least 100 points in six different seasons . His wrist shot , considered one of the best in the NHL , was the source of much of his production as goalies around the league feared his rapid snap-shot release . At the conclusion of the 2008-09 NHL season , he was the eighth all-time points leader in the NHL , as well as 14th in all-time goals and 11th in all-time assists . During the 2002 Winter Olympics , Sakic helped lead Team Canada to its first ice hockey gold medal in 50 years , and was voted as the tournament 's most valuable player . He represented the team in six other international competitions , including the 1998 and 2006 Winter Olympics . Sakic retired from the NHL on July 9 , 2009 , and had his jersey number retired prior to the Avalanche 's 2009-10 season opener on October 1 , 2009 , at Pepsi Center .",
