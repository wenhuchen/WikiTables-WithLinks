  "/wiki/Stanley_Cup": "The Stanley Cup ( French : La Coupe Stanley ) is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) playoff winner . It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise in North America , and the International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) considers it to be one of the most important championships available to the sport . The trophy was commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup and is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , the Governor General of Canada who donated it as an award to Canada 's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club . The entire Stanley family supported the sport , the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal Hockey Club , and winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , professional ice hockey organizations National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup . It was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 . There are actually three Stanley Cups : the original bowl of the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the authenticated Presentation Cup , and the spelling-corrected Permanent Cup on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame . While the NHL has maintained control over the trophy itself and its associated trademarks ; the NHL does not actually own the trophy but uses it by agreement with the two Canadian trustees of the cup . The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup , although there has been dispute as to whether the league has the right to own trademarks associated with a trophy that it does not own . The original bowl was made of silver and is 18.5 centimetres ( 7.69 inches ) high and 29 centimetres ( 11.420 inches ) wide .",
