All Saint 's Parish was one of the thirty original Anglican parishes created in 1692 to encompass the Province of Maryland . In 1693 its first parish church , a log structure , was built on an acre of land called Kemp 's Desire donated by Thomas Hillary . This log church was expanded in 1703-1704 and repaired at least 4 times before being replaced on top of the hill between MD routes 4 , 262 , and 2 by the present brick building . Built between 1774 and 1777 , the present church building is a Georgian structure of Flemish bond brick with random glazed headers . Since All Saint 's Parish was part of the established church of the Province of Maryland , the published volumes of the Archives of Maryland contain pertinent documented source material on the building showing that it was built with county taxes while future bishop Thomas Claggett served as its rector . All Saints ' Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 . All Saints ' Church remains an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland .

  "/wiki/Maryland_Route_4": "Maryland Route 4 ( MD 4 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The highway runs 64.85 miles ( 104.37 km ) from MD 5 in Leonardtown north to Southern Avenue in Suitland at the District of Columbia boundary , beyond which the highway continues into Washington as Pennsylvania Avenue . MD 4 is a four- to six-lane highway that connects Washington and communities around the Capital Beltway ( Interstate 95 and I-495 ) with southern Prince George 's County with southwestern Anne Arundel County . The highway is the primary highway for the length of Calvert County , during most of which the route runs concurrently with MD 2 . MD 4 also connects Calvert and St. Mary 's counties via the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge across the Patuxent River . The highway connects the Southern Maryland county seats of Leonardtown , Prince Frederick , and Upper Marlboro . MD 4 is one of the original Maryland state highways . The state highway followed roughly its present alignment through Prince George 's County , then headed east through Anne Arundel County along what is now MD 408 . In the 1960s , MD 4 took over MD 416 ( Southern Maryland Boulevard ) southeast to Sunderland and joined MD 2 all the way to Solomons . After the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge opened in the late 1970s , MD 4 was extended west from Solomons to Leonardtown . MD 4 has been upgraded to a divided highway for most of its length , beginning in the early 1960s from Washington , reaching Solomons in the mid-1980s , and expected to continue into St. Mary 's County in the 2010s .",

Upon reaching Annapolis , the route runs concurrent with US 50 and US 301 around the city . Between Annapolis and Baltimore , MD 2 runs along the Governor Ritchie Highway ( also known as the Ritchie Highway ) , a multilane divided highway that heads through suburban areas , passing through Arnold , Severna Park , Pasadena , Glen Burnie , and Brooklyn Park . In Baltimore , the route heads north on city streets and passes through the downtown area of the city . What would become part of MD 2 was originally planned as two different state roads in 1909 . The portion between Solomons and Annapolis was built as a gravel road called Solomons Island Road between 1910 and 1915 . The portion of road between Annapolis and Glen Burnie was built as part of the Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard , a road authorized in 1910 to connect Baltimore and Annapolis and was completed in 1924 with the construction of a bridge over the Severn River leading to Annapolis .
