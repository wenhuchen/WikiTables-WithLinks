  "/wiki/All_in_the_Family": "All in the Family is an American sitcom television series that was originally broadcast on the CBS television network for nine seasons , from January 12 , 1971 , to April 8 , 1979 . The following September , it was continued with the spin-off series Archie Bunker 's Place , which picked up where All in the Family had ended and ran for four more seasons through 1983 . All in the Family was produced by Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin . It starred Carroll O'Connor , Jean Stapleton , Sally Struthers , and Rob Reiner . The show revolves around the life of a working-class father and his family . The show broke ground in its depiction of issues previously considered unsuitable for a U.S. network television comedy , such as racism , antisemitism , infidelity , homosexuality , women 's liberation , rape , religion , miscarriages , abortion , breast cancer , the Vietnam War , menopause , and impotence . Through depicting these controversial issues , the series became arguably one of television 's most influential comedic programs , as it injected the sitcom format with more dramatic moments and realistic , topical conflicts . All in the Family is often regarded in the United States as one of the greatest television series of all time . Following a lackluster first season , the show soon became the most watched show in the United States during summer reruns and afterwards ranked number one in the yearly Nielsen ratings from 1971 to 1976 . It became the first television series to reach the milestone of having topped the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive years . The episode Sammy 's Visit was ranked number 13 on TV Guide 's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time . TV Guide 's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time ranked All in the Family as number four .",
  "/wiki/Till_Death_Us_Do_Part": "Till Death Us Do Part is a British television sitcom that aired on BBC1 from 1965 to 1975 . The show was first broadcast as a Comedy Playhouse pilot , then in seven series until 1975 . Six years later in 1981 , ITV continued the sitcom for six episodes , calling it Till Death . The BBC produced a sequel from 1985 until 1992 , In Sickness and in Health . Created by Johnny Speight , Till Death Us Do Part centred on the East End Garnett family , led by patriarch Alf Garnett ( Warren Mitchell ) , a reactionary white working-class man who holds racist , prejudiced and anti-socialist views . His long-suffering wife Else was played by Dandy Nichols , and his daughter Rita by Una Stubbs . Rita 's husband Mike Rawlins ( Anthony Booth ) is a socialist layabout from Liverpool who frequently locks horns with Garnett . Alf Garnett became a well-known character in British culture , and Mitchell played him on stage and television until Speight 's death in 1998 . In addition to the spin-off In Sickness and in Health , Till Death Us Do Part was remade in several countries including Brazil ( A Grande Fam\u00edlia ) , Germany ( Ein Herz und eine Seele ) , and the Netherlands ( In voor- en tegenspoed [ nl ] ) , and it is the show that inspired All in the Family in the United States . Many episodes from the first three series are thought to no longer exist , having been wiped in the late 1960s and early 1970s as was the policy at the time . Although Speight said he wrote the series to challenge racism , it was felt by some critics that many people watched it because they agreed with Alf Garnett 's views . The linguist Alan Crosby has argued that the constant use of the phrase Scouse git with reference to Anthony Booth 's character spread both the word Scouse and negative stereotypes of Liverpudlians .",

  "/wiki/Fawlty_Towers": "Fawlty Towers is a British television sitcom written by John Cleese and Connie Booth and broadcast on BBC2 in 1975 and 1979 . Two series of six episodes each were made . The show was ranked first on a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 , and in 2019 it was named the greatest ever British TV sitcom by a panel of comedy experts compiled by the Radio Times . The series is set in Fawlty Towers , a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay on the English Riviera . The plots centre on the tense , rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty ( Cleese ) , his bossy wife Sybil ( Prunella Scales ) , the sensible chambermaid Polly ( Booth ) who often is the peacemaker and voice of reason , and the hapless and English-challenged Spanish waiter Manuel ( Andrew Sachs ) , showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests and tradespeople . The idea of the show came from Cleese after he stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay , Devon in 1970 ( along with the rest of the Monty Python troupe ) where he encountered the eccentric hotel owner Donald Sinclair . Stuffy and snobbish , Sinclair treated guests as though they were a hindrance to his running of the hotel ( a waitress who worked for him stated it was as if he did n't want the guests to be there ) . Sinclair was the inspiration for Cleese 's character Basil Fawlty . In 1980 , Cleese received the BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance , and in a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4 Basil Fawlty was ranked second on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters . The popularity of Fawlty Towers has endured , and it is often re-broadcast . The BBC profile for the series states , the British sitcom by which all other British sitcoms must be judged , Fawlty Towers withstands multiple viewings , is eminently quotable ( 'do n't mention the war ' ) , and stands up to this day as a jewel in the BBC 's comedy crown .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
