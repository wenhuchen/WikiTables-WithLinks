  "/wiki/Guqin": "The guqin ( [ ku\u0300t\u0255\u02b0i\u030cn ] ( listen ) ; Chinese : \u53e4\u7434 ) is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family . It has been played since ancient times , and has traditionally been favoured by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement , as highlighted by the quote a gentleman does not part with his qin or se without good reason , as well as being associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius . It is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as the father of Chinese music or the instrument of the sages . The guqin is not to be confused with the guzheng , another Chinese long zither also without frets , but with moveable bridges under each string . Traditionally , the instrument was simply referred to as the qin ( \u7434 ) but by the twentieth century the term had come to be applied to many other musical instruments as well : the yangqin hammered dulcimer , the huqin family of bowed string instruments , and the Western piano are examples of this usage . The prefix gu- ( \u53e4 ; meaning ancient ) was later added for clarification . Thus , the instrument is called guqin today . It can also be called qixian-qin ( \u4e03\u7d43\u7434 ; lit . seven-stringed zither ) . Because Robert Hans van Gulik 's book about the qin is called The Lore of the Chinese Lute , the guqin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute . Other incorrect classifications , mainly from music compact discs , include harp or table-harp . The guqin is a very quiet instrument , with a range of about four octaves , and its open strings are tuned in the bass register .",

Except for a five-year period ( 740-745 ) , when the capital was briefly moved again , it remained the capital of Japanese civilization until Emperor Kanmu established a new capital , Nagaoka-ky\u014d , in 784 , before moving to Heian-ky\u014d , modern Kyoto , a decade later in 794 . Japanese society during this period was predominately agricultural and centered around village life . Most of the villagers followed a religion based on the worship of natural and ancestral spirits named kami which is Shintoism The capital at Nara was modeled after Chang'an , the capital city of the Tang dynasty . In many other ways , the Japanese upper classes patterned themselves after the Chinese , including adopting the Chinese writing system , Chinese fashion , and a Chinese version of Buddhism .",

It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant . In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries , the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people . Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people . [ b ] With its large population base , the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road . Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court , while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system . Besides political hegemony , the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring East Asian states such as those in Japan and Korea .",

They are present in much of China , south to northern Laos and Vietnam and are long cultivated elsewhere in eastern Asia , notably in Japan and Korea where they are native . It was introduced to North America in 1844 from Europe and Asia where it was originally sought after as an exotic ornamental tree . Its fruits ( botanically capsules ) were also used as packaging material for goods shipped from East Asia to North America , leading to Paulownia groves where they were dumped near major ports . The tree has not persisted prominently in US gardens , in part due to its overwintering brown fruits that some consider ugly . In some areas it has escaped cultivation and is found in disturbed plots . Some US authorities consider the genus an invasive species , but in Europe , where it is also grown in gardens , it is not regarded as invasive .",

Originally a small fishing village named Edo ( \u6c5f\u6238 ) , the city became a prominent political center of Japan when Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters in 1603 . When Emperor Meiji moved the imperial seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868 , Edo was renamed Tokyo , literally the Eastern Capital . The Tokyo Metropolis formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e9c , T\u014dky\u014d-fu ) and the city of Tokyo ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e02 , T\u014dky\u014d-shi ) .

  "/wiki/Maki-e": "Maki-e ( \u8494\u7d75 , literally : sprinkled picture ) is Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder as a decoration using a makizutsu or a kebo brush . The oldest Maki-e in existence now is the ornamentation on the sheath of the Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay in Togidashi technique held by Sh\u014ds\u014din in Nara , Japan . Originally the sword was treasured by the Emperor Sh\u014dmu ( 701 - June 4 , 756 ) The technique was developed mainly in the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) and blossomed in the Edo period ( 1603-1868 ) . Maki-e objects were initially designed as household items for court nobles ; they soon gained more popularity and were adopted by royal families and military leaders as a symbol of power . To create different colours and textures , maki-e artists use a variety of metal powders including gold , silver , copper , brass , lead , aluminum , platinum , and pewter , as well as their alloys . Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines . As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting , young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters . K\u014dami D\u014dch\u014d ( 1410-1478 ) was the first lacquer master linked to specific works . His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters . K\u014dami and another maki-e master , Igarashi Shinsai , were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of Japan . Takamakie ( or raised maki-e ) is one of the three major techniques in maki-e making . Developed in the Muromachi period ( 1336-1573 ) , the technique of takamakie involves building up design patterns above the surface through a mixture of metal powder , lacquer , and charcoal or clay dust .",

  "/wiki/Dowry": "A dowry is a transfer of parental property , gifts , or money at the marriage of a daughter ( bride ) . Dowry contrasts with the related concepts of bride price and dower . While bride price or bride service is a payment by the groom side or his family to the bride 's parents , dowry is the wealth transferred from the bride 's family to the groom or his family , ostensibly for the bride . Similarly , dower is the property settled on the bride herself , by the groom at the time of marriage , and which remains under her ownership and control . Dowry is an ancient custom , and its existence may well predate records of it . Dowries continue to be expected and demanded as a condition to accept a marriage proposal in some parts of the world , mainly in parts of Asia , Northern Africa and the Balkans . In some parts of the world , disputes related to dowry sometimes result in acts of violence against women , including killings and acid attacks . The custom of dowry is most common in cultures that are strongly patrilineal and that expect women to reside with or near their husband 's family ( patrilocality ) . Dowries have long histories in Europe , South Asia , Africa and other parts of the world .",
