  "/wiki/Software_engineer": "A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design , development , maintenance , testing , and evaluation of computer software . Prior to the mid-1970s , software practitioners generally called themselves computer scientists , computer programmers or software developers , regardless of their actual jobs . Many people prefer to call themselves software developer and programmer , because most widely agree what these terms mean , while the exact meaning of software engineer is still being debated .",
  "/wiki/Extreme_Programming": "Extreme programming ( XP ) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements . As a type of agile software development , it advocates frequent releases in short development cycles , which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted . Other elements of extreme programming include : programming in pairs or doing extensive code review , unit testing of all code , avoiding programming of features until they are actually needed , a flat management structure , code simplicity and clarity , expecting changes in the customer 's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood , and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers . The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to extreme levels . As an example , code reviews are considered a beneficial practice ; taken to the extreme , code can be reviewed continuously , i.e . the practice of pair programming .",
  "/wiki/Test_Driven_Development": "Test-driven development ( TDD ) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle : requirements are turned into very specific test cases , then the code is improved so that the tests pass . This is opposed to software development that allows code to be added that is not proven to meet requirements . American software engineer Kent Beck , who is credited with having developed or rediscovered the technique , stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence . Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming , begun in 1999 , but more recently has created more general interest in its own right . Programmers also apply the concept to improving and debugging legacy code developed with older techniques .",
  "/wiki/Software_development_methodologies": "In software engineering , a software development process is the process of dividing software development work into distinct phases to improve design , product management , and project management . It is also known as a software development life cycle ( SDLC ) . The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application . Most modern development processes can be vaguely described as agile . Other methodologies include waterfall , prototyping , iterative and incremental development , spiral development , rapid application development , and extreme programming . Some people [ who ? ] consider a life-cycle model a more general term for a category of methodologies and a software development process a more specific term to refer to a specific process chosen by a specific organization . For example , there are many specific software development processes that fit the spiral life-cycle model . The field is often considered a subset of the systems development life cycle .",

  "/wiki/X-ray_crystallography": "X-ray crystallography ( XRC ) is the experimental science determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal , in which the crystalline structure causes a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions . By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams , a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal . From this electron density , the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined , as well as their chemical bonds , their crystallographic disorder , and various other information . Since many materials can form crystals - such as salts , metals , minerals , semiconductors , as well as various inorganic , organic , and biological molecules - X-ray crystallography has been fundamental in the development of many scientific fields . In its first decades of use , this method determined the size of atoms , the lengths and types of chemical bonds , and the atomic-scale differences among various materials , especially minerals and alloys . The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules , including vitamins , drugs , proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA . X-ray crystallography is still the primary method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments . X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material , shed light on chemical interactions and processes , or serve as the basis for designing pharmaceuticals against diseases . In a single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement , a crystal is mounted on a goniometer . The goniometer is used to position the crystal at selected orientations . The crystal is illuminated with a finely focused monochromatic beam of X-rays , producing a diffraction pattern of regularly spaced spots known as reflections . The two-dimensional images taken at different orientations are converted into a three-dimensional model of the density of electrons within the crystal using the mathematical method of Fourier transforms , combined with chemical data known for the sample .",

  "/wiki/Image_processing": "In computer science , digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm . As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing , digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing . It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and distortion during processing . Since images are defined over two dimensions ( perhaps more ) digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems . The generation and development of digital image processing are mainly affected by three factors : first , the development of computers ; second , the development of mathematics ( especially the creation and improvement of discrete mathematics theory ) ; third , the demand for a wide range of applications in environment , agriculture , military , industry and medical science has increased .",

In 1924 , Murphy bled dogs to make them anemic ( work inspired by war injury work ) , and then fed them various substances to gauge their improvement . He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to restore anemia more quickly of all foods . Minot and Whipple then set about to chemically isolate the curative substance . These investigations showed that iron in the liver was responsible for curing anemia from bleeding , but meanwhile liver had been tried on people with pernicious anemia and some effect as seen there , also . The active ingredient in this case , found serendipitously , was not iron , but rather a water-soluble extract containing a new substance .",

  "/wiki/Biochemistry": "Biochemistry , sometimes called biological chemistry , is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms . Biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life . A sub-discipline of both biology and chemistry , biochemistry can be divided in three fields ; structural biology , enzymology and metabolism . Over the last decades of the 20th century , biochemistry has through these three disciplines become successful at explaining living processes . Almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and research . Biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis which allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells , which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues , organs , and organism structure and function . Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology , the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena . Much of biochemistry deals with the structures , functions and interactions of biological macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates and lipids , which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life . The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions . These can be inorganic , for example water and metal ions , or organic , for example the amino acids , which are used to synthesize proteins . The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism . The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine , nutrition , and agriculture .",

  "/wiki/Ribosome": "Ribosomes ( /\u02c8ra\u026ab\u0259\u02ccso\u028am , -bo\u028a-/ ) ( named also Palade 's corpuscles ) comprise a complex macromolecular machine , found within all living cells , that serves as the site of biological protein synthesis ( translation ) . Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules . Ribosomes consist of two major components : the small ribosomal subunits , which read the mRNA , and the large subunits , which join amino acids to form a polypeptide chain . Each subunit consists of one or more ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) molecules and a variety of ribosomal proteins ( r-protein or rProtein ) . The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the translational apparatus .",
