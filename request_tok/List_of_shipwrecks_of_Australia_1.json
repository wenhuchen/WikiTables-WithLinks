  "/wiki/Patrol_boat": "A patrol boat ( also referred to as a patrol craft , patrol ship or patrol vessel ) is a relatively small naval vessel generally designed for coastal defence duties . There have been many designs for patrol boats . They may be operated by a nation 's navy , coast guard , police force or customs and may be intended for marine ( blue water ) or estuarine or river ( brown water ) environments . They are commonly found engaged in various border protection roles , including anti-smuggling , anti-piracy , fisheries patrols , and immigration law enforcement . They are also often called upon to participate in rescue operations . Vessels of this type include the original yacht ( from Dutch/Low German jacht meaning hunting or hunt ) , a light , fast-sailing vessel used by the Dutch navy to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into shallow waters .",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Tracy": "Cyclone Tracy was a tropical cyclone that devastated the city of Darwin , Northern Territory , Australia from 24 to 26 December 1974 . The storm was the second-smallest tropical cyclone on record ( in terms of gale-force wind diameter ) , behind only Tropical Storm Marco in 2008 . The small , developing easterly storm had been observed passing clear of the city initially , but then turned towards it early on 24 December . After 10:00 p.m. ACST , damage became severe , and wind gusts reached 217 kilometres per hour ( 134.84 mph ) before instruments failed . Residents of Darwin were celebrating Christmas , and did not immediately acknowledge the emergency , partly because they had been alerted to an earlier cyclone ( Selma ) that passed west of the city . Additionally , news outlets had only a skeleton crew on duty over the holiday . Tracy killed 71 people , caused A $ 837 million in damage ( 1974 dollars ) , or approximately A $ 6.85 billion ( 2018 dollars ) , or $ 4.79 billion 2018 USD . It destroyed more than 70 percent of Darwin 's buildings , including 80 percent of houses . It left more than 25,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless prior to landfall and required the evacuation of over 30,000 people , of whom many never returned . After the storm passed , the city was rebuilt using more stringent standards to cyclone code .",

The schooner was renamed Argosy Lemal in 1920 and carried that name until 1949 . As Argosy Lemal the ship served as one of the early United States Army communications ships from 1942-1949 . In 1949 , on return to civilian use , the vessel was renamed Ametco , Clair Crouch and finally Booya in 1964 . Booya was last seen anchored off Fort Hill wharf in Darwin Harbour at about 8.00pm on 24 December 1974 , the evening Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin . Nearly twenty-nine years later , in October 2003 , she was discovered by chance in Darwin Harbour , lying on her starboard side in about 20 metres of water .",
  "/wiki/Schooner": "A schooner is a type of sailing ship , as defined by its rig configuration . Typically it has two or more masts , the foremast being slightly shorter than the mainmast . Pronounced /\u02c8sku\u02d0n\u0259r/ , the term first appeared in eastern North America in the early 1700s . The name may be related to a Scots language word meaning to skip over water , or to skip stones .",

  "/wiki/MV_British_Motorist_(1924)": "MV British Motorist was a 6,891 ton tanker , built by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson , Newcastle upon Tyne in 1924 for the British Tanker Company . While under charter to the merchant navy , she was in port in Darwin , Australia when on 19 February 1942 , she was hit by two bombs during the Japanese air raid on Darwin and was sunk , resting in 18-20 metres ( 59-66 ft ) of water . She had been carrying oil , aviation fuel and petrol and was refuelling USS Peary when the raid commenced . Two of her crew were killed out of 61 in the initial attack : the master Gilbert C. Bates and 2nd Radio Operator James H. Webster . In 1959-1960 , she was salvaged by Fujita Salvage Company , with the fore and aft sections of the hull welded together while the engine room was left , as it was too heavy to refloat . The welded fore and aft was towed back to Japan and broken up .

  "/wiki/Bombing_of_Darwin": "The Bombing of Darwin , also known as the Battle of Darwin , on 19 February 1942 was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia . On that day , 242 Japanese aircraft , in two separate raids , attacked the town , ships in Darwin 's harbour and the town 's two airfields in an attempt to prevent the Allies from using them as bases to contest the invasion of Timor and Java during World War II . Darwin was lightly defended relative to the size of the attack , and the Japanese inflicted heavy losses upon Allied forces at little cost to themselves . The urban areas of Darwin also suffered some damage from the raids and there were a number of civilian casualties . More than half of Darwin 's civilian population left the area permanently , before or immediately after the attack . The two Japanese air raids were the first , and largest , of more than 100 air raids against Australia during 1942-43 .",

Hankow was towed to Darwin , Northern Territory in August 1932 and was used as a target outside Darwin Harbour and sunk by gunfire from HMAS Albatross on 18 September .",
  "/wiki/Hulk_(ship)": "A hulk is a ship that is afloat , but incapable of going to sea . Although sometimes used to describe a ship that has been launched but not completed , the term most often refers to an old ship that has had its rigging or internal equipment removed , retaining only its buoyant qualities . The word hulk is also used as a verb : a ship is hulked to convert it to a hulk . The verb was also applied to crews of Royal Navy ships in dock , who were sent to the receiving ship for accommodation , or hulked . Hulks have a variety of uses such as housing , prisons , salvage pontoons , gambling sites , naval training , or cargo storage . Although the term hulk can be used to refer to an abandoned wreck or shell , it is much more commonly applied to hulls that are still performing a useful function . In the days of sail , many hulls served longer as hulks than they did as functional ships . Wooden ships were often hulked when the hull structure became too old and weak to withstand the stresses of sailing . More recently , ships have been hulked when they become obsolete or when they become uneconomical to operate .",
  "/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory": "Darwin ( /\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0rw\u026an/ ( listen ) DAR-win ) is the capital city of the Northern Territory of Australia , situated on the Timor Sea . It is the largest city in the sparsely populated Northern Territory , with a population of 148,564 . It is the smallest , wettest and most northerly of the Australian capital cities , and acts as the Top End 's regional centre . Darwin 's proximity to South East Asia makes it a link between Australia and countries such as Indonesia and East Timor . The Stuart Highway begins in Darwin , extends southerly across central Australia through Tennant Creek and Alice Springs , concluding in Port Augusta , South Australia . The city is built upon a low bluff overlooking the harbour . Its suburbs begin at Lee Point in the north and stretch to Berrimah in the east . Past Berrimah , the Stuart Highway goes on to Darwin 's satellite city Palmerston and its suburbs . The Darwin region , like much of the Top End , experiences a tropical climate with a wet and dry season . A period known locally as the build up leading up to Darwin 's wet season sees temperature and humidity increase . Darwin 's wet season typically arrives in late November to early December and brings with it heavy monsoonal downpours , spectacular lightning displays , and increased cyclone activity . During the dry season , the city has clear skies and mild sea breezes from the harbour .",

  "/wiki/Submarine": "A submarine ( or sub ) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater . It differs from a submersible , which has more limited underwater capability . It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots , as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels , such as the midget submarine and the wet sub . Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes . In modern submarines , this structure is the sail in American usage and fin in European usage .",

  "/wiki/Sailing_ship": "A sailing ship uses sails , mounted on two or more masts , to harness the power of wind and propel the vessel . There is a variety of sail plans that propel sailing ships , employing square-rigged or fore-and-aft sails . Some ships carry square sails on each mast - the brig and full-rigged ship , said to be ship-rigged when there are three or more masts . Others carry only fore-and-aft sails on each mast - schooners . Still others employ a combination of square and fore-and aft sails , including the barque , barquentine , and brigantine . Sailing ships developed differently in Asia , which produced the junk and dhow - vessels that incorporated innovations absent in European ships of the time . Sailing ships with predominantly square rigs became prevalent during the Age of Discovery , when they crossed oceans between continents and around the world . Most sailing ships were merchantmen , but the Age of Sail also saw the development of large fleets of well-armed warships . The Age of Sail waned with the advent of steam-powered ships , which permitted more reliable water transport .",

  "/wiki/Cutter_(boat)": "A cutter is generally a small to medium-sized vessel , depending on its role and definition . Historically , it was a smallish single- or double-masted , decked sailcraft designed for speed rather than capacity . As such , it was gaff-rigged , with two or more headsails and often a bowsprit of some length , with a mast sometimes set farther back than on a sloop . While historically a workboat , as used by harbor pilots , the military , and privateers , sailing cutters today are most commonly fore-and-aft rigged private yachts . Powered cutters vary in size depending on their function , with small boats for ferrying passengers between larger craft and shore sometimes referred to as cutters , rugged smallish vessels serving the traditional role of delivering harbor pilots , and large ocean-going U.S. Coast Guard or UK Border Force ships referred to as cutters by tradition . Open oared cutters were carried aboard 18th century naval vessels and rowed by pairs of men sitting side-by-side on benches . A similar form that evolved among London watermen remains in use today in club racing .",

  "/wiki/SS_Mauna_Loa": "SS Mauna Loa was a steam-powered cargo ship of Matson Navigation Company that was sunk in the bombing of Darwin in February 1942 . She was christened SS West Conob in 1919 and renamed SS Golden Eagle in 1928 . At the time of her completion in 1919 , the ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Conob ( ID-4033 ) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned . West Conob was built in 1919 for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) , part of the West series of ships - steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort - and was the 14th ship built at Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company in San Pedro , California . She initially sailed for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and circumnavigated the globe twice by 1921 . She began sailing to South America for Swayne & Hoyt Lines in 1925 , and then , to Australia and New Zealand . When Swayne & Hoyt 's operation was taken over by the Oceanic and Oriental Navigation Company a few years later , she sailed under the name Golden Eagle until 1934 , when she was taken over by the Matson Navigation Company for service between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland and renamed Mauna Loa , after the large shield volcano on the Island of Hawaii . Shortly before the United States ' entry into World War II , Mauna Loa was chartered by the United States Department of War to carry supplies to the Philippines . The ship was part of an aborted attempt to reinforce Allied forces under attack by the Japanese on Timor in mid-February 1942 . After the return of her convoy to Darwin , Northern Territory , Mauna Loa was one of eight ships sunk in Darwin Harbour in the first Japanese bombing attack on the Australian mainland on 19 February .

It was requisitioned by the RAN , and was renamed and commissioned for service at Darwin as the channel patrol boat HMAS Mavie , on 31 December 1941 . Mavie was attacked by Japanese aircraft in the air raids on Darwin on 19 February 1942 , near the Stokes Hill Wharf in Darwin Harbour . Mavie was sunk by a near miss , although the crew of four survived . Mavie was salvaged in 1959-60 when the Fujita Salvage Company salvaged the cargo ship Neptuna , which had also been sunk in the raid .

  "/wiki/Auxiliary_ship": "An auxiliary ship is a naval ship designed to operate in support of combatant ships and other naval operations . Auxiliaries are not primary combatants , although they may have some limited combat capacity , usually of a self-defence nature . Auxiliaries are extremely important for navies of all sizes , as without them , the primary fleet vessels can not be effective . Thus , nearly every navy maintains an extensive fleet of auxiliaries . However , the composition and size of these auxiliary fleets varies depending on the nature of each navy and its primary mission . Smaller coastal navies tend to have smaller auxiliary vessels focusing primarily on littoral and training support roles . Larger blue-water navies tend to have large auxiliary fleets comprising longer-range fleet support vessels designed to provide support far beyond territorial waters .",

  "/wiki/Clemson-class_destroyer": "The Clemson class was a series of 156 destroyers which served with the United States Navy from after World War I through World War II . The Clemson-class ships were commissioned by the United States Navy from 1919 to 1922 , built by Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company , New York Shipbuilding Corporation , William Cramp & Sons , Bethlehem Steel Corporation , Mare Island Naval Shipyard , Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Bath Iron Works , some quite rapidly . The Clemson class was a minor redesign of the Wickes class for greater fuel capacity and was the last pre-World War II class of flush-deck destroyers to be built for the United States . Until the Fletcher-class destroyer , the Clemsons were the most numerous class of destroyers commissioned in the United States Navy and were known colloquially as flush-deckers , four-stackers or four-pipers .",
  "/wiki/Destroyer": "In naval terminology , a destroyer is a fast , maneuverable , long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet , convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers . They were originally developed in the late 19th century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats , and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 , these torpedo boat destroyers ( TBDs ) were large , swift , and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats . Although the term destroyer had been used interchangeably with TBD and torpedo boat destroyer by navies since 1892 , the term torpedo boat destroyer had been generally shortened to simply destroyer by nearly all navies by the First World War . Before World War II , destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations ; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together . After the war , the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers . This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation . At the start of the 21st century , destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships , with only two nations ( United States and Russia ) operating the heavier class cruisers , with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining . Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era , and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . At 510 feet ( 160 m ) long , a displacement of 9,200 tons , and with armament of more than 90 missiles , guided missile destroyers such as the Arleigh Burke-class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers . Some European navies , such as the French , Spanish , Dutch or German , use the term frigate for their destroyers , which leads to some confusion . After the Second World War , destroyers grew in size . The Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer had a displacement of 2200 tons , while the Arleigh Burke class has a displacement of up to 9600 tons , thus growing in size almost 340% .",
