  "/wiki/Borax": "Borax , also known as sodium borate , sodium tetraborate , or disodium tetraborate , is an important boron compound , a mineral , and a salt of boric acid . Powdered borax is white , consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve in water . A number of closely related minerals or chemical compounds that differ in their crystal water content are referred to as borax , and the word is usually used to refer to the octahydrate . Commercially sold borax is partially dehydrated . Borax is a component of many detergents , cosmetics , and enamel glazes . It is used to make buffer solutions in biochemistry , as a fire retardant , as an anti-fungal compound , in the manufacture of fiberglass , as a flux in metallurgy , neutron-capture shields for radioactive sources , a texturing agent in cooking , as a cross-linking agent in slime , as an alkali in photographic developers , as a precursor for other boron compounds , and along with its inverse , boric acid , is useful as an insecticide . In artisanal gold mining , borax is sometimes used as part of a process ( as a flux ) meant to eliminate the need for toxic mercury in the gold extraction process , although it can not directly replace mercury . Borax was reportedly used by gold miners in parts of the Philippines in the 1900s . Borax was first discovered in dry lake beds in Tibet and was imported via the Silk Road to the Arabian Peninsula in the 8th century AD . Borax first came into common use in the late 19th century when Francis Marion Smith 's Pacific Coast Borax Company began to market and popularize a large variety of applications under the 20 Mule Team Borax trademark , named for the method by which borax was originally hauled out of the California and Nevada deserts .",
  "/wiki/Monoclinic": "In crystallography , the monoclinic crystal system is one of the 7 crystal systems . A crystal system is described by three vectors . In the monoclinic system , the crystal is described by vectors of unequal lengths , as in the orthorhombic system . They form a rectangular prism with a parallelogram as its base . Hence two vectors are perpendicular ( meet at right angles ) , while the third vector meets the other two at an angle other than 90\u00b0 .",
  "/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate": "Magnesium sulfate is an inorganic salt with the formula MgSO4 ( H2O ) x where 0\u2264x\u22647 . It is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulphate mineral epsomite ( MgSO4\u00b77H2O ) , commonly called Epsom salt . The overall global annual usage in the mid-1970s of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons , of which the majority was used in agriculture . Epsom salt has been traditionally used as a component of bath salts . Epsom salt can also be used as a beauty product . Athletes use it to soothe sore muscles , while gardeners use it to improve crops . It has a variety of other uses : for example , Epsom salt is also effective in the removal of splinters .",
  "/wiki/Mica": "The mica group of sheet silicate ( phyllosilicate ) minerals includes several closely related materials having nearly perfect basal cleavage . All are monoclinic , with a tendency towards pseudohexagonal crystals , and are similar in chemical composition . The nearly perfect cleavage , which is the most prominent characteristic of mica , is explained by the hexagonal sheet-like arrangement of its atoms . The word mica is derived from the Latin word mica , meaning a crumb , and probably influenced by micare , to glitter .",
  "/wiki/Biotite": "Biotite is a common group of phyllosilicate minerals within the mica group , with the approximate chemical formula K ( Mg , Fe ) 3AlSi3O10 ( F , OH ) 2 . It is primarily a solid-solution series between the iron-endmember annite , and the magnesium-endmember phlogopite ; more aluminous end-members include siderophyllite and eastonite . Biotite was regarded as a mineral species by the International Mineralogical Association until 1998 , when its status was changed to a mineral group . The term biotite is still used to describe unanalysed dark micas in the field . Biotite was named by J.F.L . Hausmann in 1847 in honor of the French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot , who performed early research into the many optical properties of mica . Members of the biotite group are sheet silicates . Iron , magnesium , aluminium , silicon , oxygen , and hydrogen form sheets that are weakly bound together by potassium ions . It is sometimes called iron mica because it is more iron-rich than phlogopite . It is also sometimes called black mica as opposed to white mica ( muscovite ) - both form in the same rocks , and in some instances side-by-side .",
  "/wiki/Muscovite": "Muscovite ( also known as common mica , isinglass , or potash mica ) is a hydrated phyllosilicate mineral of aluminium and potassium with formula KAl2 ( AlSi3O10 ) ( F , OH ) 2 , or ( KF ) 2 ( Al2O3 ) 3 ( SiO2 ) 6 ( H2O ) . It has a highly perfect basal cleavage yielding remarkably thin laminae ( sheets ) which are often highly elastic . Sheets of muscovite 5 meters \u00d7 3 meters ( 16.5 feet \u00d7 10 feet ) have been found in Nellore , India .",
  "/wiki/Olivine": "The mineral olivine ( /\u02c8\u0252l\u026a\u02ccvi\u02d0n/ ) is a magnesium iron silicate with the formula ( Mg2+ , Fe2+ ) 2SiO4 . Thus , it is a type of nesosilicate or orthosilicate . The primary component of the Earth 's upper mantle , it is a common mineral in Earth 's subsurface , but weathers quickly on the surface . The ratio of magnesium to iron varies between the two endmembers of the solid solution series : forsterite ( Mg-endmember : Mg2SiO4 ) and fayalite ( Fe-endmember : Fe2SiO4 ) . Compositions of olivine are commonly expressed as molar percentages of forsterite ( Fo ) and fayalite ( Fa ) ( e.g. , Fo70Fa30 ) . Forsterite 's melting temperature is unusually high at atmospheric pressure , almost 1,900 \u00b0C ( 3,450 \u00b0F ) , while fayalite 's is much lower - about 1,200 \u00b0C ( 2,190 \u00b0F ) . Melting temperature varies smoothly between the two endmembers , as do other properties . Olivine incorporates only minor amounts of elements other than oxygen ( O ) , silicon ( Si ) , magnesium ( Mg ) and iron ( Fe ) . Manganese ( Mn ) and nickel ( Ni ) commonly are the additional elements present in highest concentrations .",
  "/wiki/Orthorhombic": "In crystallography , the orthorhombic crystal system is one of the 7 crystal systems . Orthorhombic lattices result from stretching a cubic lattice along two of its orthogonal pairs by two different factors , resulting in a rectangular prism with a rectangular base ( a by b ) and height ( c ) , such that a , b , and c are distinct . All three bases intersect at 90\u00b0 angles , so the three lattice vectors remain mutually orthogonal .",

Its name is also applied to the class of compounds which have the same type of crystal structure as CaTiO3 ( XIIA2+VIB4+X2\u22123 ) , known as the perovskite structure . Many different cations can be embedded in this structure , allowing the development of diverse engineered materials .",
  "/wiki/Topaz": "Topaz is a silicate mineral of aluminium and fluorine with the chemical formula Al2SiO4 ( F , OH ) 2 . Topaz crystallizes in the orthorhombic system , and its crystals are mostly prismatic terminated by pyramidal and other faces . It is one of the hardest naturally occurring minerals ( Mohs hardness of 8 ) and is the hardest of any silicate mineral . This hardness combined with its usual transparency and variety of colors means that it has acquired wide use in jewellery as a cut gemstone as well as for intaglios and other gemstone carvings .",
  "/wiki/Ulexite": "Ulexite ( NaCaB5O6 ( OH ) 6\u00b75H2O , hydrated sodium calcium borate hydroxide ) , sometimes known as TV rock , is a mineral occurring in silky white rounded crystalline masses or in parallel fibers . The natural fibers of ulexite conduct light along their long axes , by internal reflection . Ulexite was named for the German chemist Georg Ludwig Ulex ( 1811-1883 ) who first discovered it . Ulexite is a structurally complex mineral , with a basic structure containing chains of sodium , water and hydroxide octahedra . The chains are linked together by calcium , water , hydroxide and oxygen polyhedra and massive boron units . The boron units have a formula of [ B5O6 ( OH ) 6 ] 3- and a charge of \u22123 . They are composed of three borate tetrahedra and two borate triangular groups . Ulexite is found in evaporite deposits and the precipitated ulexite commonly forms a cotton ball tuft of acicular crystals . Ulexite is frequently found associated with colemanite , borax , meyerhofferite , hydroboracite , probertite , glauberite , trona , mirabilite , calcite , gypsum and halite . It is found principally in California and Nevada , US ; Tarapac\u00e1 Region in Chile , and Kazakhstan . Ulexite is also found in a vein-like bedding habit composed of closely packed fibrous crystals . Ulexite is also known as TV rock due to its unusual optical characteristics .",
