As of the 2016 census , Regina had a city population of 215,106 , and a Metropolitan Area population of 236,481 . It is governed by Regina City Council . The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No . 159 . Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories , of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part , and of the District of Assiniboia . The site was previously called Wascana ( Buffalo Bones in Cree ) , but was renamed to Regina ( Latin for Queen ) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria . This decision was made by Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Louise , who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada , the Marquess of Lorne . Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek . Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre ( 850 ft ) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake . Regina 's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906 .",

The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province .

Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

  "/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War": "The Spanish Civil War ( Spanish : Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola ) [ note 2 ] was a civil war in Spain fought from 1936 to 1939 . Republicans loyal to the left-leaning Second Spanish Republic , in alliance with anarchists and communists , fought against a revolt by the Nationalists , an alliance of Falangists , monarchists , conservatives and Catholics , led by a military group among whom General Francisco Franco soon achieved a preponderant role . Due to the international political climate at the time , the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle , a war of religion , a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy , between revolution and counterrevolution , and between fascism and communism . It has been frequently called the dress rehearsal for World War II . The Nationalists won the war , which ended in early 1939 , and ruled Spain until Franco 's death in November 1975 . The war began after a pronunciamiento ( a declaration of military opposition ) against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces , originally under the leadership of Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo . The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans , supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties , under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Aza\u00f1a . The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups , including CEDA , monarchists , including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists , and the FE de las JONS , a fascist political party . After the deaths of Sanjurjo , Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis , Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side . The coup was supported by military units in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco , Pamplona , Burgos , Zaragoza , Valladolid , C\u00e1diz , C\u00f3rdoba , and Seville . However , rebelling units in some important cities - such as Madrid , Barcelona , Valencia , Bilbao , and M\u00e1laga - did not gain control , and those cities remained under the control of the government .
