  "/wiki/Apple_II": "The Apple II ( stylized as apple ] [ ) is an 8-bit home computer and one of the world 's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products , designed primarily by Steve Wozniak ( Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II 's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply ) . It was introduced by Jobs and Wozniak at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer , Inc . It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until Apple IIe production ceased in November 1993 . The Apple II marks Apple 's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer market - branded toward American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists .",

  "/wiki/Mockingboard": "The Mockingboard ( a pun on Mockingbird ) is a sound card for the Apple II family of microcomputers built by Sweet Micro Systems , which improve on the Apple II 's limited sound capabilities . In 1981 , Sweet Micro Systems began designing products not only for creating music , but speech and general sound effects as well , culminating in the release of the Mockingboard in 1983 . The Mockingboard 's hardware allowed programmers to create complex , high-quality sound without need for constant CPU attention . The Mockingboard could be connected to the Apple 's built-in speaker or to external speakers . However , as the quality of the built-in speaker was not high , the instruction manual recommended obtaining external speakers . The Mockingboard was available in various models for either the slot-based Apple II / Apple II Plus / Apple IIe systems or in one special model for the Apple IIc . Sound was generated through one or more AY-3-8910 or compatible sound chips , with one chip offering three square-wave synthesis channels . The boards could also be equipped with an optional speech chip ( a Votrax SC-01 or compatible ) . Some software products supported more than one Mockingboard . Ultima V supported two boards , for a total of 12 voices , of which it used eight . Most other programs supported at most one board with six voices . Applied Engineering 's Phasor was compatible with the Mockingboard .",
  "/wiki/Atari_800": "The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari , Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992 . All of the machines in the family are technically similar and differ primarily in packaging . They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz , [ a ] and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips . This architecture enabled graphics and sound capabilities more advanced than most contemporary machines , and gaming on the platform was a major draw . The first-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform 's killer app . The systems launched with a series of plug and play peripherals that used the Atari SIO serial bus system , an early analog of USB . [ b ] To meet stringent FCC requirements , much of the circuitry of the original machines is enclosed in a cast aluminum block , which made them physically robust but expensive to produce . The 400 and 800 were replaced by the XL series in 1983 , then-after the company was sold and reestablished as Atari Corporation-the XE models in 1985 . The XL and XE are lighter in construction and less expensive to build , while also having Atari BASIC built-in and reducing the number of joystick ports from 4 to 2 . The 130XE , released in 1985 , increased the memory to 128K of bank-switched RAM . The Atari 8-bit computer line sold two million units during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985 . They were not only sold through dedicated computer retailers , but department stores such as Sears , using an in-store demo to attract customers .",
  "/wiki/MOS_Technologies_6502": "The MOS Technology 6502 ( typically sixty-five-oh-two or six-five-oh-two ) is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology . When it was introduced in 1975 , the 6502 was , by a considerable margin , the least expensive microprocessor on the market . It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies , such as Motorola and Intel . Its introduction caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market . Along with the Zilog Z80 , it sparked a series of projects that resulted in the home computer revolution of the early 1980s . Popular home video game consoles and computers , such as the Atari 2600 , Atari 8-bit family , Apple II , Nintendo Entertainment System , Commodore 64 , Atari Lynx , BBC Micro and others , used the 6502 or variations of the basic design . Soon after the 6502 's introduction , MOS Technology was purchased outright by Commodore International , who continued to sell the microprocessor and licenses to other manufacturers . In the early days of the 6502 , it was second-sourced by Rockwell and Synertek , and later licensed to other companies . In its CMOS form , which was developed by the Western Design Center ( WDC ) , the 6502 family continues to be widely used in embedded systems , with estimated production volumes in the hundreds of millions .",
  "/wiki/Commodore_64": "The Commodore 64 , also known as the C64 or the CBM 64 , is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International ( first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , January 7-10 , 1982 ) . It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time , with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units . Volume production started in early 1982 , marketing in August for US $ 595 ( equivalent to $ 1,576 in 2019 ) . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET , the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes ( 65,536 bytes ) of RAM . With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",
  "/wiki/IBM_PC": "The IBM Personal Computer , commonly known as the IBM PC , is the original version of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform . It is IBM model number 5150 and was introduced on August 12 , 1981 . It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Philip Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton , Florida . The generic term personal computer ( PC ) was in use years before 1981 , applied as early as 1972 to the Xerox PARC 's Alto , but the term PC came to mean more specifically a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM 's Personal Computer branded products . The machine was based on open architecture , and third-party suppliers sprang up to provide peripheral devices , expansion cards , and software . IBM had a substantial influence on the personal computer market in standardizing a platform for personal computers , and IBM compatible became an important criterion for sales growth . Only the Apple Macintosh family kept a significant share of the microcomputer market after the 1980s without compatibility to the IBM personal computer .",
  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",
  "/wiki/Atari_ST": "The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family . The initial ST model , the 520ST , saw limited release in April-June 1985 and was widely available in July . The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bitmapped color GUI , using a version of Digital Research 's GEM released in February 1985 . The 1040ST , released in 1986 , is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US $ 1 . The Atari ST is part of a mid-1980s generation of home computers that have 16 or 32-bit processors , 256 KB or more of RAM , and mouse-controlled graphical user interfaces . This generation includes the Macintosh , Commodore Amiga , Apple IIGS , and , the most advanced true 32bit Acorn Archimedes . ST officially stands for Sixteen/Thirty-two , which refers to the Motorola 68000 's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals . The ST was sold with either Atari 's color monitor or the less expensive monochrome monitor . The system 's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest-resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor . In some markets , particularly Germany , the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and desktop publishing work . Thanks to its built-in MIDI ports , the ST enjoyed success for running music sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among amateurs and well-known musicians alike . The ST was superseded by the Atari STE , Atari TT , Atari MEGA STE , and Falcon computers .",
  "/wiki/Apple_Macintosh": "The Macintosh ( mainly Mac since 1998 ) is a family of personal computers designed , manufactured , and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984 . The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface , built-in screen , and mouse . Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993 . Early Macintosh models were expensive , hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper Commodore 64 for consumers , as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses . Although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac . Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing , making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade . In the early 1990s , Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time . However , the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel 's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks , gradually took market share from Apple , and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer . Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s , the falling prices of commodity PC components , poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa , and the release of Windows 95 contributed to some decline of the Macintosh user base . Upon his return , Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 ( including models made for specific regions ) down to four in mid-1999 : the Power Macintosh G3 , iMac , 14.1 PowerBook G3 , and 12 iBook . All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance , competitive prices and aesthetic designs , and helped return Apple to profitability . Around this time , Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of Mac , a nickname that had been in common use since the development of the first model .",

It is a stripped-down version of Fujitsu 's earlier FM-8 computer , and during development it was referred to as the FM-8 Jr . Although it was designed to be a cut-down version of the FM-8 , most notably removing the ( expensive ) bubble memory technology , the FM-7 was given a more advanced AY-3-8910 sound chip capable of three voice sound synthesis , leading to a strong uptake among the hobbyist computer market in Japan and making it a more popular system than the FM-8 . The FM-7 primarily competed with the NEC PC-8801 and Sharp X1 series of computers in the early 1980s . It was succeeded by the FM-77 series of computers in 1984 , which featured backwards compatibility with the FM-7 . The FM-77 series was later succeeded by the 32-bit FM Towns in 1989 .

  "/wiki/Fujisankei_Communications_International": "Fujisankei Communications International , Inc. ( FCI ) is the American arm of the Fujisankei Communications Group , a Japanese media conglomerate of television and radio channels , magazine , newspaper , record and video game companies . The Fujisankei Communications Group regroups more than 90 companies , like Fuji TV in Japan , among others . Founded in 1986 in New York City and owned by Fuji Media Holdings , FCI makes productions from the Fujisankei Communications Group available to the United States and the rest of the western world . FCI was involved with videogame publishing as well , being one of the early third-party licensees for Nintendo 's NES system . Originally , FCI merely published in North America translations of video games that were released in Japan mainly by Pony Canyon , another company from the Fujisankei Communications Group . FCI was well-known at this time for the many RPG and Adventure games they released for the NES as conversions from PC games , such as the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons and Ultima series . Later , FCI began contracting outside development houses to create original games ; examples include WCW Super Brawl Wrestling and WCW : The Main Event , both developed by Beam Software of Australia ; Might & Magic III , developed by Iguana Entertainment ; and Metal Morph and the Runes of Virtue titles in the Ultima series , both developed by Origin Systems . FCI had a long partnership with Origin , starting when Pony Canyon was hired to translate the Ultima PC games for Japan , strengthening through the conversion of Ultima III through Ultima VII for the NES and SNES by Pony Canyon/FCI , and continuing through the end of FCI 's videogame department ; a conversion of Origin 's PC game Wing Commander II to the SNES was in development for release by FCI when they closed their video games division . In the mid-1990s , FCI abandoned video game distribution to concentrate on television operations . FCI has contracts with television stations in New York City , Hawaii and California to air programming segments . Since 1999 , Fuji TV , through FCI , has forbidden foreign TV stations from subtitling its dramas , a practice that is criticized and has alienated some fans of the genre .
