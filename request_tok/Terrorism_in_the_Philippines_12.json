According to the 2015 census , it has a population of 112,788 people . It is also colloquially known as Isabela de Basilan to differentiate the city 's name from the province of Isabela in Luzon . While administratively the island province of Basilan is part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ( BARMM ) , Isabela City , where it served as its capital since the province 's creation , itself is not part of this region , being instead placed under the Zamboanga Peninsula region . Isabela is still being regulated by the Basilan provincial government and provincial services are provided by Basilan but regional services are being provided by Zamboanga Peninsula . The Philippine Statistics Authority lists Isabela as statistically independent from Basilan . This prompted the provincial government to transfer the capital to Lamitan City . Institutionally , the military has played a major part in Isabela City 's and Basilan 's volatile history , due to the ongoing conflicts borne out of the Moro Secessionist wars of the 1970s , and more recently , by Al Qaeda backed Islamic fundamentalist groups fomenting a running gun-battle with the Philippines ' armed forces for more than a decade . Also exerting great influence in everyday life is the Roman Catholic Church and the Islamic mufti and imams , religious scholars and leaders who exercise a moral ascendancy over their respective groups . Trading and commerce are still predominantly in the hands of the East Asian ( Hokkien Chinese ) , aided more so by a recent influx of immigrants from Taiwan and by Koreans as well .",

  "/wiki/Cathedral": "A cathedral is a church that contains the cathedra ( Latin for seat ) of a bishop , thus serving as the central church of a diocese , conference , or episcopate . Churches with the function of cathedral are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy , such as the Catholic , Anglican , Eastern Orthodox , and some Lutheran churches . Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appeared in Italy , Gaul , Spain and North Africa in the 4th century , but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century , by which time they had developed architectural forms , institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches , monastic churches and episcopal residences . Following the Protestant Reformation , the Christian church in several parts of Western Europe , such as Scotland , the Netherlands , certain Swiss Cantons and parts of Germany , adopted a Presbyterian polity that did away with bishops altogether . Where ancient cathedral buildings in these lands are still in use for congregational worship , they generally retain the title and dignity of cathedral , maintaining and developing distinct cathedral functions , but void of hierarchical supremacy . From the 16th century onwards , but especially since the 19th century , churches originating in Western Europe have undertaken vigorous programmes of missionary activity , leading to the founding of large numbers of new dioceses with associated cathedral establishments of varying forms in Asia , Africa , Australasia , Oceania and the Americas . In addition , both the Catholic Church and Orthodox churches have formed new dioceses within formerly Protestant lands for converts and migrant co-religionists . Consequently , it is not uncommon to find Christians in a single city being served by three or more cathedrals of differing denominations .",

They also said , there 's no religious conflict in the south and we 're fighting for our right of self-determination . A press secretary to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo expressed confidence that the bombing would not collapse peace negotiations between the government and the MILF . Several members of the opposition said that these attacks may be related to a possible plan by the government to place the country in emergency rule , alluding to the days of Martial Law under former president Ferdinand Marcos . Others have said they may be in preparation to heighten security amid the State of the Nation Address by Arroyo , which may restrict demonstrations and protest . The government rejected these claims and said they were assessing the situation .
