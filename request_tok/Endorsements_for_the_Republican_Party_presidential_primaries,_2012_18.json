After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic .

Later in 2004 , shortly after the outing of Scheuer 's harsh criticism of America 's close alliance with Israel , Scheuer resigned from his position at the CIA . In his book Scheuer depicted bin Laden as a rational actor who was fighting to weaken the United States by weakening its economy , rather than merely combating and killing Americans . Scheuer challenges the common assumption that terrorism is the threat facing the United States in the modern era , arguing rather that Islamist insurgency ( and not terrorism ) is the core of the conflict between the U.S. and Islamist forces , who in places such as Kashmir , Xinjiang , and Chechnya are struggling not just for independence but against institutionalized barbarism . Osama bin Laden acknowledged the book in a 2007 statement , suggesting that it revealed the reasons for your losing the war against us . In February 2009 , Scheuer reported that , as a consequence of his statements about US foreign policy towards Israel , he had been fired from his position as a senior fellow of the Jamestown Foundation by Jamestown 's president .
