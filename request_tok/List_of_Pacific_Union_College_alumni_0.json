[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance": "The Harlem Renaissance was an intellectual , social , and artistic explosion centered in Harlem , Manhattan , New York City , spanning the 1920s . At the time , it was known as the New Negro Movement , named after The New Negro , a 1925 anthology edited by Alain Locke . The movement also included the new African-American cultural expressions across the urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest United States affected by the Great Migration , of which Harlem was the largest . Though it was centered in the Harlem neighborhood , many francophone black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the movement , which spanned from about 1918 until the mid-1930s . Many of its ideas lived on much longer . The zenith of this flowering of Negro literature , as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance , took place between 1924 - when Opportunity : A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance - and 1929 , the year of the stock-market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression . The Harlem Renaissance is considered to have been a rebirth of the African-American arts .",

  "/wiki/Television": "Television ( TV ) , sometimes shortened to tele or telly , is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome ( black and white ) , or in colour , and in two or three dimensions and sound . The term can refer to a television set , a television program ( TV show ) , or the medium of television transmission . Television is a mass medium for advertising , entertainment and news . Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s , but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers . After World War II , an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain , and television sets became commonplace in homes , businesses , and institutions . During the 1950s , television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion . In the mid-1960s , color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries . The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes , high-capacity hard disk drives , DVDs , flash drives , high-definition Blu-ray Discs , and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material - such as movies - at home on their own time schedule . For many reasons , especially the convenience of remote retrieval , the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud . At the end of the first decade of the 2000s , digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity . Another development was the move from standard-definition television ( SDTV ) ( 576i , with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i ) to high-definition television ( HDTV ) , which provides a resolution that is substantially higher . HDTV may be transmitted in various formats : 1080p , 1080i and 720p .",

  "/wiki/Creation_science": "Creation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism , presented without obvious Biblical language but with the claim that special creation and flood geology based on the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis have validity as science . Creationists also claim it disproves or reexplains a variety of scientific facts , theories and paradigms of geology , cosmology , biological evolution , archaeology , history , and linguistics . However , the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that creation science fails to qualify as scientific because it lacks empirical support , supplies no tentative hypotheses , and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes . Courts , most often in the United States where the question has been asked in the context of teaching the subject in public schools , have consistently ruled since the 1980s that creation science is a religious view rather than a scientific one . Historians , philosophers of science and skeptics describe creation science as a pseudoscientific attempt to map the Bible into scientific facts . Professional biologists have criticized creation science for being unscholarly , and even as a dishonest and misguided sham , with extremely harmful educational consequences . Creation science began in the 1960s , as a fundamentalist Christian effort in the United States to prove Biblical inerrancy and nullify the scientific evidence for evolution . [ page needed ] It has since developed a sizable religious following in the United States , with creation science ministries branching worldwide . The main ideas in creation science are : the belief in creation ex nihilo ( Latin : out of nothing ) ; the conviction that the Earth was created within the last 6,000-10,000 years ; the belief that humans and other life on Earth were created as distinct fixed baraminological kinds ; and the idea that fossils found in geological strata were deposited during a cataclysmic flood which completely covered the entire Earth . As a result , creation science also challenges the commonly accepted geologic and astrophysical theories for the age and origins of the Earth and universe , which creationists believe are irreconcilable with the account in the Book of Genesis . [ page needed ] Creation science proponents often refer to the theory of evolution as Darwinism or as Darwinian evolution . The creation science texts and curricula that first emerged in the 1960s focused upon concepts derived from a literal interpretation of the Bible and were overtly religious in nature , most notably linking Noah 's flood in the Biblical Genesis account to the geological and fossil record .",

The analogous Greek term is \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 ( hupokrit\u1e17s ) , literally one who answers . The actor 's interpretation of their role - the art of acting - pertains to the role played , whether based on a real person or fictional character . Interpretation occurs even when the actor is playing themselves , as in some forms of experimental performance art . Formerly , in ancient Greece and Rome , the medieval world , and the time of William Shakespeare , only men could become actors , and women 's roles were generally played by men or boys . After the English Restoration of 1660 , women began to appear on stage in England . In modern times , particularly in pantomime and some operas , women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men .",

The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the mid-19th century and it was formally established in 1863 . Among its founders was Ellen G. White , whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by the church . Much of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church corresponds to common Protestant Christian teachings , such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture . Distinctive teachings include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment . The church is known for its emphasis on diet and health , its holistic understanding of the person , its promotion of religious liberty , and its conservative principles and lifestyle . The world church is governed by a General Conference , with smaller regions administered by divisions , union conferences , and local conferences . It currently has a worldwide baptized membership of over 20 million people , and 25 million adherents .

  "/wiki/Professor": "Professor ( commonly abbreviated as Prof. ) is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries . Literally , professor derives from Latin as a person who professes . Professors are usually experts in their field and teachers of the highest rank . In many systems of academic ranks , professor refers only to the most senior academic position , sometimes informally known as full professor . In some countries and institutions , the word professor is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor ; this is particularly the case in the United States . This colloquial usage would be considered incorrect among other academic communities . However , the unqualified title Professor designated with a capital letter nearly always refers to a full professor . Professors often conduct original research and commonly teach undergraduate , professional , or postgraduate courses in their fields of expertise . In universities with graduate schools , professors may mentor and supervise graduate students conducting research for a thesis or dissertation . In many universities , full professors take on senior managerial roles such as leading departments , research teams and institutes , and filling roles such as president , principal or vice-chancellor . The role of professor may be more public-facing than that of more junior staff , and professors are expected to be national or international leaders in their field of expertise .",

  "/wiki/Theologian": "As defined by Scholasticism , theology is constituted by a triple aspect : what is taught by God , teaches of God and leads to God ( Latin : Theologia a Deo docetur , Deum docet , et ad Deum ducit ) . This indicates the three distinct areas of God as theophanic revelation , the systematic study of the nature of divine and , more generally , of religious belief , and the spiritual path . Theology is taught as an academic discipline , typically in universities and seminaries . It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural , but also deals with religious epistemology , asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation . Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God , gods , or deities , as not only transcendent or above the natural world , but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and , in particular , to reveal themselves to humankind . While theology has turned into a secular field , religious adherents still consider theology to be a discipline that helps them live and understand concepts such as life and love and that helps them lead lives of obedience to the deities they follow or worship .",

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) .

The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union .

The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits .

Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] .

  "/wiki/Fascism": "Fascism ( /\u02c8f\u00e6\u0283\u026az\u0259m/ ) is a form of far-right , authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power , forcible suppression of opposition , and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe . The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I , before spreading to other European countries . Opposed to liberalism , Marxism , and anarchism , fascism is placed on the far-right within the traditional left-right spectrum . Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war , society , the state , and technology . The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants . A military citizenship arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war . The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them , as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens . Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties . Such a state is led by a strong leader - such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party - to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society . Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views political violence , war and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation . Fascists advocate a mixed economy , with the principal goal of achieving autarky ( national economic self-sufficiency ) through protectionist and interventionist economic policies . Since the end of World War II in 1945 , few parties have openly described themselves as fascist , and the term is instead now usually used pejoratively by political opponents ."
