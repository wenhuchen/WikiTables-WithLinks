  "/wiki/Republic_of_Texas": "The Republic of Texas ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica de Tejas ) was a sovereign nation in North America that existed from October 2 , 1835 , to February 19 , 1846 . It was bordered by Mexico to the west and southwest , the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast , the two U.S. states of Louisiana and Arkansas to the east and northeast , and United States territories encompassing parts of the current U.S. states of Oklahoma , Kansas , Colorado , Wyoming , and New Mexico to the north and west . The citizens of the republic were known as Texians . The region of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas commonly referred to as Mexican Texas declared its independence from Mexico during the Texas Revolution in 1835-1836 . The Texas war of independence ended on April 21 , 1836 , but Mexico refused to recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas , and intermittent conflicts between the two states continued into the 1840s . The United States recognized the Republic of Texas in March 1837 but declined to annex the territory . The Republic-claimed borders were based upon the Treaties of Velasco between the newly created Texas Republic and Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna of Mexico . The eastern boundary had been defined by the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain , which recognised the Sabine River as the eastern boundary of Spanish Texas and western boundary of the Missouri Territory . Under the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 the United States had renounced its claim to Spanish land to the east of the Rocky Mountains and to the north of the Rio Grande , which it claimed to have acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . The republic 's southern and western boundary with Mexico was disputed throughout the republic 's existence . Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its southern boundary , while Mexico insisted that the Nueces River was the boundary . In practice , much of the disputed territory was occupied by the Comanche and outside the control of either state , but Texian claims included the eastern portions of New Mexico , which was administered by Mexico throughout this period .",
  "/wiki/Confederate_States_Army": "The Confederate States Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America ( commonly referred to as the Confederacy ) during the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , fighting against the United States forces . On February 28 , 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate president , Jefferson Davis . Davis was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy , and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican-American War . He had also been a United States Senator from Mississippi and U.S. Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce . On March 1 , 1861 , on behalf of the Confederate government , Davis assumed control of the military situation at Charleston , South Carolina , where South Carolina state militia besieged Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor , held by a small U.S. Army garrison . By March 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army . An accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records ; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men . This does not include an unknown number of slaves who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army , such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons . Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war , they do not represent the size of the army at any given date . These numbers do not include men who served in Confederate States Navy . Although most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers , both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription , primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer . In the absence of exact records , estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh": "The Battle of Shiloh ( also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing ) was a battle in the Western Theater of the American Civil War , fought April 6-7 , 1862 , in southwestern Tennessee . A Union force known as the Army of the Tennessee ( Major General Ulysses S. Grant ) had moved via the Tennessee River deep into Tennessee and was encamped principally at Pittsburg Landing on the west bank of the Tennessee River , where the Confederate Army of Mississippi ( General Albert Sidney Johnston , P. G. T. Beauregard second-in-command ) launched a surprise attack on Grant 's army from its base in Corinth , Mississippi . Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting ; Beauregard took command of the army and decided against pressing the attack late in the evening . Overnight , Grant was reinforced by one of his divisions stationed further north and was joined by three divisions from the Army of the Ohio ( Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell ) . The Union forces began an unexpected counterattack the next morning which reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day . On April 6 , the first day of the battle , the Confederates struck with the intention of driving the Union defenders away from the river and into the swamps of Owl Creek to the west . Johnston hoped to defeat Grant 's army before the anticipated arrival of Buell and the Army of the Ohio . The Confederate battle lines became confused during the fighting , and Grant 's men instead fell back to the northeast , in the direction of Pittsburg Landing . A Union position on a slightly sunken road , nicknamed the Hornet 's Nest and defended by the divisions of Brig . Gens . Benjamin Prentiss and William H. L. Wallace , provided time for the remainder of the Union line to stabilize under the protection of numerous artillery batteries . Wallace was mortally wounded when the position collapsed , while several regiments from the two divisions were eventually surrounded and surrendered .",

He commanded the Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War from 1862 until its surrender in 1865 . A son of Revolutionary War officer Henry Light Horse Harry Lee III , Lee was a top graduate of the United States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer in the United States Army for 32 years . During this time , he served throughout the United States , distinguished himself during the Mexican-American War , and served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy . He was also the husband of Mary Anna Custis Lee , adopted great granddaughter of George Washington . When Virginia 's 1861 Richmond Convention declared secession from the Union , Lee chose to follow his home state , despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command . During the first year of the Civil War , he served as a senior military adviser to Confederate President Jefferson Davis . Once he took command of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862 , he soon emerged as an able tactician and battlefield commander , winning most of his battles , nearly all against far larger Union armies . Lee 's two major strategic offensives into Union territory ended in defeat . His aggressive tactics , especially at the Battle of Gettysburg , which resulted in high casualties at a time when the Confederacy had a shortage of manpower , have come under criticism in recent years . Lee surrendered the remnant of his army to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 .

Established in 1749 , the university is a colonial-era college and the ninth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States . Washington and Lee 's 325-acre campus sits at the edge of Lexington and abuts the campus of the Virginia Military Institute in the Shenandoah Valley region between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Allegheny Mountains . The campus is approximately 50 miles ( 80 km ) northeast from Roanoke , 140 miles ( 230 km ) west from the state capital of Richmond , and 180 miles ( 290 km ) inland southwest from the national capital at Washington , D.C. Washington and Lee was originally founded as a small classical school named Augusta Academy ( later renamed Liberty Hall Academy ) by Scots-Irish Presbyterian pioneers , though the university has never claimed any sectarian affiliation . In 1796 , shortly before the end of his second term as US President , George Washington endowed the struggling academy with a gift of stock , one of the largest gifts to an educational institution at that time . In gratitude , the school was renamed for the commander of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , president at the Federal Constitutional Convention meeting in Philadelphia ( summer of 1787 ) , framer of the American Constitution ( 1787-1788 ) , and the first President of the United States ( 1789-1797 ) .

As a major general , he received recognition for delaying the advance of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan 's prodigiously large force , the Army of the Potomac , during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign , as well as recapturing Galveston , Texas the following year . When the Civil War began in 1861 , Magruder left the Union Army to accept a commission in the Confederacy . As commander of the Army of the Peninsula , he fortified the Virginia Peninsula and won the Battle of Big Bethel . In the Peninsula Campaign , he stalled McClellan 's Army of the Potomac outside Yorktown , allowing Maj. Gen. Joseph E.

It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas , which was not formally recognized by the Mexican government , who disputed the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican caudillo President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after the Texas Revolution a decade earlier . In 1845 , newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk , who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a further expansion of the United States , sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico . After Mexican forces attacked U.S. forces , the United States Congress declared war . U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of Alta California , and then moved south . Meanwhile , the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in the lower Baja California Territory . The U.S. Army , under Major General Winfield Scott , eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance , having marched west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast , where the U.S. staged its first ever major amphibious landing . The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , forced onto the remnant Mexican government , ended the war and enforced the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States . The U.S. agreed to pay $ 15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $ 3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens . Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the State of Texas and accepted the Rio Grande as its northern border with the United States . The victory and territorial expansion Polk envisioned inspired great patriotism in the United States , but the war and treaty drew some criticism in the U.S. for their casualties , monetary cost , and heavy-handedness , particularly early on . The question of how to treat the new acquisitions also intensified the debate over slavery .",

He served under Lee as a corps commander for most of the famous battles fought by the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern Theater , and briefly with Braxton Bragg in the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater . After graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point , Longstreet served in the Mexican-American War . He was wounded in the thigh at the Battle of Chapultepec , and afterward married his first wife , Louise Garland . Throughout the 1850s , he served on frontier duty in the American Southwest . In June 1861 , Longstreet resigned his U.S. Army commission and joined the Confederate Army . He commanded Confederate troops during an early victory at Blackburn 's Ford in July and played a minor role at the First Battle of Bull Run . Longstreet made significant contributions to several important Confederate victories , mostly in the Eastern Theater as one of Robert E. Lee 's chief subordinates in the Army of Northern Virginia . He performed poorly at Seven Pines by accidentally marching his men down the wrong road , causing them to be late in arrival , but played an important role in the success of the Seven Days Battles in the summer of 1862 . Longstreet led a devastating counterattack that routed the Union army at Second Bull Run in August . His men held their ground in defensive roles at Antietam and Fredericksburg . Longstreet 's most controversial service was at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 , where he openly disagreed with General Lee on the tactics to be employed and reluctantly supervised several unsuccessful attacks on Union forces , including the disastrous Pickett 's Charge .",

[ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country .

John Pope 's Army of Virginia , and a battle of much larger scale and numbers than the First Battle of Bull Run ( or First Manassas ) fought on July 21 , 1861 on the same ground . Following a wide-ranging flanking march , Confederate Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson captured the Union supply depot at Manassas Junction , threatening Pope 's line of communications with Washington , D.C . Withdrawing a few miles to the northwest , Jackson took up strong concealed defensive positions on Stony Ridge and awaited the arrival of the wing of Lee 's army commanded by Maj. Gen. James Longstreet . On August 28 , 1862 , Jackson attacked a Union column just east of Gainesville , at Brawner 's Farm , resulting in a stalemate but successfully getting Pope 's attention . On that same day , Longstreet broke through light Union resistance in the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap and approached the battlefield . Pope became convinced that he had trapped Jackson and concentrated the bulk of his army against him . On August 29 , Pope launched a series of assaults against Jackson 's position along an unfinished railroad grade . The attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides . At noon , Longstreet arrived on the field from Thoroughfare Gap and took position on Jackson 's right flank . On August 30 , Pope renewed his attacks , seemingly unaware that Longstreet was on the field . When massed Confederate artillery devastated a Union assault by Maj. Gen.

Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia and Union General George B. McClellan 's Army of the Potomac , near Sharpsburg , Maryland and Antietam Creek . Part of the Maryland Campaign , it was the first field army-level engagement in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War to take place on Union soil . It was the bloodiest day in United States military history , with a combined tally of 22,717 dead , wounded , or missing . After pursuing the Confederate general Robert E. Lee into Maryland , Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan of the Union Army launched attacks against Lee 's army , in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek . At dawn on September 17 , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee 's left flank . Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller 's Cornfield , and fighting swirled around the Dunker Church . Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center , but the Federal advantage was not followed up . In the afternoon , Union Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside 's corps entered the action , capturing a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and advancing against the Confederate right . At a crucial moment , Confederate Maj. Gen. A. P.

Both armies suffered heavy casualties , around 5,000 men killed in total , a harbinger of a bloody war of attrition by Grant against Lee 's army and , eventually , the Confederate capital , Richmond , Virginia . The battle was tactically inconclusive , as Grant disengaged and continued his offensive . Grant attempted to move quickly through the dense underbrush of the Wilderness of Spotsylvania , but Lee launched two of his corps on parallel roads to intercept him .

That afternoon the Third Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill , encountered Brig . Gen. George W. Getty 's division ( VI Corps ) and Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock 's II Corps on the Orange Plank Road . Fighting until dark was fierce but inconclusive as both sides attempted to maneuver in the dense woods . At dawn on May 6 , Hancock attacked along the Plank Road , driving Hill 's Corps back in confusion , but the First Corps of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet arrived in time to prevent the collapse of the Confederate right flank . Longstreet followed up with a surprise flanking attack from an unfinished railroad bed that drove Hancock 's men back to the Brock Road , but the momentum was lost when Longstreet was wounded by his own men .

Lee . Jackson played a prominent role in nearly all military engagements in the Eastern Theater of the war until his death , and played a key role in winning many significant battles . Born in what was then part of Virginia ( in present-day West Virginia ) , Jackson received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point , served in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 and distinguished himself at Chapultepec ( 1847 ) . From 1851 to 1863 he taught at the Virginia Military Institute , where he was unpopular with his students . During this time , he married twice . His first wife died giving birth , but his second wife , Mary Anna Morrison , lived until 1915 . When Virginia seceded from the Union in May 1861 after the attack on Fort Sumter ( April 12 , 1861 ) , Jackson joined the Confederate Army . He distinguished himself commanding a brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run ( July 21 , 1861 ) the following month , providing crucial reinforcements and beating back a fierce Union assault . In this context Barnard Elliott Bee Jr. compared him to a stone wall , hence his enduring nickname . Jackson performed well in the campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley during 1862 . Despite an initial defeat due largely to faulty intelligence , through swift and careful maneuvers Jackson was able to defeat three separate Union armies and prevent any of them from reinforcing General George B.

Yielding to political pressure , Brig . Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig . Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction . McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed ; nevertheless , the Confederates , who had been planning to attack the Union left flank , found themselves at an initial disadvantage . Confederate reinforcements under Brig . Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad , and the course of the battle quickly changed .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Chancellorsville": "The Battle of Chancellorsville was a major battle of the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , and the principal engagement of the Chancellorsville campaign . It was fought from April 30 to May 6 , 1863 , in Spotsylvania County , Virginia , near the village of Chancellorsville . Two related battles were fought nearby on May 3 in the vicinity of Fredericksburg . The campaign pitted Union Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size , General Robert E. Lee 's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia . Chancellorsville is known as Lee 's perfect battle because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory . The victory , a product of Lee 's audacity and Hooker 's timid decision-making , was tempered by heavy casualties , including Lt. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson . Jackson was hit by friendly fire , requiring his left arm to be amputated . He died of pneumonia eight days later , a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm . Lee 's difficulty in replacing his lost men as well as his inability to prevent the Union withdrawal effectively have led to his great victory being regarded as a Pyrrhic one . The Chancellorsville campaign began with the crossing of the Rappahannock River by the Union army on the morning of April 27 , 1863 . Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman began a long-distance raid against Lee 's supply lines at about the same time . This operation was completely ineffectual .",
  "/wiki/George_Pickett": "George Edward Pickett ( January 16 , 1825 - July 30 , 1875 ) was a career United States Army officer who became a major general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War . He is best remembered for leading Pickett 's Charge , the futile and bloody Confederate offensive on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg that bears his name . Pickett graduated last out of 59 cadets in the United States Military Academy class of 1846 . He served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army during the Mexican-American War and is noted for his service in the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847 . After this , he served in the Washington Territory and eventually reached the rank of captain . Pickett participated in the Pig War of 1859 . Near the beginning of the American Civil War , he commissioned in the Confederate States Army , and he attained the rank of brigadier general in January 1862 . He commanded a brigade that saw heavy action during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862 . Pickett was wounded at the Battle of Gaines 's Mill on June 27 . He did not return to command until September , following the Battle of Antietam , when he was given command of a division in the Right Wing of the Army of Northern Virginia , in the command of Major General James Longstreet , which became the I Corps that December . His division was lightly engaged at the Battle of Fredericksburg and , along with most of Longstreet 's Corps , missed the Battle of Chancellorsville while participating in the Suffolk Campaign in 1863 . During the Gettysburg Campaign , his division was , much to Pickett 's frustration , the last to arrive on the field .",
  "/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-3)": "In the United States Army ( USA ) , U.S. Marine Corps ( USMC ) , and U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) , captain ( abbreviated CPT in the USA and Capt in the USMC and USAF ) is a company grade officer rank , with the pay grade of O-3 . It ranks above first lieutenant and below major . It is equivalent to the rank of lieutenant in the Navy/Coast Guard officer rank system . The insignia for the rank consists of two silver bars , with slight stylized differences between the Army/Air Force version and the Marine Corps version .",
  "/wiki/Major_general_(CSA)": "The general officers of the Confederate States Army ( CSA ) were the senior military leaders of the Confederacy during the American Civil War of 1861-1865 . They were often former officers from the United States Army ( the regular army ) prior to the Civil War , while others were given the rank based on merit or when necessity demanded . Most Confederate generals needed confirmation from the Confederate Congress , much like prospective generals in the modern U.S. armed forces . Like all of the Confederacy 's military forces , these generals answered to their civilian leadership , in particular Jefferson Davis , the South 's president and therefore commander-in-chief of the Army , Navy , and Marines of the Confederate States .",
  "/wiki/Pickett's_Charge": "Pickett 's Charge was an infantry assault ordered by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee against Maj. Gen. George G. Meade 's Union positions on July 3 , 1863 , the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg in the state of Pennsylvania during the American Civil War . Its futility was predicted by the charge 's commander , Lt. Gen. James Longstreet , and it was arguably an avoidable mistake from which the Southern war effort never fully recovered militarily or psychologically . The farthest point reached by the attack has been referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy . The charge is named after Maj. Gen. George Pickett , one of three Confederate generals who led the assault under Longstreet . Pickett 's Charge was part of Lee 's general plan to take Cemetery Hill and the network of roads it commanded . His military secretary , Armistead Lindsay Long , described Lee 's thinking :",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg": "The Battle of Gettysburg ( locally /\u02c8\u0261\u025bt\u026asb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ ( listen ) ) was fought July 1-3 , 1863 , in and around the town of Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War . The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south . On the second day of battle , most of both armies had assembled . The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook .",
  "/wiki/John_Bell_Hood": "John Bell Hood ( June 1 or June 29 , 1831 - August 30 , 1879 ) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War . Hood had a reputation for bravery and aggressiveness that sometimes bordered on recklessness . Arguably one of the best brigade and division commanders in the CSA , Hood gradually became increasingly ineffective as he was promoted to lead larger , independent commands late in the war ; his career and reputation were marred by his decisive defeats leading an army in the Atlanta Campaign and the Franklin-Nashville Campaign . Hood 's education at the United States Military Academy led to a career as a junior officer in both the infantry and cavalry of the antebellum U.S. Army in California and Texas . At the start of the Civil War , he offered his services to his adopted state of Texas . He achieved his reputation for aggressive leadership as a brigade commander in the army of Robert E. Lee during the Seven Days Battles in 1862 , after which he was promoted to division command . He led a division under James Longstreet in the campaigns of 1862-63 . At the Battle of Gettysburg , he was severely wounded , rendering his left arm useless for the rest of his life . Transferred with many of Longstreet 's troops to the Western Theater , Hood led a massive assault into a gap in the Union line at the Battle of Chickamauga , but was wounded again , requiring the amputation of his right leg . Hood returned to field service during the Atlanta Campaign of 1864 , and at the age of 33 was promoted to temporary full general and command of the Army of Tennessee at the outskirts of Atlanta , making him the youngest soldier on either side of the war to be given command of an army . There , he dissipated his army in a series of bold , calculated , but unfortunate assaults , and was forced to evacuate the besieged city . Leading his men through Alabama and into Tennessee , his army was severely damaged in a massive frontal assault at the Battle of Franklin and he was decisively defeated at the Battle of Nashville by his former West Point instructor , Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas , after which he was relieved of command .",

  "/wiki/J.E.B._Stuart": "James Ewell Brown Jeb Stuart ( February 6 , 1833 - May 12 , 1864 ) was a United States Army officer from Virginia who became a Confederate States Army general during the American Civil War . He was known to his friends as Jeb , from the initials of his given names . Stuart was a cavalry commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations . While he cultivated a cavalier image ( red-lined gray cape , yellow sash , hat cocked to the side with an ostrich plume , red flower in his lapel , often sporting cologne ) , his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of Robert E. Lee 's army and inspired Southern morale . Stuart graduated from West Point in 1854 , and served in Texas and Kansas with the U.S. Army . In 1855 , he married Flora Cooke . His father-in-law was the Father of the US Cavalry , Philip St. George Cooke . Stuart was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with American Indians and the violence of Bleeding Kansas , and he participated in the capture of John Brown at Harpers Ferry . He resigned , when his home state of Virginia seceded , to serve in the Confederate Army , first under Stonewall Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley , but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the Army of Northern Virginia , playing a role in all of that army 's campaigns until his death . He established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions ( during the Peninsula Campaign and the Maryland Campaign ) circumnavigated the Union Army of the Potomac , bringing fame to himself and embarrassment to the North . At the Battle of Chancellorsville , he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded Stonewall Jackson 's infantry corps . Stuart 's most famous campaign , the Gettysburg Campaign , was flawed when his long separation from Lee 's army left Lee unaware of Union troop movements so that Lee was surprised and almost trapped at the Battle of Gettysburg .",
  "/wiki/American_Indian_Wars": "The American Indian Wars ( also known as the Indian Wars or the First Nations Wars ; French : Guerres des Premi\u00e8res Nations ) is the collective name for the various armed conflicts that were fought by European governments and colonists , and later by the governments and settlers , against various American Indian and First Nation tribes . These conflicts occurred in North America from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the early 20th century . The various wars resulted from a wide variety of factors , including cultural clashes , land disputes , and criminal acts committed by both sides . The European powers and their colonies also enlisted Indian tribes to help them conduct warfare against each other 's colonial settlements . After the American Revolution , many conflicts were local to specific states or regions and frequently involved disputes over land use ; some entailed cycles of violent reprisal . In Canada , 11 Numbered Treaties covering most of the First Nations lands limited the number of such conflicts . As settlers spread westward across America and Canada after 1780 , armed conflicts increased in size , duration , and intensity between settlers and various Indian and First Nation tribes . The climax came in the War of 1812 , when major Indian coalitions in the Midwest and the South fought against the United States and lost . Conflict with settlers became much less common and was usually resolved by treaty , often through sale or exchange of territory between the federal government and specific tribes . The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the American government to enforce the Indian removal from east of the Mississippi River to the west on the American frontier , especially Oklahoma . The federal policy of removal was eventually refined in the West , as American settlers kept expanding their territories , to relocate Indian tribes to specially designated and federally protected and subsidized reservations .",
  "/wiki/Peninsula_Campaign": "The Peninsula campaign ( also known as the Peninsular campaign ) of the American Civil War was a major Union operation launched in southeastern Virginia from March through July 1862 , the first large-scale offensive in the Eastern Theater . The operation , commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , was an amphibious turning movement against the Confederate States Army in Northern Virginia , intended to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond . McClellan was initially successful against the equally cautious General Joseph E. Johnston , but the emergence of the more aggressive General Robert E. Lee turned the subsequent Seven Days Battles into a humiliating Union defeat . McClellan landed his army at Fort Monroe and moved northwest , up the Virginia Peninsula . Confederate Brig . Gen. John B. Magruder 's defensive position on the Warwick Line caught McClellan by surprise . His hopes for a quick advance foiled , McClellan ordered his army to prepare for a siege of Yorktown . Just before the siege preparations were completed , the Confederates , now under the direct command of Johnston , began a withdrawal toward Richmond . The first heavy fighting of the campaign occurred in the Battle of Williamsburg , in which the Union troops managed some tactical victories , but the Confederates continued their withdrawal . An amphibious flanking movement to Eltham 's Landing was ineffective in cutting off the Confederate retreat . In the Battle of Drewry 's Bluff , an attempt by the U.S. Navy to reach Richmond by way of the James River was repulsed . As McClellan 's army reached the outskirts of Richmond , a minor battle occurred at Hanover Court House , but it was followed by a surprise attack by Johnston at the Battle of Seven Pines or Fair Oaks .",
  "/wiki/Maryland_Campaign": "The Maryland campaign - or Antietam campaign - occurred September 4-20 , 1862 , during the American Civil War . Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's first invasion of the North was repulsed by the Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , who moved to intercept Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia and eventually attacked it near Sharpsburg , Maryland . The resulting Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest single-day battle in American history . Following his victory in the northern Virginia campaign , Lee moved north with 55,000 men through the Shenandoah Valley starting on September 4 , 1862 . His objective was to resupply his army outside of the war-torn Virginia theater and to damage Northern morale in anticipation of the November elections . He undertook the risky maneuver of splitting his army so that he could continue north into Maryland while simultaneously capturing the Federal garrison and arsenal at Harpers Ferry . McClellan accidentally found a copy of Lee 's orders to his subordinate commanders and planned to isolate and defeat the separated portions of Lee 's army . While Confederate Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson surrounded , bombarded , and captured Harpers Ferry ( September 12-15 ) , McClellan 's army of 102,000 men attempted to move quickly through the South Mountain passes that separated him from Lee . The Battle of South Mountain on September 14 delayed McClellan 's advance and allowed Lee sufficient time to concentrate most of his army at Sharpsburg . The Battle of Antietam ( or Sharpsburg ) on September 17 was the bloodiest day in American military history with over 22,000 casualties . Lee , outnumbered two to one , moved his defensive forces to parry each offensive blow , but McClellan never deployed all of the reserves of his army to capitalize on localized successes and destroy the Confederates . On September 18 , Lee ordered a withdrawal across the Potomac and on September 19-20 , fights by Lee 's rear guard at Shepherdstown ended the campaign ."
