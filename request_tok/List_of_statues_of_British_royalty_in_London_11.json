  "/wiki/Royal_Exchange,_London": "The Royal Exchange in London was founded in the 16th century by the merchant Sir Thomas Gresham on the suggestion of his factor Richard Clough to act as a centre of commerce for the City of London .

It is trapezoidal in shape and is flanked by Cornhill and Threadneedle Street , which converge at Bank junction in the heart of the City . It lies in the ward of Cornhill . The building 's original design was inspired by a bourse Gresham had seen in Antwerp , the Antwerp bourse , and was Britain 's first specialist commercial building . It has twice been destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt . The present building was designed by Sir William Tite in the 1840s . The site was notably occupied by the Lloyd 's insurance market for nearly 150 years . Today the Royal Exchange contains a Courtyard Grand Cafe , Threadneedle Cocktail Bar , Sauterelle Restaurant , luxury shops , and offices .

  "/wiki/Temple_Bar,_London": "Temple Bar was the principal ceremonial entrance to the City of London on its western side from the City of Westminster . In the middle ages , London expanded city jurisdiction beyond its walls to gates , called bars , which were erected across thoroughfares . Temple Bar is situated on the historic royal ceremonial route from the Tower of London to the Palace of Westminster , the two chief residences of the medieval English monarchs , and from the Palace of Westminster to St Paul 's Cathedral . The road east of Temple Bar and within the City is Fleet Street , while the road to the west , in Westminster , is The Strand . At Temple Bar , the Corporation of the City of London formerly erected a barrier to regulate trade into the City . The 19th century Royal Courts of Justice are located next to it on its north side , having been moved from Westminster Hall . To its south is the Temple Church , along with the Inner Temple and Middle Temple Inns of Court . As the most important entrance to the City of London from Westminster , it was formerly long the custom for the monarch to halt at Temple Bar before entering the City of London , in order for the Lord Mayor to offer the Corporation 's pearl-encrusted Sword of State as a token of loyalty . The term 'Temple Bar ' strictly refers to a notional bar or barrier across the route , but it is commonly used to refer to the 17th-century ornamental Baroque arched gateway designed by Christopher Wren , which spanned the road until its removal in 1878 . A memorial pedestal topped by a dragon symbol of London , and containing an image of Queen Victoria , was erected to mark the bar 's location in 1880 . Wren 's arch was preserved and was re-erected in 2004 in the City , in Paternoster Square next to St Paul 's Cathedral .",
