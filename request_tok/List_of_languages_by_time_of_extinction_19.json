Its characteristics are little known because of the extremely limited and fragmentary nature of the surviving texts . The origins of Elymian and its relationships with other languages are unclear . It is widely believed to have been part of the Indo-European language family , but even that is uncertain . Within the Indo-European languages , it has been speculated that Elymian was related to either the Italic languages or the Anatolian languages ( such as Hittite ) , although both theories are disputed .",
  "/wiki/Unclassified_languages": "An unclassified language is a language whose genetic affiliation to other languages has not been established .

Some poorly known extinct languages , such as Gutian and Cac\u00e1n , are simply unclassifiable , and it is unlikely the situation will ever change . A supposedly unclassified language may turn out not to be a language at all , or even a distinct dialect , but merely a family , tribal or village name , or an alternative name for a people or language that is classified . If a language 's genetic relationship has not been established after significant documentation of the language and comparison with other languages and families , as in the case of Basque in Europe , it is considered a language isolate - that is , it is classified as a language family of its own .

It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana . Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea , south of the Italian Peninsula , from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina . Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3,329 m ( 10,922 ft ) high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate . The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , and the House of Habsburg . It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand , a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification , and a plebiscite . Sicily was given special status as an autonomous region on 15 May 1946 , 18 days before the Italian constitutional referendum of 1946 .",

Undiscovered until the late 19th and 20th centuries , they are considered the earliest group of languages to branch off from the Indo-European family . Once discovered , the presence of laryngeal consonants \u1e2b and \u1e2b\u1e2b in Hittite and Luwian provided support for the laryngeal theory of Proto-Indo-European linguistics .

It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives . The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and early 20th centuries .",

The language is attested in graffiti and in coin legends from the late 8th century or the early 7th century to the 3rd century BC , but well-preserved inscriptions of significant length are so far limited to the 5th century and the 4th century BC , during the period of Persian domination . Thus , Lydian texts are effectively contemporaneous with those in Lycian . Extant Lydian texts now number slightly over 100 , all but a few having been found in or near Sardis , the Lydian capital , but fewer than 30 of the inscriptions consist of more than a few words or are reasonably complete . Most of the inscriptions are on stone and are sepulchral in content , but several are decrees of one sort or another , and some half-dozen texts seem to be in verse , with a stress-based meter and vowel assonance at the end of the line .

  "/wiki/Indo-European_languages": "The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects in Asia and Europe . There are about 445 living Indo-European languages , according to the estimate by Ethnologue , with over two thirds ( 313 ) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch . The Indo-European languages with the greatest numbers of native speakers are Spanish , English , Hindustani ( Hindi/Urdu ) , Portuguese , Bengali , Punjabi , and Russian , each with over 100 million speakers , with German , French , Marathi , Italian , and Persian also having more than 50 million . Today , 46% of the world 's population ( 3.2 billion ) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language , by far the highest of any language family . The Indo-European family includes most of the modern languages of Europe . The language family is also represented in Asia with the exception of East and Southeast Asia . It was prominent ( alongside non-Indo-European languages ) in ancient Anatolia ( present-day Turkey ) , the ancient Tarim Basin ( present-day Northwest China ) and most of Central Asia until the medieval Turkic and Mongol invasions . Outside Eurasia , Indo-European languages are dominant in the Americas and much of Oceania and Africa , having reached there through colonialism during the Age of Discovery and later periods . Indo-European languages are also most commonly present as minority languages or second languages in countries where other families are dominant . With written evidence appearing from the Bronze Age in the form of Mycenaean Greek and the Anatolian languages Hittite and Luwian , the Indo-European family is significant to the field of historical linguistics as possessing the second-longest recorded history , after the Afroasiatic family in the form of the Egyptian language and the Semitic languages of the Near East . In addition , certain extinct language isolates of the Near East and Anatolia , such as Sumerian , Elamite , Hurrian , Hattian , Gutian , and Kassite are also recorded earlier than any Indo-European tongue . All Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language , reconstructed as Proto-Indo-European , spoken sometime in the Neolithic era .",

  "/wiki/Oscan_language": "Oscan is an extinct Indo-European language of southern Italy . The language is also the namesake of the language group to which it belonged . As a member of the Italic languages , Oscan is therefore a sister language to Latin and Umbrian .

The Oscan group is part of the Osco-Umbrian or Sabellic family , and includes the Oscan language and three variants ( Hernican , Marrucinian and Paelignian ) known only from inscriptions left by the Hernici , Marrucini and Paeligni , minor tribes of eastern central Italy .

  "/wiki/Italic_languages": "The Italic languages form a branch of the Indo-European language family , whose earliest known members were spoken in the Italian peninsula in the first millennium BC . The most important of the ancient languages was Latin , the official language of the Roman Empire , which conquered the other Italic peoples before the common era . The other Italic languages became extinct in the first centuries CE as their speakers were assimilated into the Roman Empire and shifted to some form of Latin . Between the third and eighth centuries CE , Vulgar Latin ( perhaps influenced by language-shift from the other Italic languages ) diversified into the Romance languages , which are the only Italic languages natively spoken today . Besides Latin , the known ancient Italic languages are Faliscan ( the closest to Latin ) , Umbrian and Oscan ( or Osco-Umbrian ) , and South Picene . Other Indo-European languages once spoken in the peninsula , whose inclusion in the Italic branch is disputed , are Aequian , Vestinian , Venetic and Sicel . These long-extinct languages are known only from inscriptions in archaeological finds . In the first millennium BC , several ( other ) non-Italic languages were spoken in the peninsula , including members of other branches of Indo-European ( such as Celtic and Greek ) as well as at least one non-Indo-European one , Etruscan . It is generally believed that those 1st millennium Italic languages descend from Indo-European languages brought by migrants to the peninsula sometime in the 2nd millennium BC . [ citation needed ] However , the source of those migrations and the history of the languages in the peninsula are still the matter of debate among historians . In particular , it is debated whether the ancient Italic languages all descended from a single Proto-Italic language after its arrival in the region , or whether the migrants brought two or more Indo-European languages that were only distantly related . With over 800 million native speakers , the Romance languages make Italic the second-most-widely spoken branch of the Indo-European family , after Indo-Iranian .",

The Sabines divided into two populations just after the founding of Rome , which is described by Roman legend . The division , however it came about , is not legendary . The population closer to Rome transplanted itself to the new city and united with the preexisting citizenry , beginning a new heritage that descended from the Sabines but was also Latinized .

In eastern Crete about half a dozen inscriptions have been found which , though written in Greek alphabets , are clearly not Greek . These inscriptions date from the late 7th or early 6th century down to the 3rd century BC . The language , which is not understood , is probably a survival of a language spoken on Crete before the arrival of Greeks and is probably derived from the Minoan language preserved in the Linear A inscriptions of a millennium earlier . Since that language remains untranslated , it is not certain that Eteocretan and Minoan are related , although this is very likely . Ancient testimony suggests that the language is that of the Eteocretans , i.e . true Cretans . The term Eteocretan is sometimes applied to the Minoan language ( or languages ) written more than a millennium earlier in so-called Cretan 'hieroglyphics ' ( almost certainly a syllabary ) and in the Linear A script . Yves Duhoux , a leading authority on Eteocretan , has stated that it is essential to rigorously separate the study of Eteocretan from that of the 'hieroglyphic ' and Linear A inscriptions .",
  "/wiki/Language_isolate": "A language isolate , in the absolute sense , is a natural language with no demonstrable genealogical ( or genetic ) relationship with other languages , one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor common with any other language . Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language . Commonly cited examples include Ainu , Basque , Sumerian , Elamite , and Vedda , though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages . Some sources use the term language isolate to indicate a branch of a larger family with only one surviving member . For instance , Albanian , Armenian and Greek are commonly called Indo-European isolates . While part of the Indo-European family , they do not belong to any established branch ( such as the Romance , Indo-Iranian , Celtic , Slavic or Germanic branches ) , but instead form independent branches . Similarly , within the Romance languages , Sardinian is a relative isolate . However , without a qualifier , isolate is understood to mean having no demonstrable genetic relationship to any other known language . Some languages once seen as isolates may be reclassified as small families . This happened with Japanese ( now included in the Japonic family along with Ryukyuan languages such as Okinawan ) and Korean in Koreanic languages with Jeju language . The Etruscan language of Italy has long been considered an isolate , but some have proposed that it is related to the so-called Tyrsenian languages , an extinct family of closely related ancient languages proposed by Helmut Rix in 1998 , including the Rhaetian language , formerly spoken in the central Alps , and the Lemnian language , formerly spoken on the Greek island of Lemnos .

The Xanthus inscription is in verse , with strophes marked off by the use of \u27e8 ) \u27e9 . In 1999 the Dutch scholar Alric van den Broek wrote an MA thesis at the Leiden University on the probable metric features of the Lycian B text of the Xanthos stele . Using Ivo Hajnals definitions of Lycian B syllables , he indicated that there is a significantly high number of word boundaries around the 11th , 22nd and 33rd syllable before ( on the left side of ) the phrase ending sign < ) > . Therefore , he argued , the text must have been a poem with four lines per phrase - the first one being either 7 ( +/-1 ) or 11 ( +/-1 ) syllables long and the last three lines counting 11 ( +/-1 ) syllables . Moreover , the metrical foot may have counted four syllables , with accents on syllables one , five and nine of each verse . His model also seemed to fit the few things we know of Lycian , Anatolian and Proto-Indo-European accent ."
