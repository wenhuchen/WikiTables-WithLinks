The city 's population was estimated at 987,310 in 2015 with the metropolitan area estimated at a population of 2,618,894 . The metropolitan area is defined by the IHSI as including the communes of Port-au-Prince , Delmas , Cite Soleil , Tabarre , Carrefour , and P\u00e9tion-Ville . The city of Port-au-Prince is on the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve : the bay on which the city lies , which acts as a natural harbor , has sustained economic activity since the civilizations of the Arawaks . It was first incorporated under French colonial rule in 1749 . The city 's layout is similar to that of an amphitheatre ; commercial districts are near the water , while residential neighborhoods are located on the hills above . Its population is difficult to ascertain due to the rapid growth of slums in the hillsides above the city ; however , recent estimates place the metropolitan area 's population at around 3.7 million , nearly half of the country 's national population . The city was catastrophically affected by a devastating earthquake in 2010 , with large numbers of structures damaged or destroyed . Haiti 's government estimated the death toll to be 230,000 .",
  "/wiki/Haiti": "Haiti ( /\u02c8he\u026ati/ ( listen ) ; French : Ha\u00efti [ a.iti ] ; Haitian Creole : Ayiti [ ajiti ] ) , officially the Republic of Haiti ( French : R\u00e9publique d'Ha\u00efti ; Haitian Creole : Repiblik D Ayiti ) and formerly called Hayti , [ note 1 ] is a country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea , to the east of Cuba and Jamaica and south of The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands . It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic . To its south-west lies the small island of Navassa Island , which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration . Haiti is 27,750 square kilometers ( 10,714 sq mi ) in size and has an estimated population of 11.1 million , making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Cuba . The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , who migrated from South America . The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue . French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations , worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa , which made the colony one of the richest in the world . In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789-99 ) , slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture . After 12 years of conflict , Napoleon Bonaparte 's forces were defeated by Louverture 's successor , Jean-Jacques Dessalines ( later Emperor Jacques I ) , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty on 1 January 1804 - the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the first country to abolish slavery , and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt .",

  "/wiki/Bogot\u00e1": "Bogot\u00e1 ( /\u02ccbo\u028a\u0261\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0/ , also UK : /\u02ccb\u0252\u0261-/ , US : /\u02c8bo\u028a\u0261\u0259t\u0251\u02d0/ , Spanish : [ bo\u0263o\u02c8ta ] ( listen ) ) , officially Bogot\u00e1 , Distrito Capital , abbreviated Bogot\u00e1 , D.C. , and formerly known as Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1 between 1991 and 2000 , is the capital and largest city of Colombia , administered as the Capital District , as well as the capital of the department of Cundinamarca . Bogot\u00e1 is a territorial entity of the first order , with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia . It is the political , economic , administrative and industrial center of the country . Bogot\u00e1 was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on August 6 , 1538 , by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca . The Muisca were the indigenous inhabitants of the region , and they called the place of the foundation Thybzaca or Old Town . The name of Bogot\u00e1 corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Muisca Bacat\u00e1 ( or Mueket\u00e1 ) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota . There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Bacat\u00e1 , the most accepted being that it means walling of the farmland in the Chibcha language . Another popular translation argues that it means The Lady of the Andes . Further , the word 'Andes ' in the Aymara language means shining mountain , thus rendering the full lexical signification of Bogot\u00e1 as The Lady of the shining mountain ( notice , however , that the language of the Muisca people was not Aymara but Chibcha ) . Others suggest that Bacat\u00e1 was the name of the Muisca cacique who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived . Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada gave the settlement the name of Our Lady of Hope but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santaf\u00e9 ( Holy Faith ) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city . Santaf\u00e9 became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada ( created in 1550 ) , and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada .",

Colombia is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea , the northwest by Panama , the south by both Ecuador and Peru , the east by Venezuela , the southeast by Brazil , and the west by the Pacific . It comprises thirty-two departments , with the capital in Bogot\u00e1 . Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona . Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law .",
