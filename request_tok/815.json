  "/wiki/Blees_Military_Academy": "Blees Military Academy , also known as Still-HiIdreth Osteopathic Sanatorium , is a historic military academy located at Macon , Macon County , Missouri . The academy operated between 1899 and 1907 . The old Academic Hall and Gymnasium of Blees Academy were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 . Blees Military Academy was founded in September 1899 by Colonel Frederick W. V. Blees . Blees was a Prussian immigrant who arrived in Macon in 1889 to take over as headmaster of St. James Academy , an Episcopalian military school for boys . In 1896 , Blees inherited his father 's coal and iron mining interests in Germany , and he used his newfound wealth to benefit the City of Macon , including building commercial buildings , the town 's first theater and sewage system ; a local horseless carriage factory , the First National Bank of Macon , and financing the paving of the town 's streets . In 1898-1899 , Blees took on the project that he hoped would be his legacy - the construction of the Blees Military Academy . Architecturally , Academic Hall and the Gymnasium are a unique expression of the Romanesque Revival style in their rural locale . As originally constructed , the Academy was provided with 400 acres ( 1.6 km2 ) surrounding on which were located orchards , a working farm , extensive gardens and a dairy , the pastoral nature of the surrounding environment survives and acts to enhance , through contrast , the monumental Romanesque Revival architecture of Academic Hall and the Gymnasium . Blees cadets rode Rex McDonald and George Washington , two of the nation 's best saddle horses . They played polo and had the most luxurious accommodations of the time . Blees spared no expense with this Academy .",
