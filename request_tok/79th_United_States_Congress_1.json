There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators .

As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House .

  "/wiki/United_States_Tax_Court": "The United States Tax Court ( in case citations , T.C . ) is a federal trial court of record established by Congress under Article I of the U.S. Constitution , section 8 of which provides ( in part ) that the Congress has the power to constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court . The Tax Court specializes in adjudicating disputes over federal income tax , generally prior to the time at which formal tax assessments are made by the Internal Revenue Service . Though taxpayers may choose to litigate tax matters in a variety of legal settings , outside of bankruptcy , the Tax Court is the only forum in which taxpayers may do so without having first paid the disputed tax in full . Parties who contest the imposition of a tax may also bring an action in any United States District Court , or in the United States Court of Federal Claims ; however these venues require that the tax be paid first , and that the party then file a lawsuit to recover the contested amount paid ( the full payment rule of Flora v. United States ) . Tax Court judges are appointed for a term of 15 years , subject to presidential removal for inefficiency , neglect of duty , or malfeasance in office . The main emblem of the tax court represents a fasces .",

  "/wiki/Pennsylvania's_10th_congressional_district": "Pennsylvania 's 10th Congressional District is located in the south-central region of the state . It encompasses all of Dauphin County as well as parts of Cumberland County and York County . The district includes the cities of Harrisburg and York . Prior to 2019 , the district was located in the northeastern part of the state . The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew the district in 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional due to gerrymandering . They added State College to the old district 's boundaries while removing some Democratic-leaning areas and redesignated it the twelfth district , and they reassigned the tenth district to an area around Harrisburg and York . The new tenth district is represented by Republican Scott Perry , who previously represented the old fourth district . The district was one of the 12 original districts created prior to the 4th Congress . In 2006 , when it was still located in northeastern Pennsylvania , the 10th district experienced one of the greatest party shifts among all House seats that switched party control : in 2004 , Republican Don Sherwood won with an 86% margin of victory over his nearest opponent and two years later , Democrat Chris Carney unseated Sherwood by a 53-47% margin . In 2008 , Carney won reelection by 12 points but the district swung back in 2010 , electing Republican Tom Marino . The district was mostly Republican in its political composition , an aspect of the district that was reflected especially well in presidential elections . In 2004 , President George W. Bush won 60 percent of the vote in the district and in 2008 , Senator John McCain beat Senator Barack Obama here by a margin of 54 percent to 45 percent .",

  "/wiki/Governor_of_Puerto_Rico": "The governor of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : gobernador ( a ) de Puerto Rico ) is the head of government of Puerto Rico and , by its nature , constitutes the executive branch of the government of the island . The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the island 's military forces , the Puerto Rico National Guard . The governor has a duty to enforce its laws , to convene the Legislative Assembly , the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Legislative Assembly , to appoint government officers , to appoint justices , and to grant pardons . Since 1948 , the governor has been elected by the people of Puerto Rico . Prior to that , the governor was appointed either by the king of Spain ( 1510-1898 ) or the president of the United States ( 1898-1948 ) . Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico vests the executive power on the governor and empowers them with the faculty to appoint officers . Law No . 104 of 1956 empowers them with the faculty to delegate functions . These two faculties in conjunction allow the governor to delegate most of their functions while continuing to be the maximum officer and head of government . Most of the governor 's functions are delegated [ citation needed ] to the chief of staff , who is charged with managing and overseeing all the executive departments and almost all executive agencies . The budget is delegated to the director of the Office of Management and Budget while centralized planning is delegated to the president of the Planning Board . This effectively makes the governor a political figure rather than an administrative one , allowing them to set the vision for what the island should be and where it should go rather than having to be involved in its day-to-day operations .",
