It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance , especially the ornamental stonework as designed by the National Park Service and built by the Civilian Conservation Corps . The original bridge was built in 1921 with a span of 16 feet ( 4.9 m ) and a width of 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) . In 1939 the bridge was widened to 60 feet ( 18 m ) to fit the roadway and two granite sidewalks . The basic construction was still a concrete slab , but the abutment extensions , railings , and retaining walls were built of random-coursed granite . This was part of a roadside beautification and wayside development project near the town of Garrison . The elaborate stonework was undertaken as part of the work relief offered through the New Deal , so a labor-intensive approach was chosen .",

  "/wiki/Concrete_slab": "A concrete slab is a common structural element of modern buildings , consisting of a flat , horizontal surface made of cast concrete . Steel-reinforced slabs , typically between 100 and 500 mm thick , are most often used to construct floors and ceilings , while thinner mud slabs may be used for exterior paving ( see below ) . In many domestic and industrial buildings , a thick concrete slab supported on foundations or directly on the subsoil , is used to construct the ground floor . These slabs are generally classified as ground-bearing or suspended . A slab is ground-bearing if it rests directly on the foundation , otherwise the slab is suspended . For multi-storey buildings , there are several common slab designs ( see \u00a7 Design for more types ) :",
  "/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps": "The Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) was a voluntary public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed , unmarried men . Originally for young men ages 18-25 , it was eventually expanded to ages 17-28 . Robert Fechner was the first director of this agency , succeeded by James McEntee following Fechner 's death . The CCC was a major part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal that provided manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal , state , and local governments . The CCC was designed to provide jobs for young men and to relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the Great Depression in the United States . Maximum enrollment at any one time was 300,000 . Through the course of its nine years in operation , 3 million young men participated in the CCC , which provided them with shelter , clothing , and food , together with a wage of $ 30 ( equivalent to $ 590 in 2019 ) per month ( $ 25 of which had to be sent home to their families ) .",

  "/wiki/Type_site": "In archaeology a type site ( also known as a type-site or typesite ) is a site that is considered the model of a particular archaeological culture . For example , the type site of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A culture is Jericho , in the West Bank . A type site is also often the eponym ( the site after which the culture is named ) . For example , the type site of the pre-Celtic/Celtic Bronze Age Hallstatt culture is the lakeside village of Hallstatt , Austria . In geology the term is used similarly for a site considered to be typical of a particular rock formation etc . A type site contains artifacts , in an assemblage , that are typical of that culture . Type sites are often the first or foundational site discovered about the culture they represent . The use of this term is therefore similar to that of the specimen type in biology ( see biological types ) or locus typicus ( type locality ) in geology .",

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",

  "/wiki/Good_Roads_Movement": "The Good Roads Movement occurred in the United States between the late 1870s and the 1920s . Advocates for improved roads led by bicyclists turned local agitation into a national political movement . Outside cities , roads were dirt or gravel ; mud in the winter and dust in the summer . Early organizers cited Europe where road construction and maintenance was supported by national and local governments . In its early years , the main goal of the movement was education for road building in rural areas between cities and to help rural populations gain the social and economic benefits enjoyed by cities where citizens benefited from railroads , trolleys and paved streets . Even more than traditional vehicles , the newly invented bicycles could benefit from good country roads .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
  "/wiki/Minneapolis\u2013Saint_Paul": "Minneapolis-Saint Paul is a major metropolitan area built around the Mississippi , Minnesota and St. Croix rivers in east central Minnesota . The area is commonly known as the Twin Cities after its two largest cities , Minneapolis , the most populous city in the state , and its neighbor to the east Saint Paul , the state capital . It is an example of twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity . Minnesotans living outside of Minneapolis and Saint Paul often refer to the two together ( or the seven-county metro area collectively ) as the Twin Cities . There are several different definitions of the region . Many refer to the Twin Cities as the seven-county region which is governed under the Metropolitan Council regional governmental agency and planning organization . The Office of Management and Budget officially designates 16 counties as the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area , the 16th largest in the United States . The entire region known as the Minneapolis-St. Paul MN-WI Combined Statistical Area , has a population of 4,014,593 , the 14th largest , according to 2018 Census estimates . Despite the Twin moniker , both cities are independent municipalities with defined borders . Minneapolis is somewhat younger with more modern skyscrapers downtown , while Saint Paul has been likened to an East Coast city , with quaint neighborhoods and a vast collection of well-preserved late-Victorian architecture .

It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing . The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority , which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power .",

  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture ( sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance ) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes . Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take .",
  "/wiki/Classical_Revival_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical ."
