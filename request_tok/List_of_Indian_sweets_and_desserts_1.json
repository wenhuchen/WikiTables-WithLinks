It should not be confused with the much smaller true black lentil ( Lens culinaris ) . Black gram originated in India , where it has been in cultivation from ancient times and is one of the most highly prized pulses of India and Pakistan . It is very widely used in Punjabi cuisine and is often referred to as maah di daal in the native language by Punjabis . The Coastal Andhra region in Andhra Pradesh is famous for black gram . The Guntur District ranks first in Andhra Pradesh for the production of black gram . Black gram has also been introduced to other tropical areas such as the Caribbean , Fiji , Mauritius , and Africa , mainly by Indian immigrants .",

  "/wiki/Sugar": "Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting , soluble carbohydrates , many of which are used in food . Simple sugars , also called monosaccharides , include glucose , fructose , and galactose . Compound sugars , also called disaccharides or double sugars , are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond . Common examples are sucrose ( glucose + fructose ) , lactose ( glucose + galactose ) , and maltose ( two molecules of glucose ) . In the body , compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars . Table sugar , granulated sugar or regular sugar refers to sucrose , a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose . Longer chains of monosaccharides are not regarded as sugars , and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides . Some other chemical substances , such as glycerol and sugar alcohols , may have a sweet taste , but are not classified as sugar . Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants . Honey and fruit are abundant natural sources of unbounded simple sugars . Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet , making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar . In 2016 , the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes .",
  "/wiki/Saffron": "Saffron ( pronounced /\u02c8s\u00e6fr\u0259n/ or /\u02c8s\u00e6fr\u0252n/ ) is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus , commonly known as the saffron crocus . The vivid crimson stigma and styles , called threads , are collected and dried for use mainly as a seasoning and colouring agent in food . Saffron has long been the world 's most costly spice by weight . Although some doubts remain on its origin , it is believed that saffron originated in Iran . However , Greece and Mesopotamia have also been suggested as the possible region of origin of this plant : Harold McGee states that it was domesticated in or near Greece during the Bronze Age . C. sativus is possibly a triploid form of Crocus cartwrightianus , which is itself native to Greece and Crete . Saffron crocus slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa , North America , and Oceania . Saffron 's taste and iodoform- or hay-like fragrance result from the phytochemicals , picrocrocin and safranal . It also contains a carotenoid pigment , crocin , which imparts a rich golden-yellow hue to dishes and textiles . Its recorded history is attested in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical treatise , and has been traded and used for over thousands of years . In the 21st century , Iran produces some 90% of the world total for saffron . At US $ 5,000 per kg or higher , saffron is the world 's most expensive spice .",

  "/wiki/Coconut": "The coconut tree ( Cocos nucifera ) is a member of the palm tree family ( Arecaceae ) and the only known living species of the genus Cocos . The term coconut ( or the archaic cocoanut ) can refer to the whole coconut palm , the seed , or the fruit , which botanically is a drupe , not a nut . The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word coco , meaning 'head ' or 'skull ' after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features . Coconuts are known for their versatility of uses , ranging from food to cosmetics . The inner flesh of the mature seed , as well as the coconut milk extracted from it , forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics . Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid , called coconut water or coconut juice . Mature , ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds , or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh , charcoal from the hard shell , and coir from the fibrous husk . Dried coconut flesh is called copra , and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking - frying in particular - as well as in soaps and cosmetics . The hard shells , fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decorating . The coconut also has cultural and religious significance in certain societies , particularly in India , where it is used in Hindu rituals .",
