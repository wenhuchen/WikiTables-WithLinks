  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship , often referred to as a steamer , is a type of steam-powered vessel , typically ocean-faring and seaworthy , that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move ( turn ) propellers or paddlewheels . The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s ; however , there were exceptions that came before . Steamships usually use the prefix designations of PS for paddle steamer or SS for screw steamer ( using a propeller or screw ) . As paddle steamers became less common , SS is assumed by many to stand for steamship . Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as MV for motor vessel , so it is not correct to use SS for most modern vessels . As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns , new trade routes opened up . The steamship has been described as a major driver of the first wave of trade globalization ( 1870-1913 ) and contributor to an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

Ores containing very high quantities of hematite or magnetite ( greater than about 60% iron ) are known as natural ore or direct shipping ore , meaning they can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces . Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron , which is one of the main raw materials to make steel - 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel . Indeed , it has been argued that iron ore is more integral to the global economy than any other commodity , except perhaps oil .",

  "/wiki/Sloop": "A sloop is a sailboat with a single mast typically meaning one headsail in front of the mast , and one mainsail aft of ( behind ) the mast . This is called a fore-and-aft rig , and can be rigged as a Bermuda rig with triangular sails fore and aft , or as a gaff-rig with triangular foresails and a gaff rigged mainsail . Sailboats can be classified according to type of rig , and so a sailboat may be a sloop , catboat , cutter , ketch , yawl , or schooner . A sloop usually has only one headsail , although an exception is the Friendship sloop , which is usually gaff-rigged with a bowsprit and multiple headsails . If the vessel has two or more headsails , the term cutter may be used , especially if the mast is stepped further towards the back of the boat . The name originates from the Dutch sloep , which is related to the Old English sl\u016bpan , to glide . In naval terminology , sloop-of-war refers to the purpose of the craft , rather than to the specific size or sail-plan , and thus a sloop should not be confused with a sloop-of-war . After the cat rig which has only a single sail , the Bermuda rig is the simplest sailing rig configurations . It is the most popular yacht rigging because it is easier to sail with a smaller crew or even single-handed , it is cheaper since it has less hardware than more complex rigs , and it sails well into the wind . A limitation is that when a boat gets over 45 feet in length , the sails become so large that they are difficult to handle , although modern technology is helping with this . The headsail can be masthead-rigged or fractional-rigged . On a masthead-rigged sloop , the forestay ( on which the headsail is carried ) attaches at the top of the mast .",

  "/wiki/Contributing_property": "In the law regulating historic districts in the United States , a contributing property or contributing resource is any building , object , or structure which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make the historic district , listed locally or federally , significant . Government agencies , at the state , national , and local level in the United States , have differing definitions of what constitutes a contributing property but there are common characteristics . Local laws often regulate the changes that can be made to contributing structures within designated historic districts . The first local ordinances dealing with the alteration of buildings within historic districts was in Charleston , South Carolina in 1931 . Properties within a historic district fall into one of two types of property : contributing and non-contributing . A contributing property , such as a 19th-century mansion , helps make a historic district historic , while a non-contributing property , such as a modern medical clinic , does not . The contributing properties are key to a historic district 's historic associations , historic architectural qualities , or archaeological qualities . A property can change from contributing to non-contributing and vice versa if significant alterations take place .",
  "/wiki/Shingle_style_architecture": "The Shingle style is an American architectural style made popular by the rise of the New England school of architecture , which eschewed the highly ornamented patterns of the Eastlake style in Queen Anne architecture . In the Shingle style , English influence was combined with the renewed interest in Colonial American architecture which followed the 1876 celebration of the Centennial . The plain , shingled surfaces of colonial buildings were adopted , and their massing emulated . Aside from being a style of design , the style also conveyed a sense of the house as continuous volume . This effect - of the building as an envelope of space , rather than a great mass , was enhanced by the visual tautness of the flat shingled surfaces , the horizontal shape of many Shingle style houses , and the emphasis on horizontal continuity , both in exterior details and in the flow of spaces within the houses .",

Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
  "/wiki/Lutheranism": "Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism that identifies with the teachings of Martin Luther , a 16th-century German reformer . Luther 's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation . The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings , beginning with the 95 Theses , divided Western Christianity . The split between the Lutherans and the Catholics was made public and clear with the 1521 Edict of Worms : the edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas , subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property , half of the seized property to be forfeit to the imperial government and the remaining half forfeit to the party who brought the accusation . The divide centered primarily on two points : the proper source of authority in the church , often called the formal principle of the Reformation , and the doctrine of justification , often called the material principle of Lutheran theology . [ a ] Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification by grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone , the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith . This is in contrast to the belief of the Roman Catholic Church , defined at the Council of Trent , concerning authority coming from both the Scriptures and Tradition . Unlike Calvinism , Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church , with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist , or Lord 's Supper . Lutheran theology differs from Reformed theology in Christology , divine grace , the purpose of God 's Law , the concept of perseverance of the saints , and predestination .",

  "/wiki/American_Foursquare": "The American Foursquare or American Four Square is an American house style popular from the mid-1890s to the late 1930s . A reaction to the ornate and mass-produced elements of the Victorian and other Revival styles popular throughout the last half of the 19th century , the American Foursquare was plain , often incorporating handcrafted honest woodwork ( unless purchased from a mail-order catalog ) . This style incorporates elements of the Prairie School and the Craftsman styles . It is also sometimes called Transitional Period . The hallmarks of the style include a basically square , boxy design , two-and-one-half stories high , usually with four large , boxy rooms to a floor , a center dormer , and a large front porch with wide stairs . The boxy shape provides a maximum amount of interior room space , to use a small city lot to best advantage . Other common features included a hipped roof , arched entries between common rooms , built-in cabinetry , and Craftsman-style woodwork . A typical design would be as follows : first floor , from front to back , on one side , the living room and dining room ; while on the other side , the entry room or foyer , stairway and kitchen . Sometimes a bathroom was also included . Second floor , front to back , on one side , bedroom , bathroom and bedroom ; while on the other side , bedroom , stairway and bedroom .

The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",

  "/wiki/Copper": "Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu ( from Latin : cuprum ) and atomic number 29 . It is a soft , malleable , and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity . A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color . Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity , as a building material , and as a constituent of various metal alloys , such as sterling silver used in jewelry , cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins , and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement . Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ( native metals ) . This led to very early human use in several regions , from c. 8000 BC . Thousands of years later , it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores , c. 5000 BC , the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold , c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal , tin , to create bronze , c. 3500 BC .

In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing .

An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson .

Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",
