  "/wiki/United_States_Barracuda-class_submarine_(1951)": "The Barracuda-class submarines ( originally the K-1-class submarines ) were the product of Project Kayo , a research and development effort begun immediately after World War II by the United States Navy to solve the problem of using submarines to attack and destroy enemy submarines . They originally had the hull classification symbol SSK , for hunter-killer submarine . It was known that the Soviet Navy had acquired the German Type XXI U-boat and other advanced submarines , and was expected to rapidly put derivatives of them into production . In 1948 the US Navy prepared estimates of the number of anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) -capable submarines ( SSKs ) that would be needed to counter the hundreds of advanced Soviet submarines that were expected to be in service by 1960 . Two scenarios were considered : a reasonable scenario assuming the Soviets would build to their existing force level of about 360 submarines , and a nightmare scenario projecting that the Soviets could build submarines as fast as the Germans had built U-boats , with a force level of 2,000 submarines . The projected US SSK force levels for these scenarios were 250 for the former and 970 for the latter . By comparison , the total US submarine force at the end of World War II , excluding obsolescent training submarines , was just over 200 boats . These submarines were originally named K-1 through K-3 , with hull numbers SSK-1 through SSK-3 . They were renamed Barracuda , Bass , and Bonita in December 1955 . In 1959 Barracuda was redesignated SST-3 ( SST for training submarine ) , and in 1964 her main sonar was removed . A final redesignation twist was SS-T3 in 1973 ; for some reason the Navy wished to list her as an attack submarine . Bass was decommissioned in 1957 and redesignated SS-551 in 1959 .",
  "/wiki/USS_Barracuda_(SSK-1)": "USS Barracuda ( SSK-1/SST-3/SS-550 ) ( originally USS K-1 ( SSK-1 ) ) , the lead ship of her class , was a submarine that was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the barracuda , a voracious , pike-like fish . Her keel was laid down on 1 July 1949 by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton , Connecticut . She was launched on 2 March 1951 as K-1 , sponsored by Mrs. Willis Manning Thomas ( her late husband died as commanding officer of USS Pompano ( SS-181 ) ) , and commissioned on 10 November 1951 with Lieutenant Commander F. A. Andrews in command . Notably , future President of the United States Jimmy Carter served as an officer on K-1 as part of its pre-commissioning crew and during its first year of active service until he was reassigned on 16 October 1952 . The three SSK boats , Barracuda ( SSK-1 ) , Bass ( SSK-2 ) , and Bonita ( SSK-3 ) , were equipped with the large BQR-4 bow-mounted sonar array as part of Project Kayo , which experimented with the use of passive acoustics via low-frequency bow-mounted sonar arrays . When the boat was rigged for silent running , these arrays gave greatly improved convergence zone detection ranges against snorkeling submarines . The SSKs themselves were limited in their anti-submarine warfare capabilities by their low speed and their need to snorkel periodically , but the advances in sonar technology they pioneered were invaluable to later nuclear-powered submarines . The class was developed as mobilization prototypes should large numbers of Soviet submarines based on the Type XXI U-boat appear . Barracuda joined Submarine Development Group 2 , which was stationed at her home port of New London , Connecticut . She cruised along the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada , in the Caribbean Sea , and made a voyage to Greenock and Rothesay , Scotland , in June 1955 . On 15 December 1955 her name was changed from K-1 to Barracuda ( SSK-1 ) . During intervals between and after these cruises , Barracuda operated along the eastern seaboard carrying out training and experimental exercises .",
  "/wiki/USS_Bonita_(SSK-3)": "USS Bonita ( SSK-3/SS-552 ) , a Barracuda-class submarine , was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bonito , a name applied to several types of fish , including the skipjack tuna , ( Katsuwonus pelamis ) , the Atlantic bonito ( Sarda sarda ) , the lesser amberjack ( Seriola fasciata ) , or the cobia ( Rachycentron canadum ) . She was originally named USS K-3 ( SSK-3 ) . The original contract for construction of K-3 ( SSK-3 ) was awarded to New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden , New Jersey , but later transferred to Mare Island Naval Shipyard of Vallejo , California , where her keel was laid down on 19 May 1950 . She was launched as K-3 on 21 June 1951 , sponsored by Mrs. J.S . Clark , widow of Commander James S. Clark ( who died while commanding USS Golet ( SS-361 ) ) , and commissioned on 11 January 1952 commanded by Lieutenant Commander Eric E. Hopley . The three SSK boats , K-1 ( SSK-1 ) , K-2 ( SSK-2 ) , and K-3 ( SSK-3 ) , were equipped with the large BQR-4 bow-mounted sonar array as part of Project Kayo , which experimented with the use of passive acoustics with low-frequency , bow-mounted sonar arrays . When the boat was rigged for silent running , these arrays gave greatly improved convergence zone detection ranges against snorkeling submarines . The SSKs themselves were limited in their anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) abilities by their low speed and their need to snorkel periodically to recharge their batteries , but the advances in sonar technology they pioneered were invaluable to the development of nuclear-powered submarines . The class was developed as mobilization prototypes should large numbers of Soviet submarines based on the Type XXI U-boat appear .",
  "/wiki/Tang-class_submarine": "The Tang-class submarines were the first submarines designed and built by the United States Navy after WWII . They incorporated the best features of the high-speed German Type XXI U-boat and the venerable U.S. Navy fleet submarine . The Tang-class and the fleet submarines converted under the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power ( GUPPY ) program had much higher submerged performance than their predecessors , but were quickly surpassed by the nuclear-propelled submarines that entered service beginning in 1954 .",
  "/wiki/USS_Tang_(SS-563)": "USS Tang ( SS/AGSS-563 ) , the lead ship of her class was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tang . She was the first American submarine designed ( as opposed to modified ) under the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program ( GUPPY ) for underwater performance rather than surfaced speed and handling . Key features included removing the deck guns , streamlining the outer hull , replacing the conning tower with a sail , installing new propellers designed for submerged operations , installing more air conditioning and a snorkel mast , and doubling the battery capacity . The contract to build her was awarded to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 16 May 1947 . Her keel was laid down on 18 April 1949 .

  "/wiki/USS_Albacore_(AGSS-569)": "USS Albacore ( AGSS-569 ) was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form ( sometimes referred to as an Albacore hull ) of modern submarines . The revolutionary design was derived from extensive hydrodynamic and wind tunnel testing , with an emphasis on underwater speed and maneuverability . She was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the albacore . Her keel was laid down on 15 March 1952 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery , Maine . She was launched on 1 August 1953 , sponsored by Mrs. J. E. Jowers , the widow of Chief Motor Machinist 's Mate Arthur L. Stanton , lost with the second Albacore ( SS-218 ) , and commissioned on 6 December 1953 with Lieutenant Commander Kenneth C. Gummerson in command . The effectiveness of submarines in World War II convinced both the Soviets and the United States Navy that undersea warfare would play an even more important role in coming conflicts and dictated development of superior submarines . The advent of nuclear power nourished the hope that such warships could be produced . The effort to achieve this goal involved the development of a nuclear propulsion system and the design of a streamlined submarine hull capable of optimum submerged performance .",
  "/wiki/Teardrop_hull": "A teardrop hull is a submarine hull design which emphasizes submerged performance over surfaced performance . It was somewhat commonly used in the early stages of submarine development , but was gradually abandoned in the early 20th century in favour of designs optimized for high performance on the surface as a result of flawed naval doctrine . Although naval doctrine changed , design practices remained until the later parts of World War II when the German Kriegsmarine suffered ever-growing losses of submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic . In an attempt to combat the growing threat of allied anti-submarine efforts , experimental design concepts dating back to the late interbellum were shoehorned into the existing submarine design process , resulting in a small number of hydrogen peroxide-powered submarines as well as the Elektroboot family of diesel-electric submarine classes . Although too late and too few to turn the war around , examination of these boats in the immediate post-war period heavily disrupted the institutional inertia which had kept the navies of the world focused on the diving torpedo boat in the previous decades , and led to an increased focus on submerged performance . This led to the eventual reintroduction of the teardrop hull in submarines , being employed in various forms on virtually all large undersea military vessels today .",

  "/wiki/USS_Nautilus_(SSN-571)": "USS Nautilus ( SSN-571 ) was the world 's first operational nuclear-powered submarine and the first submarine to complete a submerged transit of the North Pole on 3 August 1958 . Her initial commanding officer was Dennis Wilkinson , a widely respected naval officer who set the stage for many of the protocols of today 's Nuclear Navy , and who had a storied career during military service and afterwards . Sharing names with Captain Nemo 's fictional submarine in Jules Verne 's classic 1870 science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea , and named after another USS Nautilus ( SS-168 ) that served with distinction in World War II , [ citation needed ] the new nuclear powered Nautilus was authorized in 1951 , with laying down for construction in 1952 and launched in January 1954 , attended by Mamie Eisenhower , First Lady of the United States , wife of 34th President Dwight D. Eisenhower , and commissioned the following September into the United States Navy . Final construction was completed in 1955 . Because her nuclear propulsion allowed her to remain submerged far longer than diesel-electric submarines , she broke many records in her first years of operation , and traveled to locations previously beyond the limits of submarines . In operation , she revealed a number of limitations in her design and construction . This information was used to improve subsequent submarines . Nautilus was decommissioned in 1980 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982 . The submarine has been preserved as a museum ship at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton , Connecticut , where the vessel receives around 250,000 visitors per year .",

Only USS Argonaut ( SM-1 ) and the Narwhal-class submarines from the 1920s were larger . The Sailfishes were initially equipped with large BPS-2 and BPS-3 radars in and aft of the sail . They were designed for a high surface speed ; however , their speed achieved was not significantly faster than converted World War II radar picket submarines . Commissioned in 1956 , they served in the radar picket role until early 1961 , when the submarine radar picket mission ended fleetwide . Airborne radar had superseded it with the deployment of the Grumman WF-2 Tracer .

Since Regulus I and Regulus II programs had problems , Growler and Grayback were the only two submarines built in this class as instead , the U.S. Navy veered its nuclear deterrence efforts into submarine launched ballistic missiles ( SLBMs ) - the Polaris missile program . What makes Growler and her sister unusual was her nuclear armament , deployed on a conventional ( non-nuclear powered ) diesel-electric submarine . Her mission was to provide nuclear deterrent capability off the Pacific Coast of the Soviet Union during peak years of the Cold War , from 1958 to 1964 .",

Her overall design was a variant of Nautilus , but with numerous detail changes , such as a conning tower , stepped sail , and the AN/SQS-51 active sonar mounted in the top portion of the bow instead of further below . This sonar arrangement resulted in an unusual bow shape above the water for a U.S. submarine . Her distinctive reactor was later replaced with a standard pressurized water reactor , the replacement process lasting from 12 December 1958 to 30 September 1960 .",
  "/wiki/Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor": "A liquid metal cooled nuclear reactor , liquid metal fast reactor or LMFR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor where the primary coolant is a liquid metal . Liquid metal cooled reactors were first adapted for nuclear submarine use but have also been extensively studied for power generation applications . Metal coolants remove heat more rapidly and allow much higher power density . This makes them attractive in situations where size and weight are at a premium , like on ships and submarines . To improve cooling with water , most reactor designs are highly pressurized to raise the boiling point , which presents safety and maintenance issues that liquid metal designs lack . Additionally , the high temperature of the liquid metal can be used to produce vapour at higher temperature than in a water cooled reactor , leading to a higher thermodynamic efficiency . This makes them attractive for improving power output in conventional nuclear power plants . Liquid metals , being electrically highly conductive , can be moved by electromagnetic pumps . Disadvantages include difficulties associated with inspection and repair of a reactor immersed in opaque molten metal , and depending on the choice of metal , fire hazard risk ( for alkali metals ) , corrosion and/or production of radioactive activation products may be an issue .",
  "/wiki/Sodium": "Sodium is a chemical element with the symbol Na ( from Latin natrium ) and atomic number 11 . It is a soft , silvery-white , highly reactive metal . Sodium is an alkali metal , being in group 1 of the periodic table , because it has a single electron in its outer shell , which it readily donates , creating a positively charged ion - the Na+ cation . Its only stable isotope is 23Na . The free metal does not occur in nature , and must be prepared from compounds . Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth 's crust and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars , sodalite , and rock salt ( NaCl ) . Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble : sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth 's minerals over eons , and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans . Sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide . Among many other useful sodium compounds , sodium hydroxide ( lye ) is used in soap manufacture , and sodium chloride ( edible salt ) is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans . Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants . Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid ( ECF ) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume . Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration , a condition called hypernatremia .",

At 273 feet long and 2,640 tons displacement , USS Tullibee was the smallest nuclear-powered attack submarine in the US submarine fleet . The initial manning complement was 7 officers and 60 enlisted men . However before inactivation , the crew included 13 officers and over 100 enlisted men . During her career , Tullibee achieved much and conducted many submarine firsts . During her commissioned service she submerged and surfaced 730 times and traveled approximately 325,000 nautical miles ( 602,000 km ; 374,000 mi ) equal to the distance from the earth to the moon and halfway back .",
  "/wiki/Turbo-electric_transmission": "Turbo-electric transmission uses electric generators to convert the mechanical energy of a turbine ( steam or gas ) into electric energy and electric motors to convert it back into mechanical energy to power the driveshafts . Turbo-electric drives are used in some rail locomotives ( gas turbines , e.g . with the first TGV ) and ships ( steam and more recently gas turbines ) . An advantage of turbo-electric transmission is that it allows the adaptation of high-speed turbines to slow turning propellers or wheels without a heavy and complex gearbox . It has the advantage of being able to provide electricity for the ship or train 's other electrical systems , such as lighting , computers , radar , and communications equipment .",
