  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Music": "Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time . General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch ( which governs melody and harmony ) , rhythm ( and its associated concepts tempo , meter , and articulation ) , dynamics ( loudness and softness ) , and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture ( which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound ) . Different styles or types of music may emphasize , de-emphasize or omit some of these elements . Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping ; there are solely instrumental pieces , solely vocal pieces ( such as songs without instrumental accompaniment ) and pieces that combine singing and instruments . The word derives from Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( mousike ; art of the Muses ) . See glossary of musical terminology . In its most general form , the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music ( songs , tunes , symphonies , and so on ) , the criticism of music , the study of the history of music , and the aesthetic examination of music . Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies . Common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to . However , 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music , saying , for example , There is no noise , only sound . The creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context . Indeed , throughout history , some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music , including Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825 , early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s .",

  "/wiki/Movies": "Film , also called movie or motion picture or ( less widely ) The Seventh Art , is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty or atmosphere , by the means of recorded or programmed [ vague ] moving images , along with sound ( and more rarely ) other sensory stimulations . The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it . The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it , and is not projected ) . Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . They reflect those cultures , and , in turn , affect them . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating - or indoctrinating - citizens . The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved into position to be projected , but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears .",

  "/wiki/Electronics": "Electronics comprises the physics , engineering , technology and applications that deal with the emission , flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter . Electronics is widely used in information processing , telecommunication , and signal processing . The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible . Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards , electronics packaging technology , and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system , called an electronic system ; examples are computers or control systems . An electronic system may be a component of another engineered system or a standalone device . As of 2019 [ update ] most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control . The identification of the electron in 1897 , along with the invention of the vacuum tube , which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals , inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age . Commonly , electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements ; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit . Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes , transistors , diodes , integrated circuits , optoelectronics , and sensors , associated passive electrical components , and interconnection technologies . The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible . Electrical and electromechanical science and technology deals with the generation , distribution , switching , storage , and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms ( using wires , motors , generators , batteries , switches , relays , transformers , resistors , and other passive components ) .

  "/wiki/Video_On_Demand": "Video on demand ( VOD ) is a video media distribution system that allows users to access video entertainment without a traditional video entertainment device and without the constraints of a typical static broadcasting schedule . In the 20th century , broadcasting in the form of over-the-air programming was the commonest form of media distribution . As Internet and IPTV technologies continued to develop in the 1990s , consumers began to gravitate towards non-traditional modes of content consumption , which culminated in the arrival of VOD on televisions and personal computers . Unlike broadcast television , VOD systems initially required each user to have an Internet connection with considerable bandwidth to access each system 's content . In 2000 , the Fraunhofer Institute IIS developed the JPEG2000 codec , which enabled the distribution of movies via Digital Cinema Packages . This technology has since expanded its services from feature-film production to include broadcast television and has resulted in lower bandwidth requirements for VOD applications . Disney , Paramount , Sony , Universal and Warner Bros. subsequently launched the Digital Cinema Initiative , in 2002 . Television VOD systems can stream content , either through a traditional set-top box or through remote devices such as computers , tablets , and smartphones . VOD users can permanently download content to a device such as a computer , digital video recorder or a portable media player for continued viewing . The majority of cable and telephone company-based television providers offer VOD streaming , whereby a user selects a video program that begins to play immediately or downloading to a digital video recorder ( DVR ) rented or purchased from the provider , or to a PC or to a portable device for delayed viewing . Internet television has emerged as an increasingly popular medium of VOD provision . Desktop client applications such as the Apple iTunes online content store and Smart TV apps such as Amazon Prime Video allow temporary rentals and purchases of video entertainment content .",
