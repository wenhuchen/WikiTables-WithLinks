The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the state 's military forces . Seven people served as governor of Colorado Territory over eight terms , appointed by the President of the United States . Since statehood , there have been 36 governors , serving 41 distinct terms . The longest-serving governors were Richard Dick Lamm ( 1975-1987 ) and Roy Romer ( 1987-1999 ) , who each served 12 years over three terms . The shortest term occurred in March 16 and 17 , 1905 , when the state had three governors in the span of 24 hours : Alva Adams won the election , but soon after he took office , the legislature declared his opponent , James Hamilton Peabody , governor , but on the condition that he immediately resign , so that his lieutenant governor , Jesse McDonald , could be governor . Thus , Peabody served less than a day as governor . The current governor is Democrat Jared Polis , who took office on January 8 , 2019 ."
