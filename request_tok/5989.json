  "/wiki/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm": "Curb Your Enthusiasm is an American comedy television series produced and broadcast by HBO that premiered on October 15 , 2000 . The series was created by Larry David starring as a fictionalized version of himself . The series follows Larry in his life as a semi-retired television writer and producer in Los Angeles and for one season , New York City . Also starring are Cheryl Hines as his wife Cheryl , Jeff Garlin as his manager and best friend Jeff , and Susie Essman as Jeff 's wife Susie . Curb Your Enthusiasm often features guest stars , and many of these appearances are by celebrities playing versions of themselves fictionalized to varying degrees . The plots and subplots of the episodes are established in an outline written by David ( in later seasons , by David in collaboration with Jeff Schaffer and others ) , and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors ( a technique known as retroscripting ) . As with Seinfeld , which David co-created , the subject matter in Curb Your Enthusiasm often involves the minutiae of American daily social life , and plots often revolve around Larry David 's many faux pas and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations , as well as his annoyance with other people 's behavior . The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed , which often leads him into awkward situations . He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe that he has done something morally terrible or disgusting . The series was developed from a 1999 one-hour special , Larry David : Curb Your Enthusiasm , which David and HBO originally envisioned as a one-time project . The special was shot as a mockumentary , where the characters were aware of the presence of cameras and a crew . The series itself is not a mock documentary but is shot in a somewhat similar , cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9-like style ."
