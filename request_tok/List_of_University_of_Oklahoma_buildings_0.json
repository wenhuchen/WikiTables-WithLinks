  "/wiki/Library": "A library is a curated collection of sources of information and similar resources , selected by experts and made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing , often in a quiet environment conducive to study . It provides physical or digital access to material , and may be a physical location or a virtual space , or both . A library 's collection can include books , periodicals , newspapers , manuscripts , films , maps , prints , documents , microform , CDs , cassettes , videotapes , DVDs , Blu-ray Discs , e-books , audiobooks , databases , and other formats . Libraries range widely in size up to millions of items . In Latin and Greek , the idea of a bookcase is represented by Bibliotheca and Biblioth\u0113k\u0113 ( Greek : \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7 ) : derivatives of these mean library in many modern languages , e.g . French biblioth\u00e8que . The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing - the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in Sumer , some dating back to 2600 BC . Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC . In the 6th century , at the very close of the Classical period , the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria . The libraries of Timbuktu were also established around this time and attracted scholars from all over the world . A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body , an institution , a corporation , or a private individual . Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to - or can not afford to - purchase an extensive collection themselves , who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have , or who require professional assistance with their research .",

The Klan has existed in three distinct eras at different points in time during the history of the United States . Each has advocated extremist reactionary positions such as white nationalism , anti-immigration and - especially in later iterations - Nordicism and anti-Catholicism . Historically , the first Klan used terrorism - both physical assault and murder - against politically active blacks and their allies in the South in the late 1860s , until it was suppressed around 1872 . All three movements have called for the purification of American society and all are considered right-wing extremist organizations . In each era , membership was secret and estimates of the total were highly exaggerated by both friends and enemies . Known as the Invisible Empire of the South , the first Klan flourished in the Southern United States in the late 1860s during Reconstruction , then died out by the early 1870s . It sought to overthrow the Republican state governments in the South , especially by using violence against African-American leaders . Each chapter was autonomous and highly secret as to membership and plans . Its numerous chapters across the South were suppressed around 1871 , through federal law enforcement . Members made their own , often colorful , costumes : robes , masks and conical hats , designed to be terrifying and to hide their identities . The second Klan started small in Georgia in 1915 .",
  "/wiki/Chemistry": "Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms , molecules and ions : their composition , structure , properties , behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances . In the scope of its subject , chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology . It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level . For example , chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry ( botany ) , the formation of igneous rocks ( geology ) , how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded ( ecology ) , the properties of the soil on the moon ( astrophysics ) , how medications work ( pharmacology ) , and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene ( forensics ) . Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds . There are four types of chemical bonds : covalent bonds , in which compounds share one or more electron ( s ) ; ionic bonds , in which a compound donates one or more electrons to another compound to produce ions ( cations and anions ) ; hydrogen bonds ; and Van der Waals force bonds .",

  "/wiki/Botany": "Botany , also called plant science ( s ) , plant biology or phytology , is the science of plant life and a branch of biology . A botanist , plant scientist or phytologist is a scientist who specialises in this field . The term botany comes from the Ancient Greek word \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 ( botan\u0113 ) meaning pasture , grass , or fodder ; \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 is in turn derived from \u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( boskein ) , to feed or to graze . Traditionally , botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively , with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress . Nowadays , botanists ( in the strict sense ) study approximately 410,000 species of land plants of which some 391,000 species are vascular plants ( including approximately 369,000 species of flowering plants ) , and approximately 20,000 are bryophytes . Botany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify - and later cultivate - edible , medicinal and poisonous plants , making it one of the oldest branches of science . Medieval physic gardens , often attached to monasteries , contained plants of medical importance . They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities , founded from the 1540s onwards . One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden . These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants . Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy , and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day . In the 19th and 20th centuries , new techniques were developed for the study of plants , including methods of optical microscopy and live cell imaging , electron microscopy , analysis of chromosome number , plant chemistry and the structure and function of enzymes and other proteins .",

Microbiology encompasses numerous sub-disciplines including virology , parasitology , mycology and bacteriology . Eukaryotic microorganisms possess membrane-bound organelles and include fungi and protists , whereas prokaryotic organisms - all of which are microorganisms - are conventionally classified as lacking membrane-bound organelles and include Bacteria and Archaea . Microbiologists traditionally relied on culture , staining , and microscopy . However , less than 1% of the microorganisms present in common environments can be cultured in isolation using current means . Microbiologists often rely on molecular biology tools such as DNA sequence based identification , for example 16s rRNA gene sequence used for bacteria identification . Viruses have been variably classified as organisms , as they have been considered either as very simple microorganisms or very complex molecules . Prions , never considered as microorganisms , have been investigated by virologists , however , as the clinical effects traced to them were originally presumed due to chronic viral infections , and virologists took search - discovering infectious proteins . The existence of microorganisms was predicted many centuries before they were first observed , for example by the Jains in India and by Marcus Terentius Varro in ancient Rome . The first recorded microscope observation was of the fruiting bodies of moulds , by Robert Hooke in 1666 , but the Jesuit priest Athanasius Kircher was likely the first to see microbes , which he mentioned observing in milk and putrid material in 1658 . Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is considered a father of microbiology as he observed and experimented with microscopic organisms in 1676 , using simple microscopes of his own design . Scientific microbiology developed in the 19th century through the work of Louis Pasteur and in medical microbiology Robert Koch .",
