Ghana means Warrior King in the Soninke language . The first permanent state in the territory of present-day Ghana dates back to the 11th century . Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries , of which the most powerful was the Kingdom of Ashanti . Beginning in the 15th century , numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights , with the British ultimately established control of the coast by the late 19th century . Following over a century of native resistance , Ghana 's current borders were established by the 1900s as the British Gold Coast . It became independent of the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957 . Ghana 's population of approximately 30 million spans a variety of ethnic , linguistic and religious groups . According to the 2010 census , 71.2% of the population was Christian , 17.6% was Muslim , and 5.2% practised traditional faiths . Its diverse geography and ecology ranges from coastal savannahs to tropical rain forests .

From the 11th to the 16th century , various tribes entered the region from all directions . From the 16th century to the 18th century , the coastal region was a major trading center for Europeans to purchase slaves , earning Togo and the surrounding region the name The Slave Coast . In 1884 , Germany declared a region including present-day Togo as a protectorate called Togoland . After World War I , rule over Togo was transferred to France . Togo gained its independence from France in 1960 . In 1967 , Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma led a successful military coup d'\u00e9tat after which he became president of an anti-communist , single-party state .

Efik oral histories tell of migration down the Cross River from Arochukwu to found numerous settlements in the Calabar and Creek Town area . Creek Town and its environs are often commonly referred to as Calabar , and its people as Calabar people , after the European name Calabar Kingdom given to the state [ in present-day Cross River State . Calabar is not to be confused with the Kalabari Kingdom in Rivers State which is an Ijaw state to its west . Cross River State with Akwa Ibom State was formerly one of the original twelve states of Nigeria known as the Southeastern State . The Efik people also occupy southwestern Cameroon including Bakassi . This area , formerly a trust territory from German Cameroon , was administered as a part of the Eastern Region of Nigeria until it achieved autonomy in 1954 , thus separating the Efik people politically . This separation was further extended when as a result of a 1961 plebiscite the area voted to join the Republic of Cameroon . Most of the area was immediately transferred , but in August 2006 - Nigeria handed over the Bakassi peninsula to Cameroon .",

It was effectively formed in 1916 by the splitting of the German protectorate of Togoland into two territories , French Togoland and British Togoland , during the First World War . Initially , it was a League of Nations Class B mandate . In 1922 , British Togoland was formally placed under British rule while French Togoland , now Togo , was placed under French rule . Following the Second World War , the political status of British Togoland changed - it became a United Nations Trust Territory , although still administered by the United Kingdom . During the decolonization of Africa , a plebiscite was organised in British Togoland in May 1956 to decide the future of the territory . A majority of voters taking part voted to merge the territory with the neighbouring Gold Coast , a British Crown colony . On 13 December 1956 , the United Nations General Assembly passed General Assembly resolution 1044 on The future of Togoland under British administration . By that resolution , the UN acknowledged the outcome of the plebiscite held in the Territory which was a majority in favour of unity with Gold Coast . The resolution recommended that the United Kingdom effect the union of Togoland ( British ) with Gold Coast upon the independence of Gold Coast . In a letter dated 6 March 1957 the United Kingdom Government informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations that with effect from midnight 6 March 1957 , under the terms of the Ghana Independence Act 1956 , the territories previously comprised in the Gold Coast became the independent State of Ghana and that under the same Act , the union of the former Trust Territory of Togoland under British administration with the independent State of Ghana took place from the same time and date .

During the period known as the Scramble for Africa , the colony was established in 1884 and was gradually extended inland .

The Fon people traditionally were a culture of an oral tradition and had a well-developed polytheistic religious system . They were noted by early 19th-century European traders for their N'Nonmiton practice or Dahomey Amazons - which empowered their women to serve in the military , who decades later fought the French colonial forces in 1890 . Most Fon today live in villages and small towns in mud houses with corrugated iron gable roofs . Cities built by the Fon include Abomey , the historical capital city of Dahomey on what was historically referred to by Europeans as the Slave Coast .
