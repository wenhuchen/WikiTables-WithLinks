  "/wiki/Attending_physician": "In the United States and Canada , an attending physician ( also known as an attending , rendering doc , or staff physician ) is a physician ( M.D . or D.O . ) who has completed residency and practices medicine in a clinic or hospital , in the specialty learned during residency . An attending physician typically supervises fellows , residents , medical students , and other practitioners . Attending physicians may also maintain professorships at an affiliated medical school . This is common if the supervision of trainees is a significant part of the physician 's work . Attending physicians have final responsibility , legally and otherwise , for patient care , even when many of the minute-to-minute decisions are being made by house officers ( residents ) or Advanced Practice Providers ( i.e . physician assistants and nurse practitioners ) . Attending physicians are sometimes the 'rendering physician ' listed on the patient 's official medical record , but if they are overseeing a resident or another staff member , they are 'supervising . ' Attending physicians may also still be in training , such as a fellow in a subspecialty . For example , a cardiology fellow may function as an internal medicine attending , as he or she has already finished residency in internal medicine .

Its title became the name of the organization and is now usually referred to as The Big Book . AA 's initial Twelve Traditions were introduced in 1946 to help the fellowship be stable and unified while disengaged from outside issues and influences . The Traditions recommend that members remain anonymous in public media , altruistically help other alcoholics , and that AA groups avoid official affiliations with other organizations . They also advise against dogma and coercive hierarchies . Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes .
