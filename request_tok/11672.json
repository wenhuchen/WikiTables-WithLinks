  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",

  "/wiki/Fractional_ownership_of_aircraft": "Fractional Aircraft is a common term for fractional ownership of aircraft where multiple owners share the costs of purchasing , leasing and operating the aircraft . Commercial programs for large aircraft include NetJets , Flexjet , PlaneSense , and AirSprint . With fractional jets , customers ( referred to as owners ) buy a share of an aircraft , rather than an entire aircraft . The price is pro-rated from the market price of a full aircraft . Owners then have guaranteed access ( for 50-400 hours annually or a certain number of days of the year , depending on share size ) to that plane , or a similar plane in the operators fleet , with as little as four hours ' notice . Fractional owners pay a monthly maintenance fee and an occupied hourly operating fee . Usually the latter is charged only when an owner or guest is on board , not when the plane is flying to a pick up point , or returning to its home base after completing a flight . Owners have access to the full fleet of planes and may upgrade or downgrade for specific flights . At the end of the contract the owner can sell their share either back to the company or to another owner waiting for a position , though most companies charge a re-marketing fee to do this . In addition , similar agreements are made for individual light , general aviation aircraft , where several individuals will purchase and operate their chosen aircraft as an independent group , without going through a commercial operator . If one individual decides sell their share , their shares may then be purchased by the remaining owners or sold outside the group to another individual . As it is subject to whatever terms were in the original contract , the details will vary from group to group .",
