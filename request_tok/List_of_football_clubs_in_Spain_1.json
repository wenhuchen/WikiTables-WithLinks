In Soria was born Alfonso VIII , and Alfonso X had his court established when he received the offer to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire . In Soria , the deposed king James IV of Mallorca died , and John I of Castile married . Booming during the Late Middle Ages thanks to its border location and its control over the bovine industry , Soria went into a slow decline over the next few centuries .
