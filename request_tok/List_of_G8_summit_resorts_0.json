Before his accession to the presidency , Ford served as the 40th vice president of the United States from December 1973 to August 1974 . Ford is the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office by the Electoral College . Born in Omaha , Nebraska , and raised in Grand Rapids , Michigan , Ford attended the University of Michigan and Yale Law School . After the attack on Pearl Harbor , he enlisted in the U.S . Naval Reserve , serving from 1942 to 1946 ; he left as a lieutenant commander . Ford began his political career in 1949 as the U.S. representative from Michigan 's 5th congressional district .

It had formed from the Group of Seven after excluding the country of Russia , and resumed operating under that name after Russia was disinvited in 2014 . The forum originated with a 1975 summit hosted by France that brought together representatives of six governments : France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom , and the United States , thus leading to the name Group of Six or G6 . The summit came to be known as the Group of Seven , or G7 , in 1976 with the addition of Canada . Russia with a huge financial and economic weight was added to the political forum from 1997 , which the following year became known as the G8 . In March 2014 Russia was suspended indefinitely following the annexation of Crimea , whereupon the political forum name reverted to G7 . In 2017 Russia announced its permanent withdrawal from the G8 . However , several representatives of G7 countries stated that they would be interested in Russia 's return to the group . The European Union was represented at the G8 since the 1980s as a nonenumerated participant , but originally could not host or chair summits . The 40th summit was the first time the European Union was able to host and chair a summit .

  "/wiki/Concorde": "The A\u00e9rospatiale/BAC Concorde ( /\u02c8k\u0252\u014bk\u0254\u02d0rd/ ) is a British-French turbojet-powered supersonic passenger airliner that was operated until 2003 . It had a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound , at Mach 2.04 ( 1,354 mph or 2,180 km/h at cruise altitude ) , with seating for 92 to 128 passengers . First flown in 1969 , Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued flying for the next 27 years . It is one of only two supersonic transports to have been operated commercially ; the other is the Soviet-built Tupolev Tu-144 , which operated in the late 1970s . Concorde was jointly developed and manufactured by Sud Aviation ( later A\u00e9rospatiale ) and the British Aircraft Corporation ( BAC ) under an Anglo-French treaty . Twenty aircraft were built , including six prototypes and development aircraft . Air France ( AF ) and British Airways ( BA ) were the only airlines to purchase and fly Concorde . The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for the aircraft 's speed and luxury service . For example , in 1997 , the round-trip ticket price from New York to London was $ 7,995 ( $ 12.7 thousand in 2019 dollars ) , more than 30 times the cost of the cheapest option to fly this route . The original programme cost estimate of \u00a370 million met huge overruns and delays , with the program eventually costing \u00a31.3 billion . It was this extreme cost that became the main factor in the production run being much smaller than anticipated . Later , another factor , which affected the viability of all supersonic transport programmes , was that supersonic flight could only be used on ocean-crossing routes , to prevent sonic boom disturbance over populated areas .",
  "/wiki/Air_Force_One": "Air Force One is the official air traffic control call sign for a United States Air Force aircraft carrying the president of the United States . In common parlance , the term is used to denote U.S. Air Force aircraft modified and used to transport the president . The aircraft are prominent symbols of the American presidency and its power . The idea of designating specific military aircraft to transport the President arose in 1943 , when officials of the United States Army Air Forces , the predecessor to the U.S. Air Force , became concerned about using commercial airlines for presidential travel . A C-87 Liberator Express was reconfigured for use as the first dedicated VIP-and-presidential transport aircraft and named Guess Where II , but the Secret Service rejected it because of its safety record . A C-54 Skymaster was then converted for presidential use ; dubbed the Sacred Cow , it carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in February 1945 and was used for another two years by President Harry S. Truman . The Air Force One call sign was created in 1953 , after a Lockheed Constellation named Columbine II carrying President Dwight D. Eisenhower entered the same airspace as a commercial airline flight using the same flight number . Other Air Force Ones have included another Lockheed Constellation , Columbine III , and two Boeing 707s , introduced in the 1960s and 1970s . Since 1990 , the presidential fleet has consisted of two Boeing VC-25As : highly customized Boeing 747-200B aircraft .

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada 's third longest-serving Prime Minister , behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald . Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer , intellectual , and activist in Quebec politics . He joined the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965 , quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson 's Parliamentary Secretary . In 1967 , he was appointed Minister of Justice . Trudeau 's outgoing personality caused a media sensation , inspiring Trudeaumania , and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968 , when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada .

He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards , in 1980 , and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election . Despite his personal motto , Reason before passion , his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office . Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau 's intellect and his political acumen , maintaining national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement , suppressing a Quebec terrorist crisis , fostering a pan-Canadian identity , and in achieving sweeping institutional reform , including the implementation of official bilingualism , patriation of the Constitution , and the establishment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

The only major roads crossing the hills pass through Glen Devon/Glen Eagles and Glenfarg , the latter now largely replaced except for local traffic by the M90 Edinburgh-Perth motorway cutting through the eastern foothills . The hills are part of a Devonian lava extrusion whose appearance today is largely due to the Ochil Fault which results in the southern face of the hills forming an escarpment . The plateau is undulating with no prominent peak , the highest point being Ben Cleuch at 721 m ( 2,365 ft ) . The south-flowing burns have cut deep ravines including Dollar Glen , Silver Glen and Alva Glen , often only passable with the aid of wooden walkways . The extent of the Ochils is not well-defined but by some definitions continues to include the hills of north Fife . Historically , the hills , combined with the town 's site at the lowest bridging-point on the River Forth , led to Stirling 's importance as a main gateway to the Highlands . They also acted as a boundary with Fife . Castle Campbell was built at the head of Dollar Glen in the late 15th century ( an earlier castle on the site had been called Castle Gloom ) mainly as a very visible symbol of the Campbell domination of the area .

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .

An island may be described as such , despite the presence of an artificial land bridge ; examples are Singapore and its causeway , and the various Dutch delta islands , such as IJsselmonde . Some places may even retain island in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill , such as Coney Island and Coronado Island , though these are , strictly speaking , tied islands . Conversely , when a piece of land is separated from the mainland by a man-made canal , for example the Peloponnese by the Corinth Canal , more or less the entirety of Fennoscandia by the White Sea Canal , or Marble Hill in northern Manhattan during the time between the building of the United States Ship Canal and the filling-in of the Harlem River which surrounded the area , it is generally not considered an island .
