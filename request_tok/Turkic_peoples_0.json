  "/wiki/Turkish_people": "Turkish people or the Turks ( Turkish : T\u00fcrkler ) , also known as Anatolian Turks ( Turkish : Anadolu T\u00fcrkleri ) , are a Turkic ethnic group and nation living mainly in Turkey and speaking Turkish , the most widely spoken Turkic language . They are the largest ethnic group in Turkey , as well as by far the largest ethnic group among the speakers of Turkic languages . Ethnic Turkish minorities exist in the former lands of the Ottoman Empire . In addition , a Turkish diaspora has been established with modern migration , particularly in Western Europe . Turks arrived from Central Asia and Western China and settled in the Anatolian basin in around the 11th century through the conquest of Seljuk Turks , mixing with the peoples of Anatolia . The region then began to transform from a predominately Greek Christian one to a Turkish Muslim society . Thereafter , the Ottoman Empire came to rule much of the Balkans , the Caucasus , the Middle East ( excluding Iran ) , and North Africa over the course of several centuries , with an advanced army and navy . The Empire lasted until the end of the First World War , when it was defeated by the Allies and partitioned . Following the successful Turkish War of Independence that ended with the Turkish national movement retaking most of the land lost to the Allies , the movement abolished the Ottoman sultanate on 1 November 1922 and proclaimed the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923 . Not all Ottomans were Muslims and not all Ottoman Muslims were Turks , but by 1923 , the majority of people living within the borders of the new Turkish republic identified as Turks . Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a Turk as anyone who is bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship ; therefore , the legal use of the term Turkish as a citizen of Turkey is different from the ethnic definition . However , the majority of the Turkish population are of Turkish ethnicity and are estimated at 70-75 percent .",

East Thrace , the part of Turkey in Europe , is separated from Anatolia by the Sea of Marmara , the Bosporus and the Dardanelles ( collectively called the Turkish Straits ) . Istanbul , mostly located on the European side , is the largest city in the country while Ankara is the capital . Turkey is bordered by Greece and Bulgaria to its northwest , the Black Sea to its north , Georgia to its northeast , Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to its east , Iraq and Syria to its southeast , the Mediterranean Sea to its south , and the Aegean Sea to its west . Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",

Outside Turkey , significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany , Austria , Bulgaria , North Macedonia , Northern Cyprus , Greece , the Caucasus , and other parts of Europe and Central Asia . Cyprus has requested that the European Union add Turkish as an official language , even though Turkey is not a member state . To the west , the influence of Ottoman Turkish - the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire - spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded . In 1928 , as one of Atat\u00fcrk 's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey , the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet . The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination . The basic word order of Turkish is subject-object-verb . Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender . The language makes usage of honorifics and has a strong T-V distinction which distinguishes varying levels of politeness , social distance , age , courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee . The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect .",

They are the second-most numerous ethnic group among the Turkic peoples after Turkish people and predominantly Shia Muslims . They comprise the largest ethnic group in the Republic of Azerbaijan and the second-largest ethnic group in neighboring Iran and Georgia . The world 's largest number of ethnic Azerbaijanis live in Iran , followed by the Republic of Azerbaijan . They speak the Azerbaijani language , belonging to the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages . The Azerbaijanis of Iran are believed to be descended from various groups , including Mannaeans , an ancient people who lived in the territory of present-day northwestern Iran to the south of Lake Urmia at around the 10th to 7th centuries BC , and spoke a dialect related to Hurrian ( a non-Semitic and non-Indo-European language related to Urartian ) , and the Medes , an ancient Iranian ethnic group which , under the rule of King Cyaxares , established the Median Empire and came to dominate the region . The Median Empire is believed to have conquered and assimilated the Mannaeans by the 6th century BC . Historical research suggests that the Old Azeri language , belonging to the Northwestern branch of the Iranian languages and believed to have descended from the language of the Medes , gradually gained currency and was widely spoken in the said region for many centuries . The Azerbaijanis of the Republic of Azerbaijan are believed to be descended from the inhabitants of Caucasian Albania , an ancient country located in the eastern Caucasus region , and various Iranian peoples which settled the region . There is evidence that , despite repeated invasions and migrations , the aboriginal Caucasian population may have gradually been culturally and linguistically assimilated , first by Iranian peoples , such as the Persians , and later by the Oghuz Turks . Considerable information has been learned about the Caucasian Albanians , including their language , history , early conversion to Christianity , and relations with the Armenians and Georgians , under whose strong religious and cultural influence the Caucasian Albanians came in the coming centuries . Many academics believe that the Udi language , belonging to the Northeast Caucasian languages and still spoken in Azerbaijan , is a remnant of the Caucasian Albanians ' language .",

The name Atropat in Middle Persian was transformed to Adharbad and is connected with Zoroastrianism . A famous Zoroastrian priest by the name Adarbad Mahraspandan is well known for his counsels . Azerbaijan , due to its numerous fire-temples has also been quoted in a variety of historic sources as being the birthplace of the prophet Zoroaster although modern scholars have not yet reached an agreement on the location of his birth . With Qajar Iran being forced to cede to Imperial Russia its Caucasian territories north of the Aras River ( that is , modern-day Georgia , Dagestan , Armenia , and the Republic of Azerbaijan ) during the course of the 19th century , through the treaties of Gulistan ( 1813 ) and Turkmenchay ( 1828 ) , vast amounts of soil were irrevocably lost . Following the disintegration of the Russian Empire in 1917 , as well as the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic , in 1918 , the leading Musavat government adopted the name Azerbaijan for the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic , which was proclaimed on May 27 , 1918 , for political reasons , even though the name of Azerbaijan had always been used to refer to the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran . Thus , until 1918 , when the Musavat regime decided to name the newly independent state Azerbaijan , this designation had been used exclusively to identify the Iranian province of Azerbaijan .",

More recently , however , the term has come to refer more narrowly to related ethnic groups who refer to themselves as Tatars or who speak languages that are commonly referred to as Tatar , namely Tatar by Volga Tatars ( Tatars proper ) , Crimean Tatar by Crimean Tatars and Siberian Tatar by Siberian Tatars . The largest group amongst the Tatars by far and the one called Tatars in Russian , are the Volga Tatars , native to the Volga-Ural region ( Tatarstan and Bashkortostan ) , who for this reason are often also simply known as Tatars .

Kyrgyz is a member of the Kyrgyz-Kipchak subgroup of the Kypchak languages and modern-day language convergence has resulted in an increasing degree of mutual intelligibility between Kazakh and Kyrgyz .

Between 1928 and 1940 a Latin-script alphabet , the Uniform Turkic Alphabet , was used . In 1940 due to general Soviet policy , a Cyrillic alphabet eventually became common and has remained so to this day , though some Kyrgyz still use the Arabic alphabet . When Kyrgyzstan became independent following the Soviet Union 's collapse in 1991 , there was a popular idea among some Kyrgyzstanis to switch to the Latin script , which is still common in some small pockets of the countryside and make the Latin script the countrys official national script ( taking in mind a version closer to the Turkish alphabet rather than the original alphabet of 1928-40 ) .

The Krymchak community was composed of Jewish immigrants who arrived from all over Europe and Asia and who continuously added to the Krymchak population . The Krymchak language , as well as culture and daily life , was similar to Crimean Tatar , the peninsula 's majority population , with the addition of a significant Hebrew influence . Like most Jewish languages , it contains many Hebrew loanwords . Before the Soviet era , it was written using Hebrew characters . In the Soviet Union in the 1930s , it was written with the Uniform Turkic Alphabet ( a variant of the Latin script ) , like Crimean Tatar and Karaim . Now it is written in the Cyrillic script . Over the last century the language has disappeared and been replaced by Russian , with approximately 70% of the population perishing in the Holocaust . When in May 1944 almost all Crimean Tatars were deported to Soviet Uzbekistan , many speakers of Krymchak were among them , and some remained in Uzbekistan . Nowadays the language is almost extinct . According to the Ukrainian census of 2001 , less than 785 Krymchak people remain in Crimea . One estimate supposes that of the approximately 1500-2000 Krymchaks living worldwide , mostly in Israel , Crimea , Russia , and the United States , only 5-7 are native speakers ."
