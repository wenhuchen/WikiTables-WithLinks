  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",
  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume , and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite .",
  "/wiki/Crown_Hill_Cemetery": "Crown Hill Cemetery is a historic rural cemetery located at 700 West Thirty-Eighth Street in Indianapolis , Marion County , Indiana . The privately owned cemetery was established in 1863 at Strawberry Hill , whose summit was renamed The Crown , a high point overlooking Indianapolis . It is approximately 2.8 miles ( 4.5 km ) northwest of the city 's center . Crown Hill was dedicated on June 1 , 1864 , and encompasses 555 acres ( 225 ha ) , making it the third largest non-governmental cemetery in the United States . Its grounds are based on the landscape designs of Pittsburgh landscape architect and cemetery superintendent John Chislett Sr. and Adolph Strauch , a Prussian horticulturalist . In 1866 the U.S. government authorized a U.S. National Cemetery for Indianapolis . The 1.4-acre ( 0.57 ha ) Crown Hill National Cemetery is located in Section 10 . Crown Hill contains 25 miles ( 40 km ) of paved road , over 150 species of trees and plants , over 200,000 graves , and services roughly 1,500 burials per year . [ citation needed ] Crown Hill is the final resting place for individuals from all walks of life , from political and civic leaders to ordinary citizens , infamous criminals , and unknowns . Benjamin Harrison , twenty-third president of the United States , and Vice Presidents Charles W. Fairbanks , Thomas A. Hendricks , and Thomas R. Marshall are buried at Crown Hill . Infamous bank robber and Public Enemy # 1 John Dillinger is another internee . The gravesite of Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley overlooks the city from The Crown .",
  "/wiki/Marble": "Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals , most commonly calcite or dolomite . Marble is typically not foliated , although there are exceptions . In geology , the term marble refers to metamorphosed limestone , but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone . Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material .",
  "/wiki/Limestone": "Limestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral , foraminifera , and molluscs . Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite , which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) . A closely related rock is dolomite , which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite , CaMg ( CO3 ) 2 . In old USGS publications , dolomite was referred to as magnesian limestone , a term now reserved for magnesium-deficient dolomites or magnesium-rich limestones .",

  "/wiki/Glass": "Glass is a non-crystalline , often transparent amorphous solid , that has widespread practical , technological , and decorative use in , for example , window panes , tableware , and optics . Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling ( quenching ) of the molten form , some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring . The most familiar , and historically the oldest , types of manufactured glass are silicate glasses based on the chemical compound silica ( silicon dioxide , or quartz ) , the primary constituent of sand . Soda-lime glass , containing around 70% silica , account for around 90% of manufactured glass . The term glass , in popular usage , is often used to refer only to this type of material , although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology . Some objects , such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses , are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material . Although brittle , silicate glass is extremely durable , and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures . The earliest known glass objects , of the mid third millennium BCE , were beads , perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working ( slags ) or during the production of faience , a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing . Due to its ease of formability into any shape , it has been traditionally used for vessels : bowls , vases , bottles , jars and drinking glasses . In its most solid forms , it has also been used for paperweights , marbles . Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed with vitreous enamels , leading to its use in stained glass windows and other Glass art objects . The refractive , reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses , prisms , and optoelectronics materials ."
