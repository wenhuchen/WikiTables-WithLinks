The weapon was developed specifically for the use of the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger airborne infantry in 1942 and was used in very limited numbers until the end of the war . It combined the characteristics and firepower of a light machine gun in a lightweight form slightly shorter ( but considerably bulkier and heavier ) than the standard-issue Karabiner 98k bolt-action infantry rifle . Considered one of the most advanced weapon designs of World War II , the FG 42 influenced post-war small arms development , and many features of its design , such as general shape , stock style , gas-rotating bolt operation ( itself copied from the Lewis gun ) and sheet metal and plastic construction were copied by the US Army when they developed the M60 machine gun .",

It consisted of the Heer ( army ) , the Kriegsmarine ( navy ) and the Luftwaffe ( air force ) . The designation Wehrmacht replaced the previously used term Reichswehr , and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime 's efforts to rearm Germany to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted . After the Nazi rise to power in 1933 , one of Adolf Hitler 's most overt and audacious moves was to establish the Wehrmacht , a modern offensively-capable armed force , fulfilling the Nazi regime 's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours . This required the reinstatement of conscription , and massive investment and defense spending on the arms industry . The Wehrmacht formed the heart of Germany 's politico-military power . In the early part of the Second World War , the Wehrmacht employed combined arms tactics ( close cover air-support , tanks , and infantry ) to devastating effect in what became known as Blitzkrieg ( lightning war ) . Its campaigns in France ( 1940 ) , the Soviet Union ( 1941 ) , and North Africa ( 1941/42 ) are regarded as acts of boldness . At the same time , the far-flung advances strained the Wehrmacht 's capacity to the breaking point , culminating in the first major defeat in the Battle of Moscow ( 1941 ) ; by late 1942 , Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres . The operational art was no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition , making the Wehrmacht 's weaknesses in strategy , doctrine , and logistics readily apparent . Closely cooperating with the SS and the Einsatzgruppen , the German armed forces committed numerous war crimes , despite later denials and promotion of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht .",

It superseded the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) and the inter-war Reichsmarine ( 1919-1935 ) of the Weimar Republic . The Kriegsmarine was one of three official branches , along with the Heer and the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht , the German armed forces from 1933 to 1945 . In violation of the Treaty of Versailles , the Kriegsmarine grew rapidly during German naval rearmament in the 1930s . The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of submarines . Kriegsmarine ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the Spanish Civil War ( 1936-1939 ) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention , but in reality supported the Nationalists against the Spanish Republicans . In January 1939 , Plan Z was ordered , calling for surface naval parity with the British Royal Navy by 1944 . When World War II broke out in September 1939 , Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building program for submarines ( U-boats ) instead of capital surface warships and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources . The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine ( as for all branches of armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power ) was Adolf Hitler , who exercised his authority through the Oberkommando der Marine . The Kriegsmarine 's most significant ships were the U-boats , most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II . Wolfpacks were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic but this tactic was largely abandoned by May 1943 when U-boat losses mounted .",
  "/wiki/Luftwaffe": "The Luftwaffe [ N 2 ] ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8l\u028aftvaf\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) was the aerial warfare branch of the Wehrmacht during World War II . Germany 's military air arms during World War I , the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte of the Imperial Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of theImperial Navy had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force . During the interwar period , German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in Soviet Union . With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty , the Luftwaffe 's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935 , just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German re-armament and conscription would be announced on 16 March . The Condor Legion , a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War , provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft . Partially as a result of this combat experience , the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated , technologically advanced , and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in 1939 . By the summer of 1939 , the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader ( wings ) . The Luftwaffe also operated Fallschirmj\u00e4ger paratrooper units . The Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940 . During the Battle of Britain , however , despite inflicting severe damage to the RAF 's infrastructure and , during the subsequent Blitz , devastating many British cities , the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission . From 1942 , Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe 's fighter arm . From late 1942 , the Luftwaffe used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise Luftwaffe Field Divisions .",

Its formations included men from Nazi Germany , along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and unoccupied lands . The Waffen-SS grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II , and served alongside the Heer ( regular army ) , Ordnungspolizei ( uniformed police ) and other security units . Originally , it was under the control of the SS F\u00fchrungshauptamt ( SS operational command office ) beneath Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler . With the start of World War II , tactical control was exercised by the High Command of the Armed Forces ( OKW ) , with some units being subordinated to Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS ( Command Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS ) directly under Himmler 's control . Initially , in keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany , membership was open only to people of Germanic origin ( so-called Aryan ancestry ) . The rules were partially relaxed in 1940 , and later the formation of units composed largely or solely of foreign volunteers and conscripts was authorised . These SS units were made up of men mainly from among the nationals of Nazi-occupied Europe . Despite relaxation of the rules , the Waffen-SS was still based on the racist ideology of Nazism , and ethnic Poles ( who were viewed as subhumans ) were specifically barred from the formations . Members of the Waffen-SS were involved in numerous atrocities . At the post-war Nuremberg trials , the Waffen-SS was judged to be a criminal organisation due to its connection to the Nazi Party and direct involvement in numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity .

  "/wiki/Smokeless_powder": "Smokeless powder is the name given to a number of propellants used in firearms and artillery that produce negligible smoke when fired , unlike the gunpowder or black powder they replaced . The term is unique to the United States and is generally not used in other English-speaking countries , which initially used proprietary names such as Ballistite and Cordite but gradually shifted to propellant as the generic term . The basis of the term smokeless is that the combustion products are mainly gaseous , compared to around 55% solid products ( mostly potassium carbonate , potassium sulfate , and potassium sulfide ) for black powder . Despite its name , smokeless powder is not completely free of smoke ; :44 while there may be little noticeable smoke from small-arms ammunition , smoke from artillery fire can be substantial . This article focuses on nitrocellulose formulations , but the term smokeless powder was also used to describe various picrate mixtures with nitrate , chlorate , or dichromate oxidizers during the late 19th century , before the advantages of nitrocellulose became evident . :146-149 Since the 14th century gunpowder was not actually a physical powder , and smokeless powder can be produced only as a pelletized or extruded granular material . [ citation needed ] Smokeless powder allowed the development of modern semi- and fully automatic firearms and lighter breeches and barrels for artillery . Burnt gunpowder leaves a thick , heavy fouling that is hygroscopic and causes rusting of the barrel . The fouling left by smokeless powder exhibits none of these properties ( though some primer compounds can leave hygroscopic salts that have a similar effect ; non-corrosive primer compounds were introduced in the 1920s:21 ) . This makes an autoloading firearm with many moving parts feasible ( which would otherwise jam or seize under heavy black powder fouling ) . Smokeless powders are classified as , typically , division 1.3 explosives under the UN Recommendations on the transportation of Dangerous goods - Model Regulations , regional regulations ( such as ADR ) and national regulations ( such as the United States ' ATF ) . However , they are used as solid propellants ; in normal use , they undergo deflagration rather than detonation .",

It began with a small guard unit known as the Saal-Schutz ( Hall Security ) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich . In 1925 , Heinrich Himmler joined the unit , which had by then been reformed and given its final name .

The StG 44 fulfilled its role effectively , particularly on the Eastern Front , offering a greatly increased volume of fire compared to standard infantry rifles . It came too late to have much effect on the war , but did influence the Soviet AK-47 that was introduced three years after the war concluded . Its influence can still be seen in modern assault rifles .",
