  "/wiki/Ross_and_Cromarty": "Ross and Cromarty ( Scottish Gaelic : Ros agus Cromba ) , sometimes referred to as Ross-shire and Cromartyshire is a variously defined area in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland . There is a registration county and a lieutenancy area in current use , the latter of which is 8,019 square kilometres ( 3,096 square miles ) in extent . Historically there has also been a constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ( 1832 to 1983 ) , a local government county ( 1890 to 1975 ) , a district of the Highland local government region ( 1975 to 1996 ) and a management area of the Highland Council ( 1996 to 2007 ) . The local government county is now divided between two local government areas : the Highland area and Na h-Eileanan Siar ( the Western Isles ) . Ross and Cromarty border Sutherland to the north and Inverness-shire to the south . The county was formed by the uniting of the shires of Ross-shire and Cromartyshire . Both these shires had themselves been formed from the historic province of Ross , out of which the many enclaves and exclaves that formed Cromartyshire were carved out , leaving the remaining area to become Ross-shire . These parcels of land were for many purposes administered as part of Ross-shire rather than Cromartyshire . The county also included the Isle of Lewis , however this is not part of the modern lieutenancy area ( which instead includes the Isle of Skye ) , although Lewis is part of the current registration county ."
