It appeals to an indigenous and non-indigenous preschool audience as proven by the high rating of viewers who tuned into Series 1 in January 2012 . What I love about Yambas Playtime , is that while it is primarily aimed at a young indigenous audience , with its energy , music , and sense of story fun it actually appeals to a much broader demographic . Its enlightening on so many levels , said Cameron Clarke , former screenwriter of Hi 5 .
