  "/wiki/Jordan_Spreader": "A spreader is a type of maintenance equipment designed to spread or shape ballast profiles . The spreader spreads gravel along the railroad ties . The various ploughs , wings and blades of specific spreaders allow them to remove snow , build banks , clean and dig ditches , evenly distribute gravel , as well as trim embankments of brush along the side of the track . Spreaders quickly proved themselves as an extremely economical tool for maintaining trackside drainage ditches and spreading fill dumped beside the track . The operation of the wings was once performed by compressed air , and later hydraulics . Besides the MoW-operation spreaders are also used in open cast mines to clean the tracks from overburden tipped from dump cars .",

  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation , he had a political career which spanned almost half a century . Macdonald was born in Scotland ; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada ( today in eastern Ontario ) . As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston , which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada . By 1857 , he had become premier under the colony 's unstable political system . In 1864 , when no party proved capable of governing for long , Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival , George Brown , that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform . Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences , which resulted in the British North America Act , 1867 and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867 . Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation , and served 19 years ; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer . In 1873 , he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway . However , he was re-elected in 1878 , continuing until he died in office in 1891 . Macdonald 's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion , using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party , promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy , and completing the railway . He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from the national government in Ottawa .",

Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable ( French : Le Tr\u00e8s Honorable ) , a privilege maintained for life . The prime minister of Canada is in charge of the Prime Minister 's Office . The prime minister also chooses the ministers who make up the Cabinet . The two groups , with the authority of the Parliament of Canada , manage the Government of Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces . The Cabinet and the prime minister also appoint members of the Senate of Canada , the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada and other federal courts , and the leaders and boards , as required under law , of various Crown Corporations , and selects the governor general of Canada . Under the Canadian constitution , all of the power to exercise these activities is actually vested in the monarch of Canada , but in practice the monarch ( who is the head of state ) or her representative , the governor general of Canada , approves them routinely , and their role is largely ceremonial , and their powers are only exercised under the advice of the prime minister . Not outlined in any constitutional document , the office exists only as per long-established convention ( originating in Canada 's former colonial power , the United Kingdom ) that stipulates the monarch 's representative , the governor general , must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber .

  "/wiki/Steam_locomotive": "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine . These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material - usually coal , wood , or oil - to produce steam in a boiler . The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive 's main wheels ( drivers ) . Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive , either on the locomotive itself or in wagons ( tenders ) pulled behind . Steam locomotives were first developed in the United Kingdom during the early 19th century and used for railway transport until the middle of the 20th century . Richard Trevithick built the first steam locomotive in 1802 . The first commercially successful steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. , the Salamanca ( locomotive ) , the Locomotion No . 1 , built by George Stephenson and his son Robert 's company Robert Stephenson and Company , was the first steam locomotive to haul passengers on a public railway , the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 . In 1830 , George Stephenson opened the first public inter-city railway , the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . Robert Stephenson and Company was the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives for railways in the United Kingdom , the United States , and much of Europe in the first decades of steam . In the 20th century , Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) Nigel Gresley designed some of the most famous locomotives , including the Flying Scotsman , the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service , and a LNER Class A4 , 4468 Mallard , which still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world ( 126 mph ) . From the early 1900s , steam locomotives were gradually superseded by electric and diesel locomotives , with railways fully converting to electric and diesel power beginning in the late 1930s .",
  "/wiki/Connaught_Tunnel": "The Connaught Tunnel is a railway tunnel under the Selkirk Mountains in southeastern British Columbia , Canada , near the city of Revelstoke . The 5.022-mile ( 8.082 km ) tunnel carries the Canadian Pacific Railway main line under Mount Macdonald and replaced the railway 's previous routing over Rogers Pass , which had been struck by several deadly avalanches since its completion in 1885 . At the time it was built , the Connaught Tunnel was the longest railway tunnel in North America . It was named for the Governor General of Canada-the Prince Arthur , Duke of Connaught-who in turn was named after the province of Connaught in Ireland . Announced in February 1913 , the contract was awarded on July 1 , 1913 , to Foley Bros. Welch and Stewart . The tunnel was designed by John G. Sullivan who joined the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1900 and eventually became Chief Engineer for Canada . A small tunnel was built , from which cross cuts were made to the main tunnel so work could carry on at a number of headings . The sub-contractor guaranteed to drill 900 feet ( 270 m ) of tunnel per month and started on April 2 , 1914 . Compressed air equipment and narrow gauge locomotives were used inside the tunnel . The company town housed some 300 workers . The tunnel was completed before the original deadline , with operation beginning December 16 , 1916 . It had a grade of only 0.95 per cent westward , and was tangent ; light at one end can be seen at the other , more than five miles away .",

It is also considered by some [ quantify ] to be a northern subcontinent of the Americas . It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean , to the east by the Atlantic Ocean , to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean , and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea . North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers ( 9,540,000 square miles ) , about 16.5% of the earth 's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface . North America is the third largest continent by area , following Asia and Africa , and the fourth by population after Asia , Africa , and Europe . In 2013 , its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states , or about 7.5% of the world 's population , if nearby islands ( most notably around the Caribbean ) are included . North America was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period , via crossing the Bering land bridge approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago . The so-called Paleo-Indian period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago ( the beginning of the Archaic or Meso-Indian period ) . The Classic stage spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries . The Pre-Columbian era ended in 1492 , with the beginning of the transatlantic migrations - the arrival of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the Early Modern period .

The RPO was staffed by highly trained Railway Mail Service postal clerks , and was off-limits to the passengers on the train . In the UK and Ireland , the equivalent term was Travelling Post Office ( TPO ) . From the middle of the 19th century , many American railroads earned substantial revenues through contracts with the U.S. Post Office Department ( USPOD ) to carry mail aboard high-speed passenger trains ; and the Railway Mail Service enforced various standardized designs on RPOs . In fact , a number of companies maintained passenger routes where the financial losses from moving people were more than offset by transporting the mail .",
  "/wiki/Niagara_Falls_Suspension_Bridge": "The Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge stood from 1855 to 1897 across the Niagara River and was the world 's first working railway suspension bridge . It spanned 825 feet ( 251 m ) and stood 2.5 miles ( 4.0 km ) downstream of Niagara Falls , where it connected Niagara Falls , Ontario to Niagara Falls , New York . Trains used the upper of its two decks , while pedestrians and carriages used the lower . The bridge was the idea of Canadian politicians , and it was built by an American company and a Canadian company . It was most commonly called the Suspension Bridge , although other names included Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge , Niagara Suspension Bridge , and its official American name of the International Suspension Bridge . The bridge was part of Canadian politician William Hamilton Merritt 's vision to promote trade within his country and with its neighbor the United States . Many argued that a suspension bridge could not support the safe passage of trains , including bridge builders . Nonetheless , the bridge companies hired Charles Ellet , Jr. , who laid a line by a kite across the 800-foot ( 240 m ) chasm and built a temporary suspension bridge in 1848 . Ellet left the project after a financial dispute with the bridge companies , who hired John Augustus Roebling to complete the project . By 1854 , his bridge was nearly complete , and the lower deck was opened for pedestrian and carriage travel . On March 18 , 1855 , a fully laden passenger train officially opened the completed bridge . The Suspension Bridge was a border crossing between Canada and the United States , and it played significant roles in the histories of the Niagara region and the two countries .",

It was founded in 1833 , received its enabling Act of Parliament on 31 August 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838 . It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel , who chose a broad gauge of 7 ft ( 2,134 mm ) - later slightly widened to 7 ft 1\u20444 in ( 2,140 mm ) - but , from 1854 , a series of amalgamations saw it also operate 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard-gauge trains ; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892 . The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921 , which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory , and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways . The GWR was called by some God 's Wonderful Railway and by others the Great Way Round but it was famed as the Holiday Line , taking many people to English and Bristol Channel resorts in the West Country as well as the far southwest of England such as Torquay in Devon , Minehead in Somerset , and Newquay and St Ives in Cornwall . The company 's locomotives , many of which were built in the company 's workshops at Swindon , were painted a Brunswick green colour while , for most of its existence , it used a two-tone chocolate and cream livery for its passenger coaches . Goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid-grey . Great Western trains included long-distance express services such as the Flying Dutchman , the Cornish Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express . It also operated many suburban and rural services , some operated by steam railmotors or autotrains . The company pioneered the use of larger , more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain .

Following the completion of the Pacific Railroad Surveys in 1855 , several national proposals to build a transcontinental railroad failed because of the energy consumed by political disputes over slavery . With the secession of the South in 1861 , the modernizers in the Republican Party controlled the US Congress . They passed legislation in 1862 authorizing the central rail route with financing in the form of land grants and government railroad bond , which were all eventually repaid with interest .

The rail line was built by three private companies over public lands provided by extensive US land grants . Construction was financed by both state and US government subsidy bonds as well as by company issued mortgage bonds . [ N 1 ] The Western Pacific Railroad Company built 132 mi ( 212 km ) of track from the road 's western terminus at Alameda/Oakland to Sacramento , California . The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California ( CPRR ) constructed 690 mi ( 1,110 km ) eastward from Sacramento to Promontory Summit , Utah Territory . The Union Pacific built 1,085 mi ( 1,746 km ) from the road 's eastern terminus at Council Bluffs near Omaha , Nebraska westward to Promontory Summit . The railroad opened for through traffic between Sacramento and Omaha on May 10 , 1869 , when CPRR President Leland Stanford ceremonially tapped the gold Last Spike ( later often referred to as the Golden Spike ) with a silver hammer at Promontory Summit . In the following six months , the last leg from Sacramento to San Francisco Bay was completed . The resulting coast-to-coast railroad connection revolutionized the settlement and economy of the American West . It brought the western states and territories into alignment with the northern Union states and made transporting passengers and goods coast-to-coast considerably quicker , safer and less expensive . Paddle steamers linked Sacramento to the cities and their harbor facilities in the San Francisco Bay until late 1869 , when the CPRR completed and opened the Western Pacific portion ( which the CPRR had acquired control of in 1867-68 [ N 2 ] [ N 3 ] ) to Alameda first and then to Oakland . The first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad 's original western terminus at the Alameda Terminal on September 6 , 1869 , where they transferred to the steamer Alameda for transport across the Bay to San Francisco ."
