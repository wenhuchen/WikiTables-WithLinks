  "/wiki/Jonathan_Haidt": "Jonathan David Haidt ( /ha\u026at/ ; born October 19 , 1963 ) is an American social psychologist , Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University 's Stern School of Business , and author . His main areas of study are the psychology of morality and the moral emotions . Haidt 's main scientific contributions come from the psychological field of moral foundations theory . The theory attempts to explain the evolutionary origins of human moral reasoning on the basis of innate , gut feelings rather than logical reason . The theory was later extended to explain the different moral reasoning and how they relate to political ideology , with different political orientations prioritizing different sets of morals . The research served as a foundation for future books on various topics . Haidt has written three books for general audiences . The Happiness Hypothesis : Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom ( 2006 ) explores the relationship between ancient philosophies and modern science . The Righteous Mind : Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion ( 2012 ) examines how morality is shaped by emotion and intuition more than by reasoning , and why differing political groups have different notions of right and wrong . The Coddling of the American Mind : How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure ( 2018 ) , co-written with Greg Lukianoff , explores the rising political polarization and changing culture on college campuses , and its effects on mental health . Haidt has attracted both support and criticism for his critique of the current state of universities and his interpretation of progressive values . He has been named one of the top global thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine , and one of the top world thinkers by Prospect magazine .",
