  "/wiki/Greed_(1924_film)": "Greed is a 1924 American silent film , written and directed by Erich von Stroheim and based on the 1899 Frank Norris novel McTeague . It stars Gibson Gowland as Dr. John McTeague , ZaSu Pitts as Trina Sieppe , his wife , and Jean Hersholt as McTeague 's friend and eventual enemy Marcus Schouler . The film tells the story of McTeague , a San Francisco dentist , who marries his best friend Schouler 's girlfriend Trina . Greed was one of the few films of its time to be shot entirely on location , with Stroheim shooting approximately 85 hours of footage before editing . Two months alone were spent shooting in Death Valley for the film 's final sequence , and many of the cast and crew became ill. Stroheim used sophisticated filming techniques such as deep-focus cinematography and montage editing . He considered Greed to be a Greek tragedy , in which environment and heredity controlled the characters ' fates and reduced them to primitive b\u00eates humaines ( human beasts ) , a naturalistic concept in the vein of Zola . During editing on Greed , the production company merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , putting Irving Thalberg in charge of the film 's post-production . Thalberg had fired Stroheim a few years earlier at Universal Pictures . Originally almost eight hours long , Greed was edited against Stroheim 's wishes to about two-and-a-half hours . Only twelve people saw the full-length 42-reel version , now lost ; some of them called it the greatest film ever made . Stroheim later called Greed his most fully realized work and was hurt both professionally and personally by the studio 's re-editing of it . The uncut version has been called the holy grail for film archivists , amid repeated false claims of the discovery of the missing footage .",

His masterpiece adaptation of Frank Norris 's McTeague titled Greed is considered one of the finest and most important films ever made . After clashes with Hollywood studio bosses over budget and workers ' rights issues , Stroheim was banned for life as a director and subsequently became a well-respected character actor , particularly in French cinema . For his early innovations as a director , Stroheim is still celebrated as one of the first of the auteur directors . He helped introduce more sophisticated plots and noirish sexual and psychological undercurrents into cinema . He died in 1957 in France of prostate cancer at the age of 71 . Beloved by Parisian neo-Surrealists known as Letterists , he was honored by Letterist Maurice Lemaitre with a 70-minute 1979 film entitled Erich von Stroheim .",

  "/wiki/Freaks_(1932_film)": "Freaks is a 1932 American pre-Code horror film produced and directed by Tod Browning , and starring Wallace Ford , Leila Hyams , Olga Baclanova and Roscoe Ates . It follows a trapeze artist who joins a group of carnival sideshow performers with a plan to seduce and murder a dwarf in the troupe to gain his inheritance , but her plot proves to have dangerous consequences . The film is based on elements from the short story Spurs by Tod Robbins . Filmed in Los Angeles in the fall of 1931 , Freaks was given test screenings in January 1932 that received harsh reaction from audiences , who found the film too grotesque . In response to this , the 90-minute feature was significantly cut , and additional alternate footage was incorporated to help increase the running time . The final abridged cut of the film , released in February 1932 , runs only 64 minutes ; the original version no longer exists . Despite the cuts made to the film , Freaks still garnered notice due to the fact that its eponymous characters were portrayed by people who worked as sideshow performers and had real disabilities . These cast members included dwarf siblings Harry and Daisy Earles , Johnny Eck who had sacral agenenis , the conjoined twin sisters Daisy and Violet Hilton , and Schlitzie , a man with microcephaly . Because of its controversial content , the film was banned in the United Kingdom for over 30 years and was labelled as brutal and grotesque in Canada . Though it received critical backlash and was a box-office failure upon initial release , Freaks was subject to public and critical reappraisal in the 1960s , particularly in Europe , and was screened at the 1962 Venice Film Festival . It was also shown frequently throughout the United States as a midnight movie . Some film scholars have interpreted the film as a metaphor for class conflict , reflecting the Great Depression .",

  "/wiki/The_Road_Back_(film)": "The Road Back is a 1937 American drama war film directed by James Whale , starring John King , Richard Cromwell , and Slim Summerville . The screenplay is by Charles Kenyon and R. C. Sherriff from the novel of the same name by Erich Maria Remarque . Combining a strong anti-war message with prescient warnings about the rising dangers of the dictatorship of Nazi Germany , it was intended to be a powerful and controversial picture , and Universal entrusted it to their finest director , James Whale . The novel on which the film is based was banned during Nazi rule . When the film was made , Universal Pictures was threatened with a boycott of all their films by the German government unless the anti-Nazi sentiments in the script were watered down . Carl Laemmle and his son , Carl Laemmle , Jr. , the former heads of Universal , had recently been ousted by a corporate takeover . The new studio heads , fearing financial loss , caved in to Nazi pressure and the film was partially reshot with another director , and the remainder extensively re-edited , leaving it a pale shadow of Whale 's original intentions . To the director 's further displeasure , writer Charles Kenyon was ordered to interject the script with comedy scenes between Andy Devine and Slim Summerville , which Whale found unsuitable . Disgusted with the studio 's cowardice under its new management , Whale left Universal after completing Wives Under Suspicion , an unsuccessful remake of his own The Kiss Before the Mirror . He returned two years later to direct Green Hell , but never made another film for Universal after that . In the film Gods and Monsters , Whale ( played by Ian McKellen ) speaks of his hatred of making The Road Back , the film he intended to be the crowning achievement of his career .",

It was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later , and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years . It is also the third film of Leone 's Once Upon a Time Trilogy , which includes Once Upon a Time in the West ( 1968 ) and Duck , You Sucker ! ( 1971 ) . The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli , and the film score by Ennio Morricone . Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films , then a single 269-minute ( 4 hours and 29 minutes ) version , but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes ( 3 hours and 49 minutes ) . The American distributors , The Ladd Company , further shortened it to 139 minutes , and rearranged the scenes into chronological order , without Leone 's involvement . The shortened version was a critical and commercial flop in the United States , and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes that were made . The original European cut has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest gangster films of all time .",

  "/wiki/The_Ladd_Company": "The Ladd Company was an American film production company founded by Alan Ladd , Jr. , Jay Kanter , and Gareth Wigan in 1979 . In 1979 , the three founders were executives with 20th Century Fox ; Ladd was the president . They announced their intention to leave the company when their contracts expired in December 1980 and form a new production company to be financed by Warner Bros. ( Ladd had reportedly been quarreling with other Fox senior executives . ) Fox subsequently cut their contracts short , ending on October 1 , 1979 . The day after the contracts expired , the trio placed ads for the newly named Ladd Company in The Hollywood Reporter and Variety . Under Warner Bros. , The Ladd Company distributed Chariots of Fire , which won the 1981 Academy Award for Best Picture . Among the films it produced were the Space Race epic The Right Stuff , the space western Outland , Ridley Scott 's science-fiction cult film Blade Runner , neo-noir film Body Heat , and the first two Police Academy movies . Police Academy proved very profitable . But the returns from the company 's successes did not outweigh the box-office failures of The Right Stuff , the edited version of Sergio Leone 's Once Upon a Time in America , and the animated Twice Upon a Time ( co-produced with Lucasfilm ) . On April 18 , 1984 , Alan Ladd , Jr. and Warner Bros. parted ways , even though the former still had three years left on the studio 's contract .

  "/wiki/Brazil_(1985_film)": "Brazil is a 1985 dystopian science fiction film directed by Terry Gilliam and written by Gilliam , Charles McKeown , and Tom Stoppard . The film stars Jonathan Pryce and features Robert De Niro , Kim Greist , Michael Palin , Katherine Helmond , Bob Hoskins and Ian Holm . The film centres on Sam Lowry , a man trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living in a small apartment , set in a dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly maintained ( and rather whimsical ) machines . Brazil 's satire of bureaucratic , totalitarian government is reminiscent of George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four and has been called Kafkaesque and absurdist . Sarah Street 's British National Cinema ( 1997 ) describes the film as a fantasy/satire on bureaucratic society ; and John Scalzi 's Rough Guide to Sci-Fi Movies ( 2005 ) describes it as a dystopian satire . Jack Mathews , a film critic and the author of The Battle of Brazil ( 1987 ) , described the film as satirizing the bureaucratic , largely dysfunctional industrial world that had been driving Gilliam crazy all his life . The film is named after the recurrent theme song , Ary Barroso 's Aquarela do Brasil , known simply as Brazil to British audiences , as performed by Geoff Muldaur . Though a success in Europe , the film was unsuccessful in its initial North America release . It has since become a cult film . In 1999 , the British Film Institute voted Brazil the 54th greatest British film of all time . In 2017 a poll of 150 actors , directors , writers , producers and critics for Time Out magazine saw it ranked the 24th best British film ever .",
