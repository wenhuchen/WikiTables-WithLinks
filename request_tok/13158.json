  "/wiki/Governor_of_New_South_Wales": "The Governor of New South Wales is the viceregal representative of the Australian monarch , Queen Elizabeth II , in the state of New South Wales . In an analogous way to the Governor-General of Australia at the national level , the Governors of the Australian states perform constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level .

The current governor is retired judge Margaret Beazley , who succeeded David Hurley on 2 May 2019 . The office has its origin in the 18th-century colonial governors of New South Wales upon its settlement in 1788 , and is the oldest continuous institution in Australia . The present incarnation of the position emerged with the Federation of Australia and the New South Wales Constitution Act 1902 , which defined the viceregal office as the governor acting by and with the advice of the Executive Council of New South Wales . However , the post still ultimately represented the government of the United Kingdom until , after continually decreasing involvement by the British government , the passage in 1942 of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 ( see Statute of Westminster ) and the Australia Act 1986 , after which the governor became the direct , personal representative of the uniquely Australian sovereign .",

  "/wiki/Administrator_of_the_Northern_Territory": "The Administrator of the Northern Territory is an official appointed by the Governor-General of Australia to represent the government of the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory . He or she performs functions similar to those of a state governor . Strictly speaking , the appointment of an Administrator is made by the Governor-General-in-Council , that is , the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Commonwealth Government , rather than the advice of the Government of the Northern Territory . The Northern Territory received self-government on 1 July 1978 , in accordance with the provisions of the Northern Territory ( Self-Government ) Act 1978 ( Cth ) . Since then , the practice has arisen that in making an appointment the Governor-General-in-Council will act on the recommendation of the Northern Territory Government . Unlike an Australian State Governor , the Administrator is not the direct representative of the Queen in the Territory but is instead appointed by the Queen 's representative in the Commonwealth , the Governor-General , to administer the Territory in accordance with the Act . In practice , however , the Administrator performs a similar constitutional role to that of a state governor and can be considered the Queen 's indirect representative in the Territory . The Administrator formally appoints the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and the members of the Cabinet after every election . In all but a few cases , he or she is required by convention to act on the Cabinet 's advice . The Administrator gives royal assent to all bills passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly . Although the Governor-General ( in practice , the Commonwealth Government ) has the power to veto any territorial bill , in practice this right is almost never exercised . The office of the Deputy of the Administrator was created in 1997 .",
