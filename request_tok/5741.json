  "/wiki/Photomosaic": "In the field of photographic imaging , a photographic mosaic , also known under the term Photomosaic , a portmanteau of photo and mosaic , is a picture ( usually a photograph ) that has been divided into ( usually equal sized ) tiled sections , each of which is replaced with another photograph that matches the target photo . When viewed at low magnifications , the individual pixels appear as the primary image , while close examination reveals that the image is in fact made up of many hundreds or thousands of smaller images . Most of the time they are a computer-created type of montage . There are two kinds of mosaic , depending on how the matching is done . In the simpler kind , each part of the target image is averaged down to a single color . Each of the library images is also reduced to a single color . Each part of the target image is then replaced with one from the library where these colors are as similar as possible . In effect , the target image is reduced in resolution ( by downsampling ) , and then each of the resulting pixels is replaced with an image whose average color matches that pixel . In the more advanced kind of photographic mosaic , the target image is not downsampled , and the matching is done by comparing each pixel in the rectangle to the corresponding pixel from each library image . The rectangle in the target is then replaced with the library image that minimizes the total difference . This requires much more computation than the simple kind , but the results can be much better since the pixel-by-pixel matching can preserve the resolution of the target image . Originally , the term photomosaic referred to compound photographs created by stitching together a series of adjacent pictures of a scene .",
