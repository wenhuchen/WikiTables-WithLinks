With an area of 70,550.19 square kilometres ( 27,200 sq mi ) , Bavaria is the largest German state by land area comprising roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany . With 13 million inhabitants , it is Germany 's second-most-populous state after North Rhine-Westphalia . Bavaria 's main cities are Munich ( its capital and largest city and also the third largest city in Germany ) , Nuremberg and Augsburg . The history of Bavaria includes its earliest settlement by Iron Age Celtic tribes , followed by the conquests of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC , when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of Raetia and Noricum . It became a stem duchy in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire . It was later incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire , became an independent kingdom , joined the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom , and finally became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 . The Duchy of Bavaria dates back to the year 555 . In the 17th century AD , the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire . The Kingdom of Bavaria existed from 1806 to 1918 , when Bavaria became a republic . In 1946 , the Free State of Bavaria reorganized itself on democratic lines after the Second World War . Bavaria has a unique culture , largely because of the state 's former Catholic majority and conservative traditions .",

  "/wiki/Bavarian_cuisine": "Bavarian cuisine is a style of cooking from Bavaria , Germany . Bavarian cuisine includes many meat and Kn\u00f6del dishes , and often uses flour . Due to its rural conditions and cold climate , only crops such as beets and potatoes do well in Bavaria , being a staple in the German diet . The Bavarian dukes , especially the Wittelsbach family , developed Bavarian cuisine and refined it to be presentable to the royal court . This cuisine has belonged to wealthy households , especially in cities , since the 19th century . The ( old ) Bavarian cuisine is closely connected to Czech cuisine and Austrian cuisine ( especially from Tyrol and Salzburg ) , mainly through the families Wittelsbach and Habsburg . Already in the beginning , Bavarians were closely connected to their neighbours in Austria through linguistic , cultural and political similarities , which also reflected on the cuisine . A characteristic Bavarian cuisine was further developed by both groups , with a distinct similarity to Franconian and Swabian cuisine . A Bavarian speciality is the Brotzeit , a savoury snack , which would originally be eaten between breakfast and lunch .",

It is usually flavored with parsley , lemon , mace , onions , ginger , and cardamom , although there are some variations . Then the mixture is stuffed into pork casings and separated into individual sausages measuring about ten to twelve centimeters in length and three to four centimeters in thickness . As they are not smoked or otherwise preserved they are very perishable . Wei\u00dfw\u00fcrste traditionally were manufactured early in the morning and prepared and eaten as a snack between breakfast and lunch . There is a saying that the sausages should not be allowed to hear the noon chime of the church bells . Even today , most Bavarians never eat Wei\u00dfw\u00fcrste after lunchtime ( though it is perfectly acceptable to have a lunch consisting of Wei\u00dfw\u00fcrste at , say , half past one ) . The sausages are heated in water - well short of boiling - for about ten minutes , which will turn them greyish-white because no color-preserving nitrite is used in Weisswurst preparation . Wei\u00dfw\u00fcrste are brought to the table in a big bowl together with the hot water used for preparation ( so they do not cool down too much ) , then eaten without their skins . Ways of eating Wei\u00dfwurst include the traditional way , called zuzeln ( Bavarian for sucking ) , in which each end of the sausage is cut or bitten open , after which the meat is sucked out from the skin . Alternatively , the more popular and more discreet ways of consuming it are by cutting the sausage lengthwise and then rolling out the meat from the skin with a fork , or also to open it on one and consume it very much like a banana , ever opening the peel further and dipping the sausage into the mustard . Wei\u00dfwurst is commonly served with a Bavarian sweet mustard ( Wei\u00dfwurstsenf ) and accompanied by Brezn ( Bavarian Pretzel - often spelled Brezeln outside Bavaria ) and Wei\u00dfbier .",
  "/wiki/Sausage": "Sausages are a meat product usually made from ground meat , often pork , beef , or poultry , along with salt , spices and other flavourings . Other ingredients such as grains or breadcrumbs may be included as fillers or extenders . Some sausages include other ingredients for flavour . The word sausage can refer to the loose sausage meat , which can be formed into patties or stuffed into a skin . When referred to as a sausage , the product is usually cylindrical and encased in a skin .

Sausages that are sold raw are cooked in many ways , including pan-frying , broiling and barbecuing . Some sausages are cooked during processing and the casing may then be removed . Sausage making is a traditional food preservation technique . Sausages may be preserved by curing , drying ( often in association with fermentation or culturing , which can contribute to preservation ) , smoking , or freezing . Some cured or smoked sausages can be stored without refrigeration . Most fresh sausages must be refrigerated or frozen until they are cooked .",

It is a regional variation of the wheat beer style from Northern Germany , dating back to at least the 16th century . It can be made from combinations of malted barley and wheat , with the stipulation that the malts are kilned at very low temperatures to minimise colour formation . The fermentation takes place with a mixture of yeast and lactic acid bacteria , a prerequisite that creates the lactic acid taste , a distinguishing feature of Berlin Weisse . By the late 19th century , Berliner Weisse was the most popular alcoholic drink in Berlin , with up to fifty breweries producing it .

Gose beers typically do not have prominent hop bitterness , flavours , or aroma . The beers typically have a moderate alcohol content of 4 to 5% ABV . Because of the use of coriander and salt , gose does not comply with the Reinheitsgebot - it is allowed an exemption on the grounds of being a regional specialty . It acquires its characteristic sourness through inoculation with lactobacillus bacteria .

The cooking process produces sausage juices which , together with any split sausages , are used as a soup known as Metzelsuppe . As a result , in many places , e.g . in parts of the Palatinate , the entire festival and the meal in particular , is known as metzelsupp . Common accompaniments to a Schlachtplatte are sauerkraut and bread or potatoes or , in South Germany , potato pancakes ( Dotsch or Reiberdatschi ) . Other elements might be fresh Bratwurst and Mettwurst or raw , spiced bratwurst filling . In Rhinehessen it is also common to enrich the dish with a sauce from part of the pig 's blood ( Schweinepfeffer or Schwarz Brie ) . The word is derived from schlachten , to slaughter , and Platte , dish , because , traditionally , it is only eaten on the day of slaughter ; before the invention of refrigerators blood and sensitive organs like liver had to be prepared straight away . Meat , which did not have to be consumed immediately was preserved by salting , drying and smoking . The slaughtering day offered a rare opportunity to eat fresh meat which explains why the Schlachtplatte is a rather lavish meal . Originally these slaughtering days took place mainly in the autumn . This meant that not so many animals had to be fed over the winter , the meat could be preserved for longer in the cooler temperatures and the farmers had more time after the last harvest for turning it into ham and sausages which could then be smoked over the winter hearth fire .",

  "/wiki/Egg_yolk": "Among animals which produce eggs , the yolk ( also known as the vitellus ) is the nutrient-bearing portion of the egg whose primary function is to supply food for the development of the embryo . Some types of egg contain no yolk , for example because they are laid in situations where the food supply is sufficient ( such as in the body of the host of a parasitoid ) or because the embryo develops in the parent 's body , which supplies the food , usually through a placenta . Reproductive systems in which the mother 's body supplies the embryo directly are said to be matrotrophic ; those in which the embryo is supplied by yolk are said to be lecithotrophic . In many species , such as all birds , and most reptiles and insects , the yolk takes the form of a special storage organ constructed in the reproductive tract of the mother . In many other animals , especially very small species such as some fishes and invertebrates , the yolk material is not in a special organ , but inside the egg cell ( ovum ) . As stored food , yolks are often rich in vitamins , minerals , lipids and proteins . The proteins function partly as food in their own right , and partly in regulating the storage and supply of the other nutrients . For example , in some species the amount of yolk in an egg cell affects the developmental processes that follow fertilization . The yolk is not living cell material like protoplasm , but largely passive material , that is to say deutoplasm . The food material and associated control structures are supplied during oogenesis . Some of the material is stored more or less in the form in which the maternal body supplied it , partly as processed by dedicated non-germ tissues in the egg , while part of the biosynthetic processing into its final form happens in the oocyte itself . Apart from animals , other organisms , like algae , specially in the oogamous , can also accumulate resources in their female gametes ."
