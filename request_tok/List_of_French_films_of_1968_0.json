Diabolik is pursued by Inspector Ginko ( Michel Piccoli ) , who blackmails the gangster Ralph Valmont ( Adolfo Celi ) into catching Diabolik for him .

His low-budget genre films , known for their distinctive visual flair and stylish technical ingenuity , feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality , and the destructive capacity of human nature .

During the late 1950s , his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers , including I Vampiri ( 1957 ) ( the first Italian horror film of the sound era ) , The Day the Sky Exploded ( 1958 ) ( the first Italian science fiction film ) , Caltiki - The Immortal Monster ( 1959 ) and The Giant of Marathon ( 1959 ) . Although most of Bava 's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release , many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics , with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock . Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres : Black Sunday ( 1960 ) , his official directorial debut , was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle ; The Girl Who Knew Too Much ( 1963 ) is considered to be the first giallo film ; Kill , Baby , Kill ( 1966 ) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror ; Roy Colt & Winchester Jack ( 1970 ) is regarded as one of the earliest self-parodying Spaghetti Westerns ; Four Times That Night ( 1971 ) was an early Italian sex comedy ; and A Bay of Blood ( 1971 ) was a precursor to slasher films . His other notable films include Hercules in the Haunted World ( 1961 ) , Erik the Conqueror ( 1961 ) , Black Sabbath ( 1963 ) , The Whip and the Body ( 1963 ) , Blood and Black Lace ( 1964 ) , Planet of the Vampires ( 1965 ) , Knives of the Avenger ( 1966 ) , Danger : Diabolik ( 1968 ) , Hatchet for the Honeymoon ( 1970 ) , Five Dolls for an August Moon ( 1970 ) , Baron Blood ( 1972 ) , Lisa and the Devil ( 1974 ) , Rabid Dogs ( 1974 ) and Shock ( 1977 ) . Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime , Bava 's shy , self-deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry , and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood . Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento , Lucio Fulci , Federico Fellini , John Carpenter , Nicolas Winding Refn , Martin Scorsese , Tim Burton , Joe Dante , John Landis , Francis Ford Coppola , Roger Corman , Edgar Wright , Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino . His son and frequent assistant director , Lamberto Bava , later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right .",

An Italian-French co-production , the film stars Jean-Louis Trintignant , Klaus Kinski , Vonetta McGee ( in her film d\u00e9but ) and Frank Wolff , with Luigi Pistilli , Mario Brega , Marisa Merlini and Carlo D'Angelo in supporting roles . Conceived by Corbucci as a politically-charged allegory inspired by the deaths of Che Guevara and Malcolm X , the film 's plot takes place in Utah prior to the Great Blizzard of 1899 . It pits a mute gunslinger ( Trintignant ) , fighting in the defence of a group of outlaws and a vengeful young widow ( McGee ) , against a group of ruthless bounty killers led by Loco ( Kinski ) and the corrupt banker Henry Pollicut ( Pistilli ) .

Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox , The Great Silence was theatrically released to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy , but it fared better in other countries . Controversial for its bleak and dark tone , the film 's reputation grew , and it gained a cult following in the wake of its release . The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001 , when it was made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment ; in Britain , it was first shown in 1990 on the BBC2 program Moviedrome .

After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s , he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog ( 1956 ) , an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps . Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour ( 1959 ) , Last Year at Marienbad ( 1961 ) , and Muriel ( 1963 ) , all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past . These films were contemporary with , and associated with , the French New Wave ( la nouvelle vague ) , though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement . He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics . He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol , Marguerite Duras , Alain Robbe-Grillet , Jorge Sempr\u00fan and Jacques Sternberg . In later films , Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms , including theatre , music , and comic books . This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn , Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh , as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song .

  "/wiki/Le_Viol_du_Vampire": "Le Viol du Vampire ( English : The Rape of the Vampire , also known as The Queen of the Vampires ) is a 1968 film directed by Jean Rollin . It was his directorial debut . The film consists of two parts : The Rape of the Vampire and The Vampire Woman/Queen of the Vampires . Originally , the film was only supposed to be a short , but a second part was filmed and added later so that it could be released as a feature film . Critical reaction to the film was very hostile . Its poetic spirit and strong inspiration from American serials did not seem to attract viewers or critics at the time of its release . The film was received negatively and provoked a scandal , , but it remains an important film in the Rollin oeuvre . Themes developed in his subsequent feature films were already present : vampires , a fascination with old cemeteries , lesbianism and a pronounced taste for eroticism . Some scenes and characters were copied almost identically in his later films .",
  "/wiki/Jean_Rollin": "Jean Michel Rollin Roth Le Gentil ( 3 November 1938 - 15 December 2010 ) was a French film director , actor , and novelist best known for his work in the fantastique genre . His career , spanning over fifty years , featured early short films and his achievements with his first four vampire classics Le viol du vampire ( 1968 ) , La vampire nue ( 1970 ) , Le frisson des vampires ( 1970 ) , and Requiem pour un vampire ( 1971 ) . Rollin 's subsequent notable works include La rose de fer ( 1973 ) , L\u00e8vres de sang ( 1975 ) , Les raisins de la mort ( 1978 ) , Fascination ( 1979 ) , and La morte vivante ( 1982 ) . His films are noted for their exquisite , if mostly static , cinematography , off-kilter plot progression and poetic dialogue , their playful surrealism and recurrent use of well-constructed female lead characters . Outlandish denouments and abstruse visual symbols were trademarks throughout his 'dark fantasy ' career . Remarkably , in spite of their seeming high production values and precise craftsmanship , his films were made with very little money , and often under crushing deadlines . In the mid-1970s , lack of regular work led the director to direct mostly pornographic films under various pseudonyms , an activity he continued until the early 1980s .",
  "/wiki/Les_Biches_(1968_film)": "The Does ( French : Les Biches ) is a 1968 French-Italian drama film starring St\u00e9phane Audran , Jean-Louis Trintignant , and Jacqueline Sassard .

While the film does not acknowledge any literary sources , it is loosely based on Patricia Highsmith 's novel , The Talented Mr. Ripley . Chabrol 's screenwriter , Paul G\u00e9gauff , had adapted the Highsmith novel into Purple Noon in 1960 . Les biches switches the gender of the main characters .",
  "/wiki/Claude_Chabrol": "Claude Henri Jean Chabrol ( French : [ klod \u0283ab\u0281\u0254l ] ; 24 June 1930 - 12 September 2010 ) was a French film director and a member of the French New Wave ( nouvelle vague ) group of filmmakers who first came to prominence at the end of the 1950s . Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard , Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , \u00c9ric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette , Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma before beginning his career as a film maker . Chabrol 's career began with Le Beau Serge ( 1958 ) , inspired by Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) . Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol , with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity . This is especially apparent in Les Biches ( 1968 ) , La Femme infid\u00e8le ( 1969 ) , and Le Boucher ( 1970 ) - all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran , who was his wife at the time . Sometimes characterized as a mainstream New Wave director , Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career . In 1978 , he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozi\u00e8re . On the strength of that effort , the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary ( 1991 ) and La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie ( 1996 ) . Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper , if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol 's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium.Some of his films become almost private jokes , made to amuse himself . James Monaco has called Chabrol the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave , and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we do n't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard .",
