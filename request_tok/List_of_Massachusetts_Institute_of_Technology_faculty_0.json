  "/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences": "The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences , commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics , is an award for outstanding contributions to the field of economics , and generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field . The award 's official name is The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ( Swedish : Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne ) . The prize was established in 1968 by a donation from Sweden 's central bank Sveriges Riksbank to the Nobel Foundation to commemorate the bank 's 300th anniversary . As it is not one of the prizes that Alfred Nobel established in his will in 1895 , it is not technically a Nobel Prize . However , it is administered and referred to along with the Nobel Prizes by the Nobel Foundation . Laureates are announced with the Nobel Prize laureates , and receive the award at the same ceremony . Laureates in the Memorial Prize in Economics are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . It was first awarded in 1969 to Dutch and Norwegian economists Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch , for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes .",
  "/wiki/Search_theory": "In microeconomics , search theory studies buyers or sellers who can not instantly find a trading partner , and must therefore search for a partner prior to transacting . Search theory has been influential in many areas of economics . It has been applied in labor economics to analyze frictional unemployment resulting from job hunting by workers . In consumer theory , it has been applied to analyze purchasing decisions . From a worker 's perspective , an acceptable job would be one that pays a high wage , one that offers desirable benefits , and/or one that offers pleasant and safe working conditions . From a consumer 's perspective , a product worth purchasing would have sufficiently high quality , and be offered at a sufficiently low price . In both cases , whether a given job or product is acceptable depends on the searcher 's beliefs about the alternatives available in the market . More precisely , search theory studies an individual 's optimal strategy when choosing from a series of potential opportunities of random quality , under the assumption that delaying choice is costly . Search models illustrate how best to balance the cost of delay against the value of the option to try again . Mathematically , search models are optimal stopping problems . Macroeconomists have extended search theory by studying general equilibrium models in which one or more types of searchers interact . These macroeconomic theories have been called 'matching theory ' , or 'search and matching theory ' .",

  "/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded yearly by the Nobel Foundation for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine . One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal . The most recent Nobel prize was announced by Karolinska Institute on 7 October 2019 , and has been awarded to Americans William Kaelin Jr. , Gregg L. Semenza and British Peter J. Ratcliffe - for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability . Some awards have been controversial . This includes one to Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz in 1949 for the prefrontal lobotomy , bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment .

  "/wiki/Bose\u2013Einstein_condensation": "A Bose-Einstein condensate ( BEC ) is a state of matter ( also called the fifth state of matter ) which is typically formed when a gas of bosons at low densities is cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero ( -273.15 \u00b0C ) . Under such conditions , a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state , at which point microscopic quantum phenomena , particularly wavefunction interference , become apparent macroscopically . A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density , about one-hundred-thousandth ( 1/100,000 ) the density of normal air , to ultra-low temperatures . This state was first predicted , generally , in 1924-1925 by Albert Einstein following a paper written by Satyendra Nath Bose , although Bose came up with the pioneering paper on the new statistics .",

  "/wiki/Phillip_A._Sharp": "Phillip Allen Sharp ( born June 6 , 1944 ) is an American geneticist and molecular biologist who co-discovered RNA splicing . He shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Richard J. Roberts for the discovery that genes in eukaryotes are not contiguous strings but contain introns , and that the splicing of messenger RNA to delete those introns can occur in different ways , yielding different proteins from the same DNA sequence . He has been selected to receive the 2015 Othmer Gold Medal .",
  "/wiki/Split_genes": "An interrupted gene ( also called a split gene ) is a gene that contains sections of DNA called exons , which are expressed as RNA and protein , interrupted by sections of DNA called introns , which are not expressed . The DNA sequence in the exon provides instructions for coding proteins . The function of the intron was not understood at first , and they were called noncoding or junk DNA . Split genes were independently discovered by Richard J. Roberts and Phillip A . Sharp in 1977 , for which they shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Their discovery implied the existence of then-unknown machinery for splicing out introns and assembling genes ; namely , the spliceosome . It was soon accepted that 94% of human genes are interrupted , and 50% of hereditary diseases are involved in splicing intron errors out of interrupted genes . The best known example of a disease caused by a splicing error is Beta-thalassemia , in which extra intronic material is erroneously spliced into the gene for making hemoglobin . Lower eukaryotes , including yeast , have many uninterrupted regions , as they contain long stretches of exons that create the mRNA necessary for the synthesis of proteins . This does not mean , however , that these sections are fully uninterrupted , as tRNA synthesis requires excision of a nucleotide sequence , followed by ligation . Most bacteria have some interruption of some genes . Interrupted genes are universal in eukaryotes ; yeasts may display single interruptions of a minority of genes , while in higher organisms most genes are interrupted .",

  "/wiki/Asymptotic_freedom": "In particle physics , asymptotic freedom is a property of some gauge theories that causes interactions between particles to become asymptotically weaker as the energy scale increases and the corresponding length scale decreases . Asymptotic freedom is a feature of quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) , the quantum field theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons , the fundamental constituents of nuclear matter . Quarks interact weakly at high energies , allowing perturbative calculations . At low energies the interaction becomes strong , leading to the confinement of quarks and gluons within composite hadrons . The asymptotic freedom of QCD was discovered in 1973 by David Gross and Frank Wilczek , and independently by David Politzer in the same year . For this work all three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics .",
