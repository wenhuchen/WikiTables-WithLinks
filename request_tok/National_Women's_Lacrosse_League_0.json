  "/wiki/Aquinas_College_(Michigan)": "The Congregation of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart of the Roman Catholic Order of Preachers ( Dominican Order ) , today commonly known as the Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids , Michigan , led by Mother Aquinata Fiegler , OP , founded the Roman Catholic Novitiate Normal School in Traverse City , Michigan in 1886 . The School 's mission was to educate young women who had yet to make their vows in the Order of Preachers , i. e. , novitiates , to be parochial elementary school teachers throughout Michigan , and it trained and sent forth numerous sister teachers successfully . In 1911 the School was transferred to Grand Rapids , along with the motherhouse of the Sisters , pursuant to an invitation of the Bishop of the young Diocese of Grand Rapids . In response to the need for their sister teachers to hold baccalaureate degrees , in 1922 the Sisters reorganized the Novitiate Normal School as Sacred Heart College and also commenced admitting lay women . The State of Michigan granted a charter to award two-year degrees to women to the new College in the same year . The site of the new College was transferred to the newly erected motherhouse of the Sisters on East Fulton Street , in the margins of Grand Rapids . At some time between 1922 and 1931 it was renamed as Marywood College . In 1931 , it was reorganized as Catholic Junior College , transferred to a site on Ransom Street adjacent to the Grand Rapids Public Library , and became the first Roman Catholic college in the United States governed by women religious to become coeducational . Bishop Joseph G. Pinten of Grand Rapids instigated the reform to admit men alongside women . At that time it awarded two-year degrees . In 1939 Catholic Junior College added a third year to its curriculum . The College began awarding four-year baccalaureate degrees and was renamed Aquinas College in honor of St. Thomas Aquinas , OP and its founder , Mother Aquinata Fiegler , OP , in 1940 , but the articles of incorporation to legally effect the institutional change were not filed with the State of Michigan until 1941 .",

  "/wiki/Christianity": "Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . Its adherents , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity , and chronicled in the New Testament . It is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea . Jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around Syria , the Levant , Europe , Anatolia , Mesopotamia , Transcaucasia , Egypt , and Ethiopia , despite initial persecution . It soon attracted gentile God-fearers , which led to a departure from Jewish customs , and , after the Fall of Jerusalem , AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism , Christianity slowly separated from Judaism . Emperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity before his death ( 337 ) , and was baptized by bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia ; Constantine decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan ( 313 ) , later convening the Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire ( 380 ) . The early history of Christianity 's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the Great Church . The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon ( 451 ) over differences in Christology , while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East-West Schism ( 1054 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome . Similarly , Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era ( 16th century ) over theological and ecclesiological disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome . Following the Age of Discovery ( 15th-17th century ) , Christianity was spread into the Americas , Oceania , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches , as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation , ecclesiology , ordination , and Christology .",

  "/wiki/Baptist": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent ."
