  "/wiki/Anglicanism": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",
  "/wiki/Anglo-Saxons": "The Anglo-Saxons were a cultural group who inhabited Great Britain from the 5th century . They comprise people from Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe , their descendants , and indigenous British groups who adopted many aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture and language ; the cultural foundations laid by the Anglo-Saxons are the foundation of the modern English legal system and of many aspects of English society ; the modern English language owes over half its words - including the most common words of everyday speech - to the language of the Anglo-Saxons . Historically , the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066 , after their initial settlement and up until the Norman conquest . The early Anglo-Saxon period includes the creation of an English nation , with many of the aspects that survive today , including regional government of shires and hundreds . During this period , Christianity was established and there was a flowering of literature and language . Charters and law were also established . The term Anglo-Saxon is popularly used for the language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England and eastern Scotland between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century . In scholarly use , it is more commonly called Old English . The history of the Anglo-Saxons is the history of a cultural identity . It developed from divergent groups in association with the people 's adoption of Christianity , and was integral to the establishment of various kingdoms . Threatened by extended Danish invasions and military occupation of eastern England , this identity was re-established ; it dominated until after the Norman Conquest . The visible Anglo-Saxon culture can be seen in the material culture of buildings , dress styles , illuminated texts and grave goods .",

In Roman Catholic , Eastern Orthodox , Anglican , and Lutheran systems of faith , he is called Saint Michael the Archangel and Saint Michael . In the Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox religions , he is called Saint Michael the Taxiarch . In other Protestant churches , he is simply called Archangel Michael . Michael is mentioned three times in the Book of Daniel . The idea that Michael was the advocate of the Jews became so prevalent that , in spite of the rabbinical prohibition against appealing to angels as intermediaries between God and his people , Michael came to occupy a certain place in the Jewish liturgy . In the New Testament , Michael leads God 's armies against Satan 's forces in the Book of Revelation , where during the war in heaven he defeats Satan . In the Epistle of Jude , Michael is specifically referred to as the archangel Michael . Catholic sanctuaries to Michael appeared in the 4th century , when he was first seen as a healing angel , and then over time as a protector and the leader of the army of God against the forces of evil .",
  "/wiki/Norman_architecture": "The term Norman architecture is used to categorise styles of Romanesque architecture developed by the Normans in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries . In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture . The Normans introduced large numbers of castles and fortifications including Norman keeps , and at the same time monasteries , abbeys , churches and cathedrals , in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded arches ( particularly over windows and doorways ) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style .",

  "/wiki/Sedilia": "In church architecture , sedilia ( plural of Latin sed\u012ble , seat ) are seats , usually made of stone , found on the liturgical south side of an altar , often in the chancel , for use during Mass for the officiating priest and his assistants , the deacon and sub-deacon . The seat is often set back into the main wall of the church itself . Not all sedilia are stone ; there is a timber one thought to be 15th century in St Nicholas ' Church at Rodmersham in Kent . When there is only one such seat , the singular form sedile is used , as for instance at St Mary 's , Princes Risborough , Buckinghamshire or at St Agatha 's , Coates , West Sussex . The first examples in the catacombs were single inlays for the officiating priest . In time the more usual number became three , although there are examples of up to five sedilia . The custom of recessing them in the thickness of the wall began about the end of the 12th century ; some early examples consist only of stone benches , and there is one instance of a single seat or arm-chair in stone at Lenham in Kent . The niches or recesses into which they are sunk are often richly decorated with canopies and subdivided with moulded shafts , pinnacles and tabernacle work ; the seats are sometimes at different levels , the eastern being always the highest , and sometimes an additional niche is provided in which the piscina is placed .",

Anglicans usually refer to the basin , calling it a piscina . Roman Catholics usually refer to the drain , and by extension , the basin , as the sacrarium . They are often made of stone and fitted with a drain , and are in some cases used to dispose of materials used in the sacraments and water from liturgical ablutions . They are found in Roman Catholic , Anglican , and Lutheran churches , and a similar vessel is used in Eastern Orthodox churches .",
  "/wiki/Eastbourne": "Eastbourne ( /\u02c8i\u02d0stb\u0254\u02d0rn/ ( listen ) ) is a town , seaside resort and borough in the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex on the south coast of England , 19 miles ( 31 km ) east of Brighton . Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head , the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain and part of the larger Eastbourne Downland Estate . With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels , a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum , Eastbourne was developed at the direction of the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets . It has a growing population , a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries . Though Eastbourne is a relatively new town , there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age . The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner , William Cavendish , later to become the Duke of Devonshire . Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town , but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration . The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne . As a seaside resort Eastbourne derives a large and increasing income from tourism , with revenue from traditional seaside attractions augmented by conferences , public events and cultural sightseeing . The other main industries in Eastbourne include trade and retail , healthcare , education , construction , manufacturing , professional scientific and the technical sector . Eastbourne 's population is growing ; between 2001 and 2011 it increased from 89,800 to 99,412 . The 2011 census shows that the average age of residents has decreased as the town has attracted students , families and those commuting to London and Brighton .",
  "/wiki/Bell_tower": "A bell tower is a tower that contains one or more bells , or that is designed to hold bells even if it has none . Such a tower commonly serves as part of a church , and will contain church bells , but there are also many secular bell towers , often part of a municipal building , an educational establishment , or a tower built specifically to house a carillon . Church bell towers often incorporate clocks , and secular towers usually do , as a public service . The term campanile ( /\u02cck\u00e6mp\u0259\u02c8ni\u02d0li , -le\u026a/ , also US : /\u02cck\u0251\u02d0m-/ , Italian : [ kampa\u02c8ni\u02d0le ] ) , deriving from the Italian campanile , which in turn derives from campana , meaning bell , is synonymous with bell tower ; though in English usage campanile tends to be used to refer to a free standing bell tower . A bell tower may also in some traditions be called a belfry , though this term may also refer specifically to the substructure that houses the bells and the ringers rather than the complete tower . The tallest free-standing bell tower in the world , 113.2 metres ( 371 ft ) high , is the Mortegliano Bell Tower , in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region , Italy .",

In Byzantine , Romanesque , and Gothic Christian church ( including cathedral and abbey ) architecture , the term is applied to a semi-circular or polygonal termination of the main building at the liturgical east end ( where the altar is ) , regardless of the shape of the roof , which may be flat , sloping , domed , or hemispherical . Smaller apses may also be in other locations , especially shrines .",
  "/wiki/Capital_(architecture)": "In architecture the capital ( from the Latin caput , or head ) or chapiter forms the topmost member of a column ( or a pilaster ) . It mediates between the column and the load thrusting down upon it , broadening the area of the column 's supporting surface . The capital , projecting on each side as it rises to support the abacus , joins the usually square abacus and the usually circular shaft of the column . The capital may be convex , as in the Doric order ; concave , as in the inverted bell of the Corinthian order ; or scrolling out , as in the Ionic order . These form the three principal types on which all capitals in the classical tradition are based . The Composite order established in the 16th century on a hint from the Arch of Titus , adds Ionic volutes to Corinthian acanthus leaves . From the highly visible position it occupies in all colonnaded monumental buildings , the capital is often selected for ornamentation ; and is often the clearest indicator of the architectural order . The treatment of its detail may be an indication of the building 's date .",
  "/wiki/Terracotta": "Terracotta , terra cotta or terra-cotta ( pronounced [ \u02cct\u025brra\u02c8k\u0254tta ] ; Italian : baked earth , from the Latin terra cocta ) , a type of earthenware , is a clay-based unglazed or glazed ceramic , where the fired body is porous . Terracotta is the term normally used for sculpture made in earthenware , and also for various practical uses including vessels ( notably flower pots ) , water and waste water pipes , roofing tiles , bricks , and surface embellishment in building construction . The term is also used to refer to the natural brownish orange color of most terracotta , which varies considerably . [ citation needed ] This article covers the senses of terracotta as a medium in sculpture , as in the Terracotta Army and Greek terracotta figurines , and architectural decoration . Asian and European sculpture in porcelain is not covered . Glazed architectural terracotta and its unglazed version as exterior surfaces for buildings were used in Asia for some centuries before becoming popular in the West in the 19th century . Architectural terracotta can also refer to decorated ceramic elements such as antefixes and revetments , which made a large contribution to the appearance of temples and other buildings in the classical architecture of Europe , as well as in the Ancient Near East . [ citation needed ] In archaeology and art history , terracotta is often used to describe objects such as figurines not made on a potter 's wheel . Vessels and other objects that are or might be made on a wheel from the same material are called earthenware pottery ; the choice of term depends on the type of object rather than the material or firing technique . Unglazed pieces , and those made for building construction and industry , are also more likely to be referred to as terracotta , whereas tableware and other vessels are called earthenware ( though sometimes terracotta if unglazed ) , or by a more precise term such as faience .

  "/wiki/Decimus_Burton": "Decimus Burton FRS FRSA FSA FRIBA ( 30 September 1800 - 14 December 1881 ) was one of the foremost English architects and urban designers of the 19th century . :72 He was the foremost Victorian architect in the Roman revival- , Greek revival- , Georgian neoclassical- , and Regency styles . He was accomplished also in the cottage orn\u00e9- , picturesque- , and neogothic styles . He was a founding Fellow and , later , Vice-President , of the Royal Institute of British Architects , and architect to the Royal Botanic Society from 1840 and an early member of the Athenaeum Club , London , whose club premises he designed and the company of father , James Burton , the pre-eminent property developer of Georgian London , built . Modern architectural historians , such as Guy Williams ( 1990 ) and Dana Arnold ( 2004 ) , contend that Decimus Burton 's contribution to architecture has been grossly underestimated by previous architectural historians : as a consequence of the misattribution to Nash of many of his works ; of his undeserved vituperation by his neo-gothic nemesis , Augustus W. N. Pugin ; and of the consequent retention of his archives by his family . Decimus Burton 's projects include Hyde Park , London ( including the Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner , Wellington Arch , Cumberland Gate , Stanhope Gate , Grosvenor Gate , and the Prince of Wales 's Gate , Knightsbridge ) ; Green Park and St James 's Park ; Regent 's Park , London ( including Cornwall Terrace , York Terrace , Clarence Terrace , Chester Terrace , and the villas of the Inner Circle ( which included his own mansion , The Holme , and the original Winfield House ) ; the enclosure of the forecourt of Buckingham Palace , from which he had Nash 's Marble Arch facing the Palace moved to its present site ; the Clubhouse of the Athenaeum Club , London ; Carlton House Terrace ; Spring Gardens , St. James 's Park ; and the Palm House and the Temperate House at Kew Gardens . Outside London , Burton planned , and designed architecture of , the seaside towns of St Leonards-on-Sea and Fleetwood , and of the spa town Tunbridge Wells . His development of the Calverley Estate , of which only a small proportion survives , that contained elements of the neoclassical- , the Old English- , and the neogothic styles , was highly commended : it has been described as ' a landmark in English domestic architecture ' . For two decades he was engaged on a vast landscaping project to renovate Phoenix Park in Dublin . He was the architect of Dublin Zoo , and of the renewal of the sea-side resort of Queenstown .

  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",

Mosaics have a long history , starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC . Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece ; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times , both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics . Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries ; that tradition was adopted by the Norman Kingdom of Sicily in the 12th century , by the eastern-influenced Republic of Venice , and among the Rus in Ukraine .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
  "/wiki/Rag-stone": "Rag-stone is a name given by some architectural writers to work done with stones that are quarried in thin pieces , such as Horsham Stone , sandstone , Yorkshire stone , and the slate stones , but this is more properly flag or slab work . By rag-stone , or Kentish rag , near London , is meant an excellent material from the neighborhood of Maidstone . It is a very hard limestone of bluish-grey colour , and peculiarly suited for medieval work . It is often laid as uncoursed work , or random work , sometimes as random coursed work and sometimes as regular ashlar . Ragstone , a dull grey stone , is still quarried on an industrial scale close to the Kent Downs AONB . It has traditionally been used within the AONB as a road stone , cobble or sett and a walling block . Although difficult to dress with a regular face it has been used as rectangular blocks for the construction of walls and buildings and was very popular for the construction of 19th-century churches . More frequently , owing to the difficult and variable nature of the stone , it is seen as irregular and self-faced irregular blocks in walling . Due to its irregular shape , as with flint , ragstone has been set within brick quoins and bands . Spalls , fist sized irregular chips of ragstone , have been used to surface paths but modern usage of ragstone is as a general construction aggregate , including fill for gabions and loose or partly binding gravels .",

She was the third child and second daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert . Alice was the first of Queen Victoria 's nine children to die , and one of three to be outlived by their mother , who died in 1901 . Alice spent her early childhood in the company of her parents and siblings , travelling between the British royal residences . Her education was devised by Albert 's close friend and adviser , Baron Stockmar , and included practical activities like needlework and woodwork and languages like French and German . When her father , Prince Albert , became fatally ill in December 1861 , Alice nursed him until his death . Following his death , Queen Victoria entered a period of intense mourning and Alice spent the next six months acting as her mother 's unofficial secretary . On 1 July 1862 , while the court was still at the height of mourning , Alice married the minor German Prince Louis of Hesse , heir to the Grand Duchy of Hesse . The ceremony - conducted privately and with unrelieved gloom at Osborne House - was described by the Queen as more of a funeral than a wedding . The Princess 's life in Darmstadt was unhappy as a result of impoverishment , family tragedy and worsening relations with her husband and mother . Alice was a prolific patron of women 's causes and showed an interest in nursing , especially the work of Florence Nightingale . When Hesse became involved in the Austro-Prussian War , Darmstadt filled with the injured ; the heavily pregnant Alice devoted a lot of her time to the management of field hospitals .",

St E 's , as it is affectionately referred to , is an Anglican church within the Diocese of Chichester . The original derelict church building , which is set for demolition in 2019 and 2020 , once contained chancel paintings by the art historian and conservator , Ernest William Tristram ( 1882-1952 ) . Now housed in the new domed church building next door , the Tristram Panels depict the life of John the Baptist and his parents , the priest Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth . ( Tristram also painted a limited number of original works , including the panels at St Elisabeth 's and paintings at York Minster and St Fin Barre 's Cathedral in Cork City ) . In addition , St Elisabeth 's crypt contained a series of large wall paintings by the artist Hans Feibusch ( 1898-1998 ) . Through this work he came to the attention of Charles Herbert Reilly , professor of architecture , and George Bell who provided Feinbusch with the opportunity to create a mural of his own design at St Elisabeth 's in 1944 . Feibusch chose the allegory of Pilgrim 's Progress as a vehicle for his own story as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany and his eventual acceptance in 1940s Britain . Feibusch enlisted the help of local people to complete the mural , which is now a registered War Memorial dedicated to civilian casualties of war .",
  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",

  "/wiki/Vernacular_architecture": "Vernacular architecture is architecture characterised by the use of local materials and knowledge , usually without the supervision of professional architects . Vernacular architecture represents the majority of buildings and settlements created in pre-industrial societies and includes a very wide range of buildings , building traditions , and methods of construction . Vernacular buildings are typically simple and practical , whether residential houses or built for other purposes . Although it encompasses 95% of the world 's built environment , vernacular architecture tends to be overlooked in traditional histories of design . It is not one specific style , so it can not be distilled into a series of easy-to-digest patterns , materials , or elements . Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders , vernacular buildings are considered part of a regional culture . Vernacular architecture can be contrasted against elite or polite architecture which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building 's functional requirements . This article also covers the term traditional architecture , which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Listed_building": "A listed building , or listed structure , is one that has been placed on one of the four statutory lists maintained by Historic England in England , Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland , Cadw in Wales , and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency in Northern Ireland . The term has also been used in Ireland , where buildings are surveyed for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage in accordance with the country 's obligations under the Granada Convention . However , the preferred term in Ireland is protected structure . A listed building may not be demolished , extended , or altered without special permission from the local planning authority , which typically consults the relevant central government agency , particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings . In England and Wales , a national amenity society must be notified of any work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition . Exemption from secular listed building control is provided for some buildings in current use for worship , but only in cases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent permissions procedure . Owners of listed buildings are , in some circumstances , compelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they fail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations . When alterations are permitted , or when listed buildings are repaired or maintained , the owners are often required to use specific materials or techniques . Although most sites appearing on the lists are buildings , other structures such as bridges , monuments , sculptures , war memorials , and even milestones and mileposts and The Beatles ' Abbey Road pedestrian crossing are also listed . Ancient , military , and uninhabited structures , such as Stonehenge , are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and protected by much older legislation , whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently listed on a non-statutory basis .",
  "/wiki/Lady_chapel": "A Lady chapel or lady chapel is a traditional British term for a chapel dedicated to Our Lady , the Blessed Virgin Mary , particularly those inside a cathedral or other large church . The chapels are also known as a Mary chapel or a Marian chapel , and they were traditionally the largest side chapel of a cathedral , placed eastward from the high altar and forming a projection from the main building as in Winchester Cathedral . Most Roman Catholic and many Anglican cathedrals still have such chapels , while mid-sized churches have smaller side-altars dedicated to the Virgin . The occurrence of lady chapels varies by location and exist in most of the French cathedrals and churches where they form part of the chevet . In Belgium they were not introduced before the 14th century ; in some cases they are of the same size as the other chapels of the chevet , but in others ( probably rebuilt at a later period ) they became much more important features . Some of the best examples can be found in churches of the Renaissance period in Italy and Spain .",
  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",

  "/wiki/Tin_tabernacle": "A tin tabernacle is a type of prefabricated ecclesiastical building made from corrugated galvanised iron . They were developed in the mid-19th century initially in the United Kingdom . Corrugated iron was first used for roofing in London in 1829 by civil engineer Henry Robinson Palmer , and the patent was later sold to Richard Walker who advertised portable buildings for export in 1832 . The technology for producing the corrugated sheets improved , and to prevent corrosion , the sheets were galvanised with a coating of zinc , a process developed by Stanislas Sorel in Paris in the 1830s . After 1850 , many types of prefabricated buildings were produced , including churches , chapels and mission halls .",
  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

  "/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_109": "The Messerschmitt Bf 109 is a German World War II fighter aircraft that was , along with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 , the backbone of the Luftwaffe 's fighter force . The Bf 109 first saw operational service in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War and was still in service at the dawn of the jet age at the end of World War II in 1945 . It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era , including such features as all-metal monocoque construction , a closed canopy , and retractable landing gear . It was powered by a liquid-cooled , inverted-V12 aero engine . From the end of 1941 , the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 . It was commonly called the Me 109 , most often by Allied aircrew and among the German aces , even though this was not the official German designation . It was designed by Willy Messerschmitt and Robert Lusser who worked at Bayerische Flugzeugwerke during the early to mid-1930s . It was conceived as an interceptor , although later models were developed to fulfill multiple tasks , serving as bomber escort , fighter-bomber , day- , night- , all-weather fighter , ground-attack aircraft , and reconnaissance aircraft . It was supplied to several states during World War II , and served with several countries for many years after the war . The Bf 109 is the most produced fighter aircraft in history , with a total of 33,984 airframes produced from 1936 to April 1945 . The Bf 109 was flown by the three top-scoring German fighter aces of World War II , who claimed 928 victories among them while flying with Jagdgeschwader 52 , mainly on the Eastern Front . The highest-scoring fighter ace of all time was Erich Hartmann , who flew the Bf 109 and was credited with 352 aerial victories .",

  "/wiki/Stained_glass": "The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it . Throughout its thousand-year history , the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings . Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows , the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture . Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight . Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages . In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived .",

  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery . Paired windows were sometimes surmounted by a simple opening such as a quatrefoil cut in plate tracery . This form gave way to the more ornate , multi-light traceried windowed .",
  "/wiki/Langney": "Langney is a distinct part of Eastbourne , East Sussex and is on the eastern side of the popular seaside resort . The original village and priory have now been amalgamated with the main town of Eastbourne , and Langney was identified as a single self-contained polling ward within the borough of Eastbourne until 2002 . The etymology of Langney is from the Anglo-Saxon root for Long ( lang ) and Island ( ey ) . Other local place names contain the suffix 'ey ' with this historic meaning because the sea level was rather higher in the pre-Conquest period and areas of higher land stood out as 'islands ' or rather 'eys ' . Pevensey shares the same etymology . Langney proper - the 'Long Island ' - thus refers to the higher part i.e . where the shopping centre now is . Langney contains the Grade II Listed Langney Priory . The oldest part of this building dates to the twelfth century . It was built by Cluniac monks from the very much larger Priory of St Pancras at Lewes . This lesser building at Langney was thus a monastic grange of the senior house . Langney Priory which had been scheduled for demolition in the 1950s is at 2019 undergoing redevelopment and can be visited at community open days .",

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group . The main movements are Baptist churches , Pentecostalism , charismatic Evangelicalism , neo-charismatic Evangelicalism and nondenominational Evangelicalism .",
  "/wiki/Open_Brethren": "The Open Brethren , sometimes called Christian Brethren , are a group of Evangelical Christian churches that arose in the late 1820s as part of the Assembly Movement . They originated in Ireland before spreading throughout the British Isles , and now have an estimated 26,000 assemblies worldwide . The Open Brethren form independent , autonomous assemblies and the name Open is given to them to distinguish them from Exclusive Brethren , with whom they share historical roots . The division of the Plymouth Brethren into the Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren took place in 1848 . Open Brethren are also commonly known as Plymouth Brethren , especially in North America . Many Open Brethren outside of North America , however , are unwilling to use the Plymouth Brethren designation because it is associated with the Exclusive Brethren , particularly the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church , which has often been accused of being a cult and has attracted a considerable degree of unfavourable publicity in the media . The Brethren are committed to missionary work and hold that the Bible is the first authority in matters of faith and practice . Each assembly ( or congregation ) is independent of the others in doctrinal matters , yet there is a high degree of communication and cooperation among those who share similar doctrine and practice . Open Brethren assemblies form a continuum , from tight gatherings that extend fellowship only to those who have first left other denominations , to very loose gatherings that receive into fellowship any stranger without question . A building associated with a group of open brethren is usually called a Gospel Chapel , Gospel Hall , Bible Chapel , Christian Assembly , or other similar term . A sub-set of the Open Brethren are the Gospel Hall Assemblies , who tend to be more conservative than their fellow Brethren in their practices . Theologically , however , they differ very little .",
