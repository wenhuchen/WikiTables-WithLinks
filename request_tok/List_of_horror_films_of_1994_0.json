  "/wiki/The_Kingdom_(TV_miniseries)": "The Kingdom ( Danish title : Riget ) is an eight-episode Danish television mini-series , created by Lars von Trier in 1994 , and co-directed by Lars von Trier and Morten Arnfred . It has been edited together into a five-hour film for distribution in the United Kingdom and United States . [ citation needed ] The series is set in the neurosurgical ward of Copenhagen 's Rigshospitalet , the city and country 's main hospital , nicknamed Riget . Riget means the realm or the kingdom , and leads one to think of d\u00f8dsriget , the realm of the dead . The show follows a number of characters , both staff and patients , as they encounter bizarre phenomena , both human and supernatural . The show is notable for its wry humor , its muted sepia colour scheme , and the appearance of a chorus of dishwashers with Down syndrome who discuss in intimate detail the strange occurrences in the hospital . The first quartet of episodes ended with numerous questions unanswered , and in 1997 , the cast reassembled to produce another group of four episodes , Riget II ( The Kingdom II ) . [ citation needed ] This second series ended with even more questions unanswered than the first , and a third series was planned . However , due to the death in 1998 of Ernst-Hugo J\u00e4reg\u00e5rd ( who played Stig Helmer ) and the subsequent death of Kirsten Rolffes ( who played Mrs Drusse ) in 2000 , the likelihood of a third series is now very remote . [ citation needed ] Von Trier actually wrote the third and final season , but the production was not picked up by DR. At that point , five regular cast members had died and it seemed impossible to continue the series . The abandoned scripts were sent to the producers of Stephen King 's Kingdom Hospital , but it is unclear whether they used the scripts or not . [ citation needed ] Despite being a mini-series , The Kingdom appears as one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die .",
