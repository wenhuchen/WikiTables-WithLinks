  "/wiki/R.S._Blome_Granitoid_Pavement_in_Grand_Forks": "R.S . Blome Granitoid Pavement is a historic road surface , as well as the associated cut sandstone curbs in a few sections , found in three of the oldest residential sections of Grand Forks , North Dakota . It is a Portland cement-aggregate combination that was intended to bridge the gap between the needs of Horse-drawn vehicles , which required sure footing , and automobiles , which needed a hard , resilient surface , in the earliest part of the 20th century . R.S . Blome Granitoid was made from a mixture of Portland cement and angular granite chips along with other stone and sand , laid down over an appropriately arched prepared road bed followed by a six-inch layer of loose gravel ( macadam ) . It was laid in five-foot sections which were sealed at the joints with an asphalt and rubber mix to allow for expansion . Another intended benefit of laying the pavement in these sections was that it allowed for removal of only necessary portions for utility work . However it would appear that this intention was ignored as indicated by the presence of utility cuts and mismatched concrete and asphalt patching in the Grand Forks examples . Over these sections was laid a two-inch finish layer of Portland cement and carefully screened angular granite chips measuring between 1/8 and 3/8 of an inch . Angular chips of granite were specified over rounded river gravel to ensure a firm bond and prohibit the dislodging of gravel common to concrete . As the surface dried it was brushed and scored to resemble cut stone , providing a good non-slip surface for horses . Though the Blome Company patent specified a gridded pattern of scoring , the Grand Forks pavement exhibits a running bond pattern .",
