  "/wiki/Bob_Clampett": "Robert Emerson Clampett ( May 8 , 1913 - May 2 , 1984 ) was an American animator , producer , director , and puppeteer best known for his work on the Looney Tunes animated series from Warner Bros. , and the television shows Time for Beany and Beany and Cecil . Clampett was born and raised not far from Hollywood , and early on expressed an interest in animation and puppetry . After leaving high school a few months shy of graduating in 1931 , Clampett joined the team at Harman-Ising Productions and began working on the studio 's newest short subjects , titled Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies . Clampett was promoted to a directorial position in 1937 and during his fifteen years at the studio , directed 84 cartoons later deemed classic and designed some of the studio 's most famous characters , including Porky Pig , Daffy Duck , and Tweety . Among Clampett 's most acclaimed films are Porky in Wackyland ( 1938 ) and The Great Piggy Bank Robbery ( 1946 ) . Clampett left Warner Bros. Cartoons in 1946 and turned his attention to television , creating the puppet show Time for Beany in 1949 . A later animated version of the series , titled Beany and Cecil , was initially broadcast on ABC in 1962 and was rerun until 1967 . The series is considered the first fully creator-driven television series , and carried the byline a Bob Clampett Cartoon . In his later years , Clampett toured college campuses and animation festivals as a lecturer on the history of animation .

Animation historian Jerry Beck lauded Clampett for putting the word 'looney ' in Looney Tunes .",

  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons .

Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts , Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! This slogan ( without stuttering ) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series ( when Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , in his Brooklynese accent , And Dat 's De End ! ) . He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character . Porky 's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter , for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words ; for example , What 's going on ? might become What 's guh-guh-guh-guh - .what 's happening ? Porky 's age varied widely in the series ; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet ( explicitly mentioned as such in Porky 's Preview ) , Porky was more frequently cast as an adult , often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years . In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons , Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head , and his attempt to close the show with The End becomes Th-Th-The , Th-Th-The , Th-Th .",

Coyote ( also known simply as the Coyote ) and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . In each episode , the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner , a fast-running ground bird , but is never successful . Instead of his animal instincts , the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions ( sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg ) to try to catch his prey , which backfire comically , with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion . Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme . One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff . After he goes over the edge , the rest of the scene , shot from a bird's-eye view , shows him falling into a canyon so deep , that his figure is eventually lost to sight . This is followed , a second or two later , by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits . Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name . The Road Runner is called by such names as Accelerati incredibilus , Velocitus tremenjus , Birdibus zippibus , Speedipus rex and Morselus babyfatious tastius . Species names for Wile E. Coyote include Carnivorous slobbius , Eatius birdius , Overconfidentii vulgaris , Poor schinookiusor Caninus nervousrex .
