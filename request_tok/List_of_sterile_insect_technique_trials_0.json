Tsetse flies include all the species in the genus Glossina , which are placed in their own family , Glossinidae . The tsetse are obligate parasites that live by feeding on the blood of vertebrate animals . Tsetse have been extensively studied because of their role in transmitting disease . They have a prominent economic impact in sub-Saharan Africa as the biological vectors of trypanosomes , which cause human sleeping sickness and animal trypanosomiasis . Tsetse are multivoltine and long-lived , typically producing about four broods per year , and up to 31 broods over their lifespans . Tsetse can be distinguished from other large flies by two easily observed features . Tsetse fold their wings completely when they are resting so that one wing rests directly on top of the other over their abdomens . Tsetse also have a long proboscis , which extends directly forward and is attached by a distinct bulb to the bottom of their heads . Fossilized tsetse have been recovered from Florissant Fossil Beds in Colorado , laid down some 34 million years ago . Twenty-three extant species of tsetse flies are known from Africa . Tsetse were absent from much of southern and eastern Africa until colonial times .",

It borders Uganda to the north ; Kenya to the northeast ; Comoro Islands and the Indian Ocean to the east ; Mozambique and Malawi to the south ; Zambia to the southwest ; and Rwanda , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west . Mount Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , is in northeastern Tanzania . Many important hominid fossils have been found in Tanzania , such as 6-million-year-old Pliocene hominid fossils . The genus Australopithecus ranged all over Africa 4 to 2 million years ago ; and the oldest remains of the genus Homo are found near Lake Olduvai . Following the rise of Homo erectus 1.8 million years ago , humanity spread all over the Old World , and later in the New World and Australia under the species Homo sapiens . Homo sapiens also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity . One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing , the Hadzabe , appears to have originated in Tanzania , and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire , medicine , and lived in caves , much like Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis who lived in the same region before them . Later in the Stone and Bronze Age , prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included Southern Cushitic speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia ; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago ; and the Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , who originated from the present-day South Sudan-Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . : page 18 These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas . They subsequently migrated across the rest of Tanzania between 2,300 and 1,700 years ago . German rule began in mainland Tanzania during the late 19th century when Germany formed German East Africa .",

There are five species of Cochliomyia but only one species of screw-worm fly in the genus ; there is also a single Old World species in a different genus ( Chrysomya bezziana ) .

A. ludens is native to Mexico and Central America and is a major pest to citrus and mango agriculture in Mexico , Central America , and the lower Rio Grande Valley . The species exhibits high fecundity and relatively long lifespans compared to other species of fruit flies . These qualities make the Mexican fruit fly a particularly aggressive invasive species , especially threatening agriculture because the larvae grow and feed on many different species of fruit . The Anastrepha genus is designated as one of three genera that pose the greatest risk to American agriculture . According to the USDA , A. ludens is the only important member of the Anastrepha genus that is subtropical instead of tropical and thus has a range much further North than most Anastrepha species .

  "/wiki/Cytoplasmic_incompatibility": "Cytoplasmic incompatibility ( CI ) is a phenomenon that results in sperm and eggs being unable to form viable offspring . The effect arises from changes in the gamete cells caused by intracellular parasites like Wolbachia , which infect a wide range of insect species . As the reproductive incompatibility is caused by bacteria that reside in the cytoplasm of the host cells , it is referred to as cytoplasmic incompatibility . In 1971 , Janice Yen and A. Ralph Barr of UCLA demonstrated the etiologic relationship of Wolbachia infection and cytoplasmic incompatibility in Culex mosquitos when they found that eggs were killed when the sperm of Wolbachia-infected males fertilized infection-free eggs ."
