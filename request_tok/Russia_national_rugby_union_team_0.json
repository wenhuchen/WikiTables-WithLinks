Initially on the receiving end of some heavy defeats , the side has grown in competitiveness , recording a fourth-place finish in 2007 and 2013 , and one-sided defeats have become less frequent . The Azzurri have shown respectable results when playing at home in recent years : they defeated France 22-21 in the 2011 Six Nations ; and during the 2013 Six Nations , they again beat France 23-18 , also defeating Ireland 22-15 . However , Italy has not won a Six Nations match since their 22-19 away win against Scotland in Round 3 of the 2015 tournament , losing every game since ; this equates to a losing run of 22 matches . The Italian team has also competed at every Rugby World Cup since the first tournament in 1987 , where Italy played the inaugural game against New Zealand , but is yet to progress beyond the first round .",
