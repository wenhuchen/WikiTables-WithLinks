  "/wiki/Municipalities_of_Norway": "Norway is divided into 11 administrative regions , called counties ( fylker in Norwegian , singular : fylke ) , and 356 municipalities ( kommuner/-ar , singular : kommune - cf . communes ) . The capital city Oslo is considered both a county and a municipality . Municipalities are the atomic unit of local government in Norway and are responsible for primary education ( until 10th grade ) , outpatient health services , senior citizen services , unemployment and other social services , zoning , economic development , and municipal roads . Law enforcement and church services are provided at a national level in Norway . Municipalities are undergoing continuous consolidation . In 1930 , there were 747 municipalities in Norway . As of 2020 there are 356 municipalities , a reduction from 422 . See the list of former municipalities of Norway for further detail about municipal mergers . The consolidation effort is complicated by a number of factors . Since block grants are made by the national government to the municipalities based on an assessment of need , there is little incentive for the municipalities to lose local autonomy . The national policy is that municipalities should only merge voluntarily , and studies are underway to identify potential gains .",

  "/wiki/Mountain": "A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area , usually in the form of a peak . A mountain is generally steeper than a hill . Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism . These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth . Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers , weather conditions , and glaciers . A few mountains are isolated summits , but most occur in huge mountain ranges . High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level . These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains : different elevations have different plants and animals . Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate , mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation , such as mountain climbing and skiing . The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia , whose summit is 8,850 m ( 29,035 ft ) above mean sea level . The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m ( 69,459 ft ) .",

A glacier forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation ( melting and sublimation ) over many years , often centuries . Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight , creating crevasses , seracs , and other distinguishing features . They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines . Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water . On Earth , 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets ( also known as continental glaciers ) in the polar regions , but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges on every continent including Oceania 's high-latitude oceanic island countries such as New Zealand . Between 35\u00b0N and 35\u00b0S , glaciers occur only in the Himalayas , Andes , Rocky Mountains , a few high mountains in East Africa , Mexico , New Guinea and on Zard Kuh in Iran .

It is named for Akershus Fortress in Oslo . From the middle ages to 1919 Akershus was a fief and main county that included most of Eastern Norway ; from the 17th century to 2020 Akershus also had a more narrow meaning as a ( sub ) county that included most of the Greater Oslo Region . Originally Akershus was one of four main fiefs in Norway and included almost all of Eastern Norway . The original Akershus became a main county ( Stiftamt or Stift ) in 1662 and was sometimes also known as Christiania Stift . It included several sub counties ( Amt or Underamt ) ; in 1682 its most central areas , consisting of modern Oslo and Akershus , became the sub county of Akershus within the larger main county of the same name . In 1842 the capital city of Christiania , which at the time consisted of a tiny part of modern Oslo , became a separate sub county within Akershus main county . The main county of Akershus was disestablished in 1919 , and the sub county continued as Akershus county ( fylke ) . During its history Akershus ( sub ) county ceded territory to Oslo several times ; Akershus ' most central and important municipality , Aker , was transferred to Oslo in 1948 . The remaining county of Akershus after 1948 borders Hedmark , Oppland , Buskerud , Oslo , and \u00d8stfold ; it also has a short border with Sweden ( V\u00e4rmland ) . Akershus , with a little over 614,000 inhabitants , is the second most populated county by population after Oslo . The county administration is in central Oslo , which is not part of the modern county per se .",

It constitutes both a county and a municipality . During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken , the northernmost Danish province . Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the name \u00c1nslo , and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada . The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300 . Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence . After being destroyed by a fire in 1624 , during the reign of King Christian IV , a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king 's honour . It was established as a municipality ( formannskapsdistrikt ) on 1 January 1838 . The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814-1905 union between Sweden and Norway . From 1877 , the city 's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage , a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897 . In 1925 the city , after incorporating the village retaining its former name , was renamed Oslo . In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker , a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger , thus creating the modern , vastly enlarged Oslo municipality .",
