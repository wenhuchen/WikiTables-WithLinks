  "/wiki/Annunciation_(Leonardo)": "Annunciation is a painting attributed to the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci , dating from circa 1472-1475 . It is housed in the Uffizi gallery of Florence , Italy . Leonardo da Vinci might have finished the Annunciation in his early twenties . The subject matter is drawn from Luke 1.26-39 and depicts the angel Gabriel , sent by God to announce to a virgin , Mary , that she would miraculously conceive and give birth to a son , to be named Jesus , and to be called the Son of God whose reign would never end . The subject was very popular for artworks and had been depicted many times in the art of Florence , including several examples by the Early Renaissance painter Fra Angelico . The details of its commission and its early history remain obscure . In 1867 , following Gustav Waagen methods , Baron Liphart identified this Annunciation , newly arrived in the Uffizi Gallery from the convent of Monte Oliveto Maggiore , as by the young Leonardo , still working in the studio of his master Verrocchio . Before Liphart the painting had been attributed to Domenico Ghirlandaio . [ citation needed ]",

One of the most important Italian museums and the most visited , it is also one of the largest and best known in the world and holds a collection of priceless works , particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance . After the ruling house of Medici died out , their art collections were gifted to the city of Florence under the famous Patto di famiglia negotiated by Anna Maria Luisa , the last Medici heiress . The Uffizi is one of the first modern museums . The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century , and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public , formally becoming a museum in 1865 . Today , the Uffizi is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Florence and one of the most visited art museums in the world .",

After running two important art galleries in the 1930s and 1940s , he came to wider public notice on television , presenting a succession of programmes on the arts during the 1950s and 1960s , culminating in the Civilisation series in 1969 . The son of rich parents , Clark was introduced to the arts at an early age . Among his early influences were the writings of John Ruskin , which instilled in him the belief that everyone should have access to great art . After coming under the influence of the connoisseur and dealer Bernard Berenson , Clark was appointed director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford aged twenty-seven , and three years later he was put in charge of Britain 's National Gallery . His twelve years there saw the gallery transformed to make it accessible and inviting to a wider public . During the Second World War , when the collection was moved from London for safe keeping , Clark made the building available for a series of daily concerts which proved a celebrated morale booster during the Blitz . After the war , and three years as Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford , Clark surprised many by accepting the chairmanship of the UK 's first commercial television network . Once the service had been successfully launched he agreed to write and present programmes about the arts . These established him as a household name in Britain , and he was asked to create the first colour series about the arts , Civilisation , first broadcast in 1969 in Britain and in many other countries soon afterwards . Among many honours , Clark was knighted at the unusually young age of thirty-five , and three decades later was made a life peer shortly before the first transmission of Civilisation . Three decades after his death , Clark was celebrated in an exhibition at Tate Britain in London , prompting a reappraisal of his career by a new generation of critics and historians .",

The picture depicts the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as recorded in the Biblical Gospels of Matthew , Mark and Luke . The angel to the left is recorded as having been painted by the youthful Leonardo , a fact which has excited so much special comment and mythology , that the importance and value of the picture as a whole and within the \u0153uvre of Verrocchio is often overlooked .

There are two of Leonardo 's preliminary sketches for this piece in the British Museum , although the painting was probably overpainted by other hands . The preliminary sketches and the painting itself suggest that Leonardo was concentrating on the idea of sight . [ a ] The child is thought to be guiding his mother 's hands into his central vision .

Its collection belongs to the government on behalf of the British public , and entry to the main collection is free of charge . It is among the most visited art museums in the world , after the Louvre , the British Museum , and the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Unlike comparable museums in continental Europe , the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection . It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein in 1824 . After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors , notably Sir Charles Lock Eastlake , and by private donations , which today account for two-thirds of the collection . The collection is small compared with many European national galleries , but encyclopaedic in scope ; most major developments in Western painting from Giotto to C\u00e9zanne are represented with important works .

She served as the regent of Mantua during the absence of her husband , Francesco II Gonzaga , Marquess of Mantua , and the minority of her son , Federico , Duke of Mantua . In 1500 she met King Louis XII of France in Milan on a diplomatic mission to persuade him not to send his troops against Mantua . She was a prolific letter-writer and maintained a lifelong correspondence with her sister-in-law Elisabetta Gonzaga . Lucrezia Borgia was another sister-in-law ; she later became the mistress of Isabella 's husband . She was described as having been physically attractive , albeit slightly plump ; however , she also possessed lively eyes and was of lively grace . Isabella d'Este grew up in a cultured family in the city-state of Ferrara . She received a fine classical education and as a girl met many famous humanist scholars and artists . Due to the vast amount of extant correspondence between Isabella and her family and friends , her life is unusually well documented .",
  "/wiki/Madonna_of_the_Yarnwinder": "The Madonna of the Yarnwinder ( Italian : Madonna dei Fusi , Madonna of the Spindles ) is a subject depicted by Leonardo da Vinci in at least one , and perhaps two paintings begun in 1499 or later . Leonardo was recorded as being at work on one such picture in Florence in 1501 for Florimond Robertet , a secretary to King Louis XII of France . This may have been delivered to the French court in 1507 , though scholars are divided on this point . The subject is known today from several versions of which two , called the Buccleuch Madonna and the Lansdowne Madonna , are thought to be partly by Leonardo 's hand . The underdrawings of both paintings show similar experimental changes made to the composition ( or pentimenti ) , suggesting that both evolved concurrently in Leonardo 's workshop . The composition shows the Virgin Mary seated in a landscape with the Christ child , who gazes at a yarnwinder used to collect spun yarn . The yarnwinder serves both as a symbol of Mary 's domesticity and as a foreshadowing of the Cross on which Christ was crucified . The painting 's dynamic composition and implied narrative was highly influential on later High Renaissance depictions of the Madonna and Child by artists such as Raphael and Andrea del Sarto .",
  "/wiki/Scottish_National_Gallery": "The Scottish National Gallery ( formerly the National Gallery of Scotland ) is the national art gallery of Scotland . It is located on The Mound in central Edinburgh , close to Princes Street . The building was designed in a neoclassical style by William Henry Playfair , and first opened to the public in 1859 . The gallery houses Scotland 's national collection of fine art , spanning Scottish and international art from the beginning of the Renaissance up to the start of the 20th century . The Scottish National Gallery is run by National Galleries of Scotland , a public body that also owns the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery . Because of its architectural similarity , the Scottish National Gallery is frequently confused by visitors with the neighbouring Royal Scottish Academy Building ( RSA ) , a separate institution which works closely with the Scottish National Gallery .",

  "/wiki/Terminus_post_quem": "Terminus post quem ( limit after which , often abbreviated to TPQ ) and terminus ante quem ( limit before which , abbreviated to TAQ ) specify the known limits of dating for events . A terminus post quem is the earliest time the event may have happened , and a terminus ante quem is the latest . An event may well have both a terminus post quem and a terminus ante quem , in which case the limits of the possible range of dates are known at both ends , but many events have just one or the other . Similarly , terminus ad quem ( limit to which ) is the latest possible date of a non-punctual event ( period , era , etc . ) , while terminus a quo ( limit from which ) is the earliest . The concepts are similar to those of upper and lower bounds in mathematics .",
