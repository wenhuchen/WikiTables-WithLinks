  "/wiki/Ralph_Wolf_and_Sam_Sheepdog": "Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog are characters in a series of animated cartoons in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . The characters were created by Chuck Jones . Ralph Wolf has virtually the same character design as another Chuck Jones character , Wile E. Coyote - brown fur , wiry body , and huge ears , but with a red nose in place of the Coyote 's black one ; ( usually ) white eyes instead of the Coyote 's yellow ones ; and , occasionally , a fang protruding from his mouth . He also shares the Coyote 's appetite and persistent use of Acme Corporation products , but he covets sheep instead of roadrunners and , when he speaks , does not have the upper-class accent or the egotistical bearing of the Coyote . Another crucial difference is that of personality : Ralph does not have the fanatical drive of the Coyote in pursuing his prey , preferring to abandon his chase at the end of the working day . Sam Sheepdog , by contrast , is a large , burly Berger de Brie ( Briard ) with white or tan fur and a mop of red hair that usually covers his eyes . He very rarely runs and tends to be sedentary in his movements . He does , however , possess sufficient strength to incapacitate Ralph with a single punch once he catches him .",

  "/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner": "Wile E. Coyote ( also known simply as the Coyote ) and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . In each episode , the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner , a fast-running ground bird , but is never successful . Instead of his animal instincts , the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions ( sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg ) to try to catch his prey , which backfire comically , with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion . Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme . One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff . After he goes over the edge , the rest of the scene , shot from a bird's-eye view , shows him falling into a canyon so deep , that his figure is eventually lost to sight . This is followed , a second or two later , by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits . Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name . The Road Runner is called by such names as Accelerati incredibilus , Velocitus tremenjus , Birdibus zippibus , Speedipus rex and Morselus babyfatious tastius . Species names for Wile E. Coyote include Carnivorous slobbius , Eatius birdius , Overconfidentii vulgaris , Poor schinookiusor Caninus nervousrex . The characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese in 1948 for Warner Bros. , while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese . The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts ( the first 16 of which were written by Maltese ) and occasional made-for-television cartoons ."
