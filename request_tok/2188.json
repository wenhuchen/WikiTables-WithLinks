From 1989 she was the general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( AIADMK ) , a Dravidian party whose cadre revered her as their Amma ( mother ) and Puratchi Thalaivi ( revolutionary leader ) . Her critics in the media and the opposition accused her of fostering a personality cult and of demanding absolute loyalty from AIADMK legislators and ministers , who often publicly prostrated themselves before her . Jayalalithaa first came into prominence as a leading film actress in the mid-1960s . Though she had entered the profession reluctantly , upon the urging of her mother to support the family , Jayalalithaa worked prolifically . She appeared in 140 films between 1961 and 1980 , primarily in the Tamil , Telugu and Kannada languages . Jayalalithaa received praise for her versatility as an actress and for her dancing skills , earning the sobriquet Queen of Tamil Cinema . Among her frequent co-stars was M. G. Ramachandran , a Tamil cultural icon who leveraged his immense popularity with the masses into a successful political career . In 1982 , when MGR was chief minister , Jayalalithaa joined the AIADMK , the party he founded . Her political rise was rapid ; within a few years she became AIADMK propaganda secretary and was elected to the Rajya Sabha , the upper house of India 's Parliament . After MGR 's death in 1987 , Jayalalithaa proclaimed herself his political heir and , having fought off the faction headed by Janaki Ramachandran , MGR 's widow , emerged as the sole leader of the AIADMK . Following the 1989 election , she became Leader of the Opposition to the DMK-led government headed by Karunanidhi , her b\u00eate noire .",
