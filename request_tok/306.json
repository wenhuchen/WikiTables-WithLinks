  "/wiki/Irish_language": "Irish ( Gaeilge ) is a Goidelic language of the Celtic languages family , itself a branch of the Indo-European language family . Irish originated in Ireland and was historically spoken by Irish people throughout Ireland . Irish is spoken as a first language in substantial areas of counties Galway , Kerry , Cork and Donegal , smaller areas of Waterford , Mayo and Meath , and a few other locations . It is also spoken by a much larger group of habitual but non-traditional speakers across the country , mostly in urban areas and mostly as a second language . Irish has been the dominant language of the Irish people for most of their recorded history , and they took it with them to other regions , notably Scotland and the Isle of Man , where Middle Irish gave rise to Scottish Gaelic and Manx respectively . It has the oldest vernacular literature in Western Europe . Irish has constitutional status as the national and first official language of the Republic of Ireland and is an officially recognised minority language in Northern Ireland .
