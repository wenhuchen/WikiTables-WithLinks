It consists of a commercial industry involved in the research and development , engineering , production , and servicing of military material , equipment , and facilities . Arms-producing companies , also referred to as arms dealers , defense contractors , or as the military industry , produce arms for the armed forces of states and for civilians . Departments of government also operate in the arms industry , buying and selling weapons , munitions and other military items . An arsenal is a place where arms and ammunition - whether privately or publicly owned - are made , maintained and repaired , stored , or issued , in any combination . Products of the arms industry include guns , artillery , ammunition , missiles , military aircraft , military vehicles , ships , electronic systems , night-vision devices , holographic weapon sights , laser rangefinders , laser sights , hand grenades , landmines and more . The arms industry also provides other logistical and operational support . The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) estimated military expenditures as of 2018 [ update ] at $ 1822 billion . This represented a relative decline from 1990 , when military expenditures made up 4% of world GDP . Part of the money goes to the procurement of military hardware and services from the military industry . The combined arms-sales of the top 100 largest arms-producing companies and military services companies ( excluding China ) totalled $ 420 billion in 2018 , according to SIPRI . This was 4.6 per cent higher than sales in 2017 and marks the fourth consecutive year of growth in Top 100 arms sales .",

  "/wiki/Chemicals": "A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition and characteristic properties . Some references add that chemical substance can not be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation methods , i.e. , without breaking chemical bonds .

Chemical substances are often called 'pure ' to set them apart from mixtures . A common example of a chemical substance is pure water ; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory . Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond ( carbon ) , gold , table salt ( sodium chloride ) and refined sugar ( sucrose ) . However , in practice , no substance is entirely pure , and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical . Chemical substances exist as solids , liquids , gases , or plasma , and may change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure . Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of chemical reactions . Forms of energy , such as light and heat , are not matter , and are thus not substances in this regard .",

  "/wiki/Energy": "In physics , energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on , or to heat , the object . [ note 1 ] Energy is a conserved quantity ; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form , but not created or destroyed . The SI unit of energy is the joule , which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton . Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object , the potential energy stored by an object 's position in a force field ( gravitational , electric or magnetic ) , the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects , the chemical energy released when a fuel burns , the radiant energy carried by light , and the thermal energy due to an object 's temperature . Mass and energy are closely related . Due to mass-energy equivalence , any object that has mass when stationary ( called rest mass ) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy , and any additional energy ( of any form ) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object 's total mass just as it increases its total energy . For example , after heating an object , its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass , with a sensitive enough scale . Living organisms require energy to stay alive , such as the energy humans get from food . Human civilization requires energy to function , which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels , nuclear fuel , or renewable energy . The processes of Earth 's climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth .",

It is transmitted through a transmission medium , such as over physical media , for example , over electrical cable , or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as radio or light . Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites . A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 , and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications . These included Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse ( inventors of the telegraph ) , Alexander Graham Bell ( inventor of the telephone ) , Edwin Armstrong and Lee de Forest ( inventors of radio ) , as well as Vladimir K. Zworykin , John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth ( some of the inventors of television ) .",
