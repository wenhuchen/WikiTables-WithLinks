It began on August 17 , 1862 , along the Minnesota River in southwest Minnesota , four years after its admission as a state . Throughout the late 1850s in the lead-up to the war , treaty violations by the United States and late or unfair annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota . During the war , the Dakota made extensive attacks on hundreds of settlers and immigrants , which resulted in settler deaths , and caused many to flee the area . Intense desire for immediate revenge ended with soldiers capturing hundreds of Dakota men and interning their families . A military tribunal quickly tried the men , sentencing 303 to death for their crimes . President Lincoln would later commute the sentence of 264 of them . The mass hanging of 38 Dakota men was conducted on December 26 , 1862 , in Mankato , Minnesota ; it was the largest mass execution in United States history . Traders with the Dakota previously had demanded that the government give the annuity payments directly to them ( introducing the possibility of unfair dealing between the agents and the traders to the exclusion of the Dakota ) . In mid-1862 , the Dakota demanded the annuities directly from their agent , Thomas J. Galbraith . The traders refused to provide any more supplies on credit under those conditions , and negotiations reached an impasse . On August 17 , 1862 , one young Dakota with a hunting party of three others killed five settlers while on a hunting expedition .",
  "/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",

  "/wiki/Log_boom": "A log boom is a barrier placed in a river , designed to collect and or contain floating logs timbered from nearby forests sometimes called a fence or bag . The term is also used as a place where logs were collected into booms , as at the mouth of a river . With several firms driving on the same stream , it was necessary to direct the logs to their owner 's respective booms , with each log identified by its own patented timber mark . One of the most well known logbooms was in Williamsport , Pennsylvania , along the Susquehanna River . The development and completion of that specific log boom in 1851 made Williamsport the Lumber Capital of the World . As the logs proceeded downstream , they encountered these booms in a manner that allowed log drivers to control their progress , eventually guiding them to the river mouth or sawmills . Most importantly , the booms could be towed across lakes , like rafts , or anchored while individual logs awaited their turn to go through the mill . Booms prevented the escape into open waters of these valuable assets . Log boom foundations were commonly constructed of piles or large stones placed into cribs in a river to form small islands . The booms were themselves large floating logs linked together end to end , like a large floating chain connecting the foundations while strategically guiding the transported logs along their path . Large blocks of ice commonly threaten booms , pushing free-flowing logs over the structures . Significantly large chunks of ice can even gain enough power so as to break through the boom altogether , freeing the logs and endangering unsuspecting people and wildlife located downstream .",

He is best known for his midnight ride to alert the colonial militia in April 1775 to the approach of British forces before the battles of Lexington and Concord , as dramatized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's poem , Paul Revere 's Ride ( 1861 ) . At age 41 , Revere was a prosperous , established and prominent Boston silversmith . He had helped organize an intelligence and alarm system to keep watch on the British military . Revere later served as a Massachusetts militia officer , though his service ended after the Penobscot Expedition , one of the most disastrous campaigns of the American Revolutionary War , for which he was absolved of blame . Following the war , Revere returned to his silversmith trade . He used the profits from his expanding business to finance his work in iron casting , bronze bell and cannon casting , and the forging of copper bolts and spikes . In 1800 , he became the first American to successfully roll copper into sheets for use as sheathing on naval vessels .",
  "/wiki/Sioux": "The Sioux ( /su\u02d0/ ; Dakota : O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b /ot\u0283\u02b0e\u02d0t\u02b0i \u0283ako\u02d0w\u0129/ ) are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America . The term is an exonym created from a French transcription of the Anishinaabe term Nadouessioux , and can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation 's many language dialects . The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on language divisions : the Dakota and Lakota . Before the 17th century , the Santee Dakota ( Is\u00e1\u014byathi ; Knife also known as the Eastern Dakota ) lived around Lake Superior with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin . They gathered wild rice , hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish . Wars with the Ojibwe throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota , where the Western Dakota ( Yankton , Yanktonai ) and Teton ( Lakota ) were residing . In the 1800s , the Dakota signed treaties with the United States , ceding much of their land in Minnesota . Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time , as well as low food supplies , led to the Dakota War of 1862 , which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska , North and South Dakota and Canada . After 1870 , the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota , creating the present-day reservations in the state . The Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota ( Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b and Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014bna ; Village-at-the-end and Little village-at-the-end ) , collectively also referred to by the endonym Wi\u010dh\u00edyena , resided in the Minnesota River area before ceding their land and moving to South Dakota in 1858 . Despite ceding their lands , their treaty with the U.S. government allowed them to maintain their traditional role in the O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b as the caretakers of the Pipestone Quarry , which is the cultural center of the Sioux people . They are considered to be the Western Dakota ( also called middle Sioux ) , and have in the past been erroneously classified as Nakota ."
