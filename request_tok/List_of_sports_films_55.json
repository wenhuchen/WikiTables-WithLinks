A larger , longer board allows a rider to paddle fast enough to catch the wave and has the advantage of being more stable , but it also limits maneuverability and surfing speed . In 1992 , big wave surfers such as Laird Hamilton and Darrick Doerner introduced a cross over sport called tow-in surfing . While many riders still participate in both sports , they remain very distinct activities . This type of surfing involves being towed into massive waves by jet ski , allowing for the speed needed to successfully ride . Tow in surfing also revolutionized board size , allowing surfers to trade in their unwieldy 12 ft. boards in favor of light , 7 ft boards that allowed for more speed and easier maneuverability in waves over 30 ft.
