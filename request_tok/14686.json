  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha ( sometimes called cha-cha ) , is a dance of Cuban origin . It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s . This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo . The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers ' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps ( correctly , on the fourth count of each measure ) that characterize the dance . In the early 1950s , Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica . The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n , danzonete , and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds . Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo . To make his music more appealing to dancers , Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated . When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana , it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound cha-cha-cha . Thus , the new style came to be known as cha-cha-ch\u00e1 and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step . The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 ( one , two , three , cha-cha ) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion . For example , one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern .",

  "/wiki/Disco": "Disco is a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the 1970s from the United States ' urban nightlife scene . The disco sound is typified by four-on-the-floor beats , syncopated basslines , and string sections , horns , electric piano , synthesizers , and electric rhythm guitars . Lead guitar features less frequently in disco than in rock . Well-known disco artists include Donna Summer , Gloria Gaynor , the Bee Gees , Chic , KC and the Sunshine Band , Thelma Houston , Sister Sledge , the Trammps , Village People and Michael Jackson . While performers and singers garnered public attention , record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre . Films such as Saturday Night Fever ( 1977 ) and Thank God It 's Friday ( 1978 ) contributed to disco 's mainstream popularity . Disco started as a mixture of music from venues popular with African Americans and also Hispanic and Latino Americans , and LGBT peoplein Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s . Disco can be seen as a reaction by the counterculture during this period to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time . Several dance styles were developed during the period of disco 's popularity in the United States , including the Bump and the Hustle . By the late 70s , most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes , and DJs would mix dance records at clubs such as Studio 54 in New York City , a venue popular among celebrities . Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore expensive , extravagant and sexy fashions . There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene , particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights , such as cocaine and Quaaludes , the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed disco biscuits .",

  "/wiki/Salsa_(dance)": "Salsa is a Latin dance associated with the music genre of the same name which originated in the 1960s in New York City . Salsa is an amalgamation of Cuban dances that were popular in the ballrooms and nightclubs of Havana by the end of the 1950s ( e.g . casino , mambo and pachanga ) , as well as American jazz dances . It was primarily developed by Puerto Ricans living in New York ( Nuyoricans ) in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as Cuban , Puerto Rican , Cali Colombia , L.A. and New York styles . Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs , bars , ballrooms , restaurants , and outside , especially when part of an outdoor festival . In many styles of salsa dancing , as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping , the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes . Weight shifts cause the hips to move . Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated . Salsa generally uses music ranging from about 150 bpm ( beats per minute ) to around 250 bpm , although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160-220 bpm . The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music . The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps .",

The most popular commercial genre in Bollywood since the 1970s has been the masala film , which freely mixes different genres including action , comedy , romance , drama and melodrama along with musical numbers . Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre , of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer since the 1960s when it exceeded the American film industry 's total musical output after musical films declined in the West ; the first Indian musical talkie was Alam Ara ( 1931 ) , several years after the first Hollywood musical talkie The Jazz Singer ( 1927 ) . Alongside commercial masala films , a distinctive genre of art films known as parallel cinema has also existed , presenting realistic content and avoidance of musical numbers ."
