  "intro": "Francis Xavier Velarde (1897-1961) was an English architect who practised in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. He trained at the Liverpool School of Architecture where he later taught. His works are mainly in Merseyside and Northwest England. His major works were churches. Although Pollard and Pevsner state that he worked exclusively for the Roman Catholic Church, he did design one Anglican church, St Gabriel, Blackburn. Velarde also designed Roman Catholic schools. This list includes some of his major works."
