  "/wiki/US_4_(NY)": "U.S. Route 4 ( US 4 ) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from East Greenbush , New York , to Portsmouth , New Hampshire . In the U.S. state of New York , US 4 extends 79.67 miles ( 128.22 km ) from an intersection with US 9 and US 20 in East Greenbush to the Vermont state line northeast of Whitehall . While the remainder of US 4 east of New York is an east-west route , US 4 in New York is signed north-south due to the alignment the route takes through the state . The portion of the route between Waterford and Whitehall is part of the Lakes to Locks Passage , an All-American Road . The route runs along the Hudson River from Troy to Hudson Falls and the Champlain Canal from Fort Ann to Whitehall . It passes through several riverside and canalside communities , including two cities ( Troy and Mechanicville ) and seven villages . US 4 crosses several major east-west highways as it proceeds north , such as Interstate 90 ( I-90 ) in East Greenbush , New York State Route 7 ( NY 7 ) in Troy , NY 29 in Schuylerville , and NY 149 in Fort Ann . It also overlaps with the north-south NY 22 for 6 miles ( 10 km ) from Comstock to Whitehall and with NY 32 for a total of 16 miles ( 26 km ) between Waterford and Bemis Heights and from Schuylerville to Northumberland . US 4 was assigned in 1926 and initially extended from Glens Falls to the Vermont border near Whitehall by way of Hudson Falls . The route utilized part of NY 6 and NY 30 , two highways assigned in 1924 . US 4 was extended southward to its present terminus in East Greenbush as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Much of US 4 south of Hudson Falls initially overlapped with other routes ; most of the overlaps were gradually eliminated during the 1940s and 1950s as the concurrent routes were eliminated or truncated .",

  "/wiki/NY_149": "New York State Route 149 ( NY 149 ) is an east-west state highway that runs for 32.20 miles ( 51.82 km ) through the Capital District of New York in the United States . It begins at exit 20 on the Adirondack Northway ( Interstate 87 or I-87 ) in the Warren County town of Queensbury and intersects U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) , US 4 , and NY 22 , among other routes , as it progresses eastward to its eastern end at the Vermont state line in the Washington County village of Granville . Here , the highway becomes Vermont Route 149 ( VT 149 ) and continues for an additional 1.302 miles ( 2.095 km ) to an intersection with VT 30 in Rutland County . Both NY 149 and VT 149 traverse mostly rural areas . NY 149 was assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and initially extended from NY 9L in Queensbury to NY 22 south of Granville by way of an east-west highway built during the first two decades of the 20th century . It was cut back to US 4 c. 1939 , but extended westward back to NY 9L in the mid-1950s . It was extended further west to US 9 in the late 1950s and to I-87 exit 20 c. 1962 . In the mid-1960s , NY 22 was rerouted to bypass Granville to the west . NY 149 was then extended to Vermont by way of NY 22 's former routing into the village and East Main Street . The short continuation of Granville 's East Main Street in Vermont , designated as Vermont Route 30B since 1935 , was renumbered to VT 149 in December 1966 to match the New York number .",

[ a ] Many of the state 's major east-west roads intersect with , and often join , NY 22 just before crossing into the neighboring New England states , where U.S. Route 7 ( US 7 ) , which originally partially followed NY 22 's alignment , similarly parallels the New York state line . Almost all of NY 22 is a two-lane rural road through small villages and hamlets . The exceptions are its southern end in the heavily populated Bronx and lower Westchester County , and a section that runs through the city of Plattsburgh near the northern end . The rural landscape that the road passes through varies from horse country and views of the reservoirs of the New York City watershed in the northern suburbs of the city , to dairy farms further upstate in the Taconic and Berkshire mountains , to the undeveloped , heavily forested Adirondack Park along the shores of Lake Champlain . An 86-mile ( 138 km ) section from Fort Ann to Keeseville is part of the All-American Road known as the Lakes to Locks Passage . The oldest portions of today 's NY 22 , in Westchester County and along the Lake Champlain shoreline , were Native American trails . Dutch , and after them English , settlers continued to use the road to get their farm products to market , with the southernmost portion eventually becoming the White Plains Post Road in the 18th and 19th centuries . In the early 20th century , as automobile use became widespread , the state paved the more heavily used sections and built new roads to create the current highway , first designated as NY 22 in 1930 . In its early years the highway began in Manhattan ; until 2008 its northern end was the Canadian border .",
