  "/wiki/3D_film": "A three-dimensional stereoscopic film ( also known as three-dimensional film , 3D film or S3D film ) is a motion picture that enhances the illusion of depth perception , hence adding a third dimension . The most common approach to the production of 3D films is derived from stereoscopic photography . In this approach , a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives ( or computer-generated imagery generates the two perspectives in post-production ) , and special projection hardware or eyewear is used to limit the visibility of each image to the viewer 's left or right eye only . 3D films are not limited to theatrical releases ; television broadcasts and direct-to-video films have also incorporated similar methods , especially since the advent of 3D television and Blu-ray 3D . 3D films have existed in some form since 1915 , but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film , and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business . Nonetheless , 3D films were prominently featured in the 1950s in American cinema , and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by IMAX high-end theaters and Disney-themed venues . 3D films became increasingly successful throughout the 2000s , peaking with the success of 3D presentations of Avatar in December 2009 , after which 3D films again decreased in popularity . Certain directors have also taken more experimental approaches to 3D filmmaking , most notably celebrated auteur Jean-Luc Godard in his films 3X3D and Goodbye to Language .",
