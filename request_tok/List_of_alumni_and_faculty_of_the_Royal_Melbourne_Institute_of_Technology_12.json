  "/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia": "The Parliament of Australia ( officially the Federal Parliament , also called the Commonwealth Parliament ) is the legislative branch of the government of Australia . It consists of three elements : the Crown ( represented by the Governor-General ) , the Senate and the House of Representatives . The combination of two elected chambers , in which the members of the Senate represent the states and territories while the members of the House represent electoral divisions according to population , is modelled on the United States Congress . Through both chambers , however , there is a fused executive , drawn from the Westminster system . The upper house , the Senate , consists of 76 members : twelve for each state , and two each for the territories , Northern Territory ( including Christmas Island and the Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands ) and the Australian Capital Territory ( including Norfolk Island and the Jervis Bay Territory ) . Senators are elected using the single transferable vote proportional representation system and as a result , the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power . The governing party or coalition has not held a majority in the Senate since 1981 ( except between 2005 and 2007 ) and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and Independents to get legislation passed . The lower house , the House of Representatives , currently consists of 151 members , each elected using full-preference instant-runoff voting from single-member constituencies known as electoral divisions ( and commonly referred to as electorates or seats ) . This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major political groups , the centre-right Coalition ( consisting of the Liberal and National Parties ) and the centre-left Labor Party . The government of the day must achieve the confidence of this House in order to gain and remain in power . The House of Representatives has a maximum term of three years , although it can be dissolved early . The Senate has fixed terms , with 36 Senators ' terms expiring every three years ( the terms of the four territory Senators are linked to House elections ) .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",

  "/wiki/Professor": "Professor ( commonly abbreviated as Prof. ) is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries . Literally , professor derives from Latin as a person who professes . Professors are usually experts in their field and teachers of the highest rank . In many systems of academic ranks , professor refers only to the most senior academic position , sometimes informally known as full professor . In some countries and institutions , the word professor is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor ; this is particularly the case in the United States . This colloquial usage would be considered incorrect among other academic communities . However , the unqualified title Professor designated with a capital letter nearly always refers to a full professor . Professors often conduct original research and commonly teach undergraduate , professional , or postgraduate courses in their fields of expertise . In universities with graduate schools , professors may mentor and supervise graduate students conducting research for a thesis or dissertation . In many universities , full professors take on senior managerial roles such as leading departments , research teams and institutes , and filling roles such as president , principal or vice-chancellor . The role of professor may be more public-facing than that of more junior staff , and professors are expected to be national or international leaders in their field of expertise .",

The Queen is usually represented by her governor-general . Before 1951 , there was an upper chamber , the New Zealand Legislative Council . The New Zealand Parliament was established in 1854 and is one of the oldest continuously functioning legislatures in the world . It has met in Wellington , the capital of New Zealand , since 1865 . The House of Representatives normally consists of 120 members of Parliament ( MPs ) , though sometimes more due to overhang seats . There are 71 MPs elected directly in electorate seats and the remainder are filled by list MPs based on each party 's share of the total party vote . M\u0101ori were represented in Parliament from 1867 , and in 1893 women gained the vote . Although elections can be called early , each three years Parliament is dissolved and goes up for reelection . Parliament is closely linked to the executive . The New Zealand Government comprises a prime minister ( head of government ) and other ministers . In accordance with the principle of responsible government , these individuals are always drawn from the House of Representatives , and are held accountable to it ."
