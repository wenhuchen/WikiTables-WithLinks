  "/wiki/Bryce_Canyon_National_Park,_Utah": "Bryce Canyon National Park ( /bra\u026as/ ) is an American national park located in southwestern Utah . The major feature of the park is Bryce Canyon , which despite its name , is not a canyon , but a collection of giant natural amphitheaters along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau . Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called hoodoos , formed by frost weathering and stream erosion of the river and lake bed sedimentary rocks . The red , orange , and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors . Bryce Canyon National Park is much smaller , and sits at a much higher elevation than nearby Zion National Park . The rim at Bryce varies from 8,000 to 9,000 feet ( 2,400 to 2,700 m ) . The Bryce Canyon area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was named after Ebenezer Bryce , who homesteaded in the area in 1874 . The area around Bryce Canyon was originally designated as a national monument by President Warren G. Harding in 1923 and was redesignated as a national park by Congress in 1928 . The park covers 35,835 acres ( 55.992 sq mi ; 14,502 ha ; 145.02 km2 ) and receives substantially fewer visitors than Zion National Park ( nearly 4.3 million in 2016 ) or Grand Canyon National Park ( nearly 6 million in 2016 ) , largely due to Bryce 's more remote location .
