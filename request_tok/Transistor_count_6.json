  "/wiki/Manchester_computers": "The Manchester computers were an innovative series of stored-program electronic computers developed during the 30-year period between 1947 and 1977 by a small team at the University of Manchester , under the leadership of Tom Kilburn . They included the world 's first stored-program computer , the world 's first transistorised computer , and what was the world 's fastest computer at the time of its inauguration in 1962 . The project began with two aims : to prove the practicality of the Williams tube , an early form of computer memory based on standard cathode ray tubes ( CRTs ) ; and to construct a machine that could be used to investigate how computers might be able to assist in the solution of mathematical problems . The first of the series , the Manchester Baby , ran its first program on 21 June 1948 . As the world 's first stored-program computer , the Baby , and the Manchester Mark 1 developed from it , quickly attracted the attention of the United Kingdom government , who contracted the electrical engineering firm of Ferranti to produce a commercial version . The resulting machine , the Ferranti Mark 1 , was the world 's first commercially available general-purpose computer . The collaboration with Ferranti eventually led to an industrial partnership with the computer company ICL , who made use of many of the ideas developed at the university , particularly in the design of their 2900 series of computers during the 1970s .",

  "/wiki/Point-contact_transistor": "The point-contact transistor was the first type of transistor to be successfully demonstrated . It was developed by research scientists John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at Bell Laboratories in December 1947 . They worked in a group led by physicist William Shockley . The group had been working together on experiments and theories of electric field effects in solid state materials , with the aim of replacing vacuum tubes with a smaller device that consumed less power . The critical experiment , carried out on December 16 , 1947 , consisted of a block of germanium , a semiconductor , with two very closely spaced gold contacts held against it by a spring . Brattain attached a small strip of gold foil over the point of a plastic triangle - a configuration which is essentially a point-contact diode . He then carefully sliced through the gold at the tip of the triangle . This produced two electrically isolated gold contacts very close to each other .",

The computer was built by Jean Howard Felker of Bell Labs for the United States Air Force while L.C . Brown ( Charlie Brown ) was a lead engineer on the project , which started in 1951 . The project initially examined the feasibility of constructing a transistorized airborne digital computer . A second application was a transistorized digital computer to be used in a Navy track-while-scan shipboard radar system . Several models were completed : TRADIC Phase One computer , Flyable TRADIC , Leprechaun ( using junction transistors in 1956 ) and XMH-3 TRADIC . TRADIC Phase One was developed to explore the feasibility , in the laboratory , of using transistors in a digital computer that could be used to solve aircraft bombing and navigation problems . Flyable TRADIC was used to establish the feasibility of using an airborne solid-state computer as the control element of a bombing and navigation system . Leprechaun was a second-generation laboratory research transistor digital computer designed to explore the capabilities of new solid-state devices for airborne computers . The TRADIC Phase One computer was completed in January 1954 . The TRADIC Phase One computer has been claimed to be the world 's first fully transistorized computer , ahead of the Mail\u00fcfterl in Austria or the Harwell CADET in the UK , which were each completed in 1955 . In the UK , the Manchester University Transistor Computer demonstrated a working prototype in 1953 which incorporated transistors before TRADIC was operational , although that was not a fully transistorized computer because it used vacuum tubes to generate the clock signal .",

  "/wiki/Discrete_transistor": "A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power . It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit . A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor 's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals . Because the controlled ( output ) power can be higher than the controlling ( input ) power , a transistor can amplify a signal . Today , some transistors are packaged individually , but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits . Austro-Hungarian physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed the concept of a field-effect transistor in 1926 , but it was not possible to actually construct a working device at that time . The first working device to be built was a point-contact transistor invented in 1947 by American physicists John Bardeen and Walter Brattain while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs . They shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement . The most widely used transistor is the MOSFET ( metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor ) , also known as the MOS transistor , which was invented by Egyptian engineer Mohamed Atalla with Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959 . The MOSFET was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses .

  "/wiki/Germanium": "Germanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ge and atomic number 32 . It is a lustrous , hard-brittle , grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group , chemically similar to its group neighbours silicon and tin . Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon . Like silicon , germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature . Because it seldom appears in high concentration , germanium was discovered comparatively late in the history of chemistry . Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth 's crust . In 1869 , Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table , and called the element ekasilicon . Nearly two decades later , in 1886 , Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur , in a rare mineral called argyrodite . Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance , the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev 's predictions for a relative of silicon . Winkler named the element after his country , Germany . Today , germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite ( the primary ore of zinc ) , though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver , lead , and copper ores .

The 7070 was expected to be a common successor to at least the 650 and the 705 . The 7070 was not designed to be instruction set compatible with the 650 , as the latter had a second jump address in every instruction to allow optimal use of the drum , something unnecessary and wasteful in a computer with random-access core memory . As a result , a simulator was needed to run old programs . The 7070 was also marketed as an IBM 705 upgrade , but failed miserably due to its incompatibilities , including an inability to fully represent the 705 character set ; forcing IBM to quickly introduce the IBM 7080 as a transistorized IBM 705 that was fully compatible .

  "/wiki/Alloy-junction_transistor": "The germanium alloy-junction transistor , or alloy transistor , was an early type of bipolar junction transistor , developed at General Electric and RCA in 1951 as an improvement over the earlier grown-junction transistor . The usual construction of an alloy-junction transistor is a germanium crystal forming the base , with emitter and collector alloy beads fused on opposite sides . Indium and antimony were commonly used to form the alloy junctions on a bar of N-type germanium . The collector junction pellet would be about 50 mils ( thousandths of an inch ) in diameter , and the emitter pellet about 20 mils .

  "/wiki/Integrated_circuit": "An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit ( also referred to as an IC , a chip , or a microchip ) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece ( or chip ) of semiconductor material that is normally silicon . The integration of large numbers of tiny MOS transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller , faster , and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components . The IC 's mass production capability , reliability , and building-block approach to circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors . ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics . Computers , mobile phones , and other digital home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies , made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs . Integrated circuits were made practical by technological advancements in metal-oxide-silicon ( MOS ) semiconductor device fabrication . Since their origins in the 1960s , the size , speed , and capacity of chips have progressed enormously , driven by technical advances that fit more and more MOS transistors on chips of the same size - a modern chip may have many billions of MOS transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail . These advances , roughly following Moore 's law , make computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s . ICs have two main advantages over discrete circuits : cost and performance . Cost is low because the chips , with all their components , are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time . Furthermore , packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits . Performance is high because the IC 's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and proximity .",

Variations of the original TTL circuit design offered higher speed or lower power dissipation to allow design optimization . TTL devices were originally made in ceramic and plastic dual-in-line ( DIP ) packages , and flat-pack form . TTL chips are now also made in surface-mount packages . TTL became the foundation of computers and other digital electronics . Even after Very-large-scale integration integrated circuits made multiple-circuit-board processors obsolete , TTL devices still found extensive use as the glue logic interfacing between more densely integrated components .",
  "/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer": "The Apollo Guidance Computer ( AGC ) is a digital computer produced for the Apollo program that was installed on board each Apollo command module ( CM ) and Apollo Lunar Module ( LM ) . The AGC provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance , navigation , and control of the spacecraft . The AGC has a 16-bit word length , with 15 data bits and one parity bit . Most of the software on the AGC is stored in a special read-only memory known as core rope memory , fashioned by weaving wires through and around magnetic cores , though a small amount of read/write core memory is available . Astronauts communicated with the AGC using a numeric display and keyboard called the DSKY ( for display and keyboard , pronounced DIS-kee ) . The AGC and its DSKY user interface were developed in the early 1960s for the Apollo program by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory and first flew in 1966 . The AGC was the first silicon integrated circuit based computer . The computer 's performance was comparable to the first generation of home computers from the late 1970s , such as the Apple II , TRS-80 , and Commodore PET .",
