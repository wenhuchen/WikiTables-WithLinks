  "/wiki/Sandhill_cranes": "The sandhill crane ( Antigone canadensis ) is a species of large crane of North America and extreme northeastern Siberia . The common name of this bird refers to habitat like that at the Platte River , on the edge of Nebraska 's Sandhills on the American Plains . This is the most important stopover area for the nominotypical subspecies , the lesser sandhill crane ( Antigone canadensis canadensis ) , with up to 450,000 of these birds migrating through annually . The sandhill crane was formerly placed in the genus Grus , but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus , as then defined , was polyphyletic . In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera , four species , including the sandhill crane , were placed in the resurrected genus Antigone that had originally been erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853 . The specific epithet canadensis is the modern Latin word for Canadian .",
  "/wiki/Platte_River": "The Platte River /pl\u00e6t/ is a major river in the state of Nebraska and is about 310 mi ( 500 km ) long . Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River , it flows for over 1,050 miles ( 1,690 km ) . The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River , which itself is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico . The Platte over most of its length is a muddy , broad , shallow , meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islands - a braided stream . These characteristics made it too difficult for canoe travel , and it was never used as a major navigation route by European-American trappers or explorers . [ citation needed ] The Platte is one of the most significant tributary systems in the watershed of the Missouri , draining a large portion of the central Great Plains in Nebraska and the eastern Rocky Mountains in Colorado and Wyoming . The river valley played an important role in the westward expansion of the United States , providing the route for several major emigrant trails , including the Oregon , California , Mormon and Bozeman trails . The first Europeans to see the Platte were French explorers and fur trappers about 1714 ; they first called it the Nebraskier ( Nebraska ) , a transliteration of the name given by the Otoe people , meaning flat water . This expression is very close to the French words rivi\u00e8re plate ( flat river ) , the probable origin of the name Platte River .",
