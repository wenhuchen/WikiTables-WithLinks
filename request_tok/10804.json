  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales": "Tropical cyclones are ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales , according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin ( s ) they are located in . Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones , but some alternative scales also exist , such as accumulated cyclone energy , the Power Dissipation Index , the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index , and the Hurricane Severity Index . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Northern Hemisphere are unofficially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales . Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms . Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane , then it will be classified on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale , which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period . In the Western Pacific , the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin , which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period . The India Meteorological Department 's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the North Indian Ocean , and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Southern Hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on one of two scales , which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds : The Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale is used to classify systems within the Australian or South Pacific tropical cyclone basin . The scale used to classify systems in the South-West Indian Ocean is defined by Meteo France for use in various French territories , including New Caledonia and French Polynesia . The definition of sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10 m ( 33 ft ) . However , the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period , at 10 m ( 33 ft ) above the surface . The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period , and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval .",
  "/wiki/1927_Pacific_typhoon_season": "In 1927 , there were 27 tropical cyclones observed in the western Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the 180th meridian . Many of these storms affected the Philippines , China , and Japan , collectively leaving 15,952 fatalities . The strongest storm of the year also had the lowest barometric pressure recorded in a tropical cyclone worldwide at the time . On August 18 , the Dutch steamship Sapoeroea recorded a barometric pressure of 886.7 millibar ( 26.185 inches of mercury ) about 740 kilometres ( 460 miles ) east of Luzon . This typhoon later struck near Hong Kong , where it halted transportation , wrecked buildings , and killed 15 people . The first storm of the year originated near the Caroline Islands on February 12 , which capsized the freighter Elkton and caused the loss of its crew of 36 people . Storms were observed in each subsequent month of the year . In May , a typhoon wrecked the passenger ferry SS Negros near the Philippine province of Romblon , killing 108 people . A typhoon in July killed around 10,000 people in China , mostly related to mountain flooding near Zhangzhou , leaving around 100,000 people homeless . A month later , another landfalling typhoon in China killed about 5,000 people and damaged nearly 20,000 houses . In September , an intense typhoon moved through Japan around the same time that an undersea earthquake affected the region ; the concurrent disasters killed about 600 people , after a 3 metre ( 10 foot ) tsunami washed away boats and houses along the coast . Another Chinese typhoon in September killed 5,000 people .",
  "/wiki/1949_Pacific_typhoon_season": "The 1949 Pacific typhoon season is an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation , in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean . The season runs throughout 1949 , though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October . The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100\u00b0E and 180th meridian . Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean , there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h ( 40 mph ) anywhere in the basin , whilst the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135\u00b0E and 115\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N-25\u00b0N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA . Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States ' Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) are given a number with a W suffix .",

  "/wiki/1951_Pacific_typhoon_season": "The 1951 Pacific typhoon season was a generally below average season with multiple tropical cyclones striking the Philippines . With the exception of January , each month saw at least one tropical system develop ; October was the most active month with four tropical cyclones forming . Overall , there were 21 tropical depressions , of which 17 became named storms ; of those , there were 16 typhoons . The season began with the formation of a short-lived unnamed tropical storm on February 19 , well east of the Philippines ; Typhoon Georgia became the season 's first named storm and typhoon after first developing in the open Pacific on March 20 . In April , Typhoon Iris developed before intensifying into a super typhoon the following month ; Iris was the first recorded instance of a Category 5-equivalent typhoon in the western Pacific . The final typhoon and storm of the year was Typhoon Babs , which remained at sea before dissipating on December 17 . The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 1951 Pacific hurricane season . At the time , tropical storms that formed within this region of the western Pacific were named and identified by the United States Fleet Weather Center in Guam . However , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) , which was established five years later , identified four additional tropical cyclones during the season not tracked by the Fleet Weather Center ; these analyzed systems did not receive names .",

  "/wiki/Typhoon_Ida_(1958)": "Typhoon Ida , also known as the Kanogawa Typhoon ( \u72e9\u91ce\u5ddd\u53f0\u98a8 , Kanogawa Taif\u016b ) , was the sixth-deadliest typhoon to hit Japan , as well as one of the strongest tropical cyclones on record . On September 20 , Ida formed in the Western Pacific near Guam . It moved to the west and rapidly intensified into a 115 mph ( 185 km/h ) typhoon by the next day . On September 22 , Ida turned to the north and continued its quick rate of intensification . Two days later , the Hurricane Hunters observed a minimum barometric pressure of 877 mb ( 25.9 inHg ) , as well as estimated peak winds of 325 km/h ( 200 mph ) . This made Ida the strongest tropical cyclone on record at the time , although it was surpassed by Typhoon June 17 years later . Ida weakened as it continued to the north-northeast , and made landfall in Japan on southeastern Honsh\u016b with winds of 80 mph on September 26 . It became extratropical the next day , and dissipated on the 28th to the east of the country . Ida caused torrential flooding to southeastern Japan , resulting in over 1,900 mudslides . Damage was estimated at $ 50 million , and there were 1,269 fatalities .",

  "/wiki/Typhoon_Vera": "Typhoon Vera , also known as the Isewan Typhoon ( \u4f0a\u52e2\u6e7e\u53f0\u98a8 , Ise-wan Taif\u016b ) , was an exceptionally intense tropical cyclone that struck Japan in September 1959 , becoming the strongest and deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall on the country . The storm 's intensity resulted in catastrophic damage of unparalleled severity and extent , and was a major setback to the Japanese economy , which was still recovering from World War II . In the aftermath of Vera , Japan 's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed , and the typhoon 's effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking the country . Vera developed on September 20 between Guam and Chuuk State , and initially tracked westward before taking a more northerly course , reaching tropical storm strength the following day . By this point Vera had assumed a more westerly direction of movement and had begun to rapidly intensify , and reached its peak intensity on September 23 with maximum sustained winds equivalent to that of a modern-day Category 5 hurricane . With little change in strength , Vera curved and accelerated northward , resulting in a landfall on September 26 near Shionomisaki on Honshu . Atmospheric wind patterns caused the typhoon to briefly emerge into the Sea of Japan before recurving eastward and moving ashore Honshu for a second time . Movement over land greatly weakened Vera , and after reentering the North Pacific Ocean later that day , Vera transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 27 ; these remnants continued to persist for an additional two days . Though Vera was accurately forecast and its track into Japan was well anticipated , limited coverage of telecommunications , combined with lack of urgency from Japanese media and the storm 's intensity , greatly inhibited potential evacuation and disaster mitigation processes . Rainfall from the storm 's outer rainbands began to cause flooding in river basins well in advance of the storm 's landfall . Upon moving ashore Honshu , the typhoon brought a strong storm surge that destroyed numerous flood defense systems , inundating coastal regions and sinking ships . Damage totals from Vera reached US $ 600 million ( equivalent to US $ 5.26 billion in 2019 ) .",

  "/wiki/Typhoon_Karen": "Typhoon Karen was the most powerful tropical cyclone to strike the island of Guam , and has been regarded as one of the most destructive events in the island 's history . It was first identified as a tropical disturbance on November 6 , 1962 , well to the southeast of Truk . Over the following two days , the system tracked generally northward and quickly intensified . Karen became a tropical storm late on November 7 , and within two days it explosively intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale . Turning westward , the typhoon maintained its intensity and struck Guam with winds of 280 km/h ( 175 mph ) on November 11 . Once clear of the island , it strengthened slightly and reached its peak intensity on November 13 with winds of 295 km/h ( 185 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 894 mb ( hPa ; 26.40 inHg ) . The storm then gradually turned northward as it weakened , brushing the Ryukyu Islands on November 15 , before moving east-northeastward over the open waters of the Pacific . Karen continued to weaken and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 17 before losing its identity the following day between Alaska and Hawaii . Karen devastated Guam with wind gusts estimated up to 280 km/h ( 185 mph ) . Ninety-five percent of homes were damaged or destroyed , leaving at least 45,000 people homeless . Communication and utilities were crippled , forcing officials to set up water distribution centers to prevent disease . Total losses on the island amounted to $ 250 million .",
