  "/wiki/B\u00e4renfang": "B\u00e4renfang or Meschkinnes is a German honey-flavoured liqueur based on vodka . It is usually called B\u00e4renj\u00e4ger in English-speaking countries . B\u00e4renfang means bear trap ; B\u00e4renj\u00e4ger means bear hunter . Meschkinnes , a term mostly used by people from East Prussia , comes from Lithuanian me\u0161kinas , meaning male bear . B\u00e4renfang has an alcohol content of 30-45% ABV ( 60-90 proof ) . In Germany , B\u00e4renfang is often made at home since the basic recipe and many variations of it are readily available . Most homemade B\u00e4renfang is based on vodka , but some recipes with a higher alcohol content are based on neutral spirit . B\u00e4renfang is always made with honey from nectar because honey from honeydew may have a bitter aftertaste .",
  "/wiki/Honey": "Honey is a sweet , viscous food substance made by bees and some related insects . Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants ( floral nectar ) or from secretions of other insects ( such as honeydew ) , by regurgitation , enzymatic activity , and water evaporation . Bees store honey in wax structures called honeycombs . The variety of honey produced by honey bees ( the genus Apis ) is the best-known , due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption . Honey is collected from wild bee colonies , or from hives of domesticated bees , a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture . Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose , and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose ( table sugar ) . It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener . Most microorganisms do not grow in honey , so sealed honey does not spoil , even after thousands of years . One tablespoonful ( 15 ml ) of honey provides 46 calories ( kcal ) of energy . Honey is regarded as safe when not taken in excessive amounts . Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity . Several cave paintings in Cuevas de la Ara\u00f1a in Spain depict humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago .",
  "/wiki/Borscht": "Borscht ( English : /\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0r\u0283 , \u02c8b\u0254\u02d0r\u0283t/ ( listen ) ) is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia . In English , the word borscht is most often associated with the soup 's variant of Ukrainian origin , one of the most famous dishes of Ukrainian cuisine , made with beetroots as one of the main ingredients , which give the dish its distinctive red color . The same name , however , is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots , such as sorrel-based green borscht , rye-based white borscht and cabbage borscht . Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems , leaves and umbels of common hogweed ( Heracleum sphondylium ) , a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows , which lent the dish its Slavic name . With time , it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups , among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular . It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with saut\u00e9ed vegetables , which - as well as beetroots - usually include cabbage , carrots , onions , potatoes and tomatoes . Depending on the recipe , borscht may include meat or fish , or be purely vegetarian ; it may be served either hot or cold ; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth drink . It is often served with smetana or sour cream , hard-boiled eggs or potatoes , but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes , such as uszka or pampushky , that can be served with the soup . Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire , and - by way of migration - to other continents . In North America , borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites , the groups who first brought it there from Europe . Several ethnic groups claim borscht , in its various local guises , as their own national dish consumed as part of ritual meals within Eastern Orthodox , Greek Catholic , Roman Catholic , and Jewish religious traditions .",
  "/wiki/Smetana_(dairy_product)": "Smetana is a type of sour cream from Central and Eastern Europe . It is a dairy product produced by souring heavy cream .

  "/wiki/Ukrainian_cuisine": "Ukrainian cuisine is the collection of the various cooking traditions of the Ukrainian people accumulated over many years . The cuisine is heavily influenced by the rich dark soil ( chornozem ) from which its ingredients come and often involves many components . The national dish of Ukraine that undeniably originates from the country is borsch . However varenyky and holubtsi are also considered national favourites of the Ukrainian people and are a common meal in traditional Ukrainian restaurants . Often referred to as the breadbasket of Europe the Ukrainian cuisine emphasises the importance of wheat and grain to the Ukrainian people and its often tumultuous history with it . The majority of Ukrainian dishes descend from ancient peasant dishes based on plentiful grain resources such as rye as well as staple vegetables such as potato , cabbages , mushrooms and beetroots . Ukrainian dishes incorporate both traditional Slavic techniques as well as other European techniques , a by product of years of foreign jurisdiction and influence . The Ukrainian cuisine incorporates a variety of different food branches ( carbohydrates , fats , protein , fruits and vegetables ) due to the large size of the country and the plentiful edible resources . Traditional Ukrainian dishes often experience a complex heating process - at first they are fried or boiled , and then stewed or baked . This is the most distinctive feature of Ukrainian cuisine .",

After being largely destroyed in World War II by Allied bombing and the Red Army , it was annexed by the Soviet Union and its surviving inhabitants forcibly expelled . Thereafter , the city was renamed Kaliningrad . Few traces of the former K\u00f6nigsberg remain today . The literal meaning of K\u00f6nigsberg is 'Kings Hill ' .

  "/wiki/Kopskiekelwein": "Kopskiekelwein was a currant wine produced in the former German province of East Prussia . The wine was made from either blackcurrants or redcurrants , and was usually fermented with Burgundy yeast . Kopskiekelwein took its name from the jocular saying that whoever became too fond of the drink would fall down headfirst - or kopskiekel in the old Low Prussian dialect . Popular pubs where the wine was available included the forester 's lodge in Moditten and the Four Brothers Inn ( Vierbr\u00fcderkrug ) in Metgethen , both located in the suburbs of K\u00f6nigsberg .

  "/wiki/Tilsiter_cheese": "Tilsit cheese or Tilsiter cheese is a light yellow semihard smear-ripened cheese , created in the mid-19th century by Prussian-Swiss settlers , the Westphal family , from the Emmental valley . The original buildings from the cheese plant still exist in Sovetsk , Russia , formerly Tilsit , on the Neman River , formerly Memel , in the former German province of East Prussia . The same ingredients to make the cheese were not available as in their home country , and the cheese became colonized by different moulds , yeasts , and bacteria in the humid climate . The result was a cheese that was more intense and full-flavoured . The settlers named the cheese after Tilsit , the Prussian town where they had settled . Tilsiter has a medium-firm texture with irregular holes or cracks . Commercially produced Tilsiter is made from pasteurized cow 's milk , ranges from 30 to 60% milk fat , and has a dark yellow rind . After the main part of its production , the cheese needs to rest for an additional 2 months . Often flavoured with caraway seed and peppercorns , Tilsiter is a complement to hearty brown/rye breads and dark beers . It is a common table cheese , yet versatile . Tilsit can be eaten cubed in salads , melted in sauces , on potatoes , in flans , or on burgers . Using the reimported recipe , Tilsiter has been manufactured in Switzerland since 1893 and in Germany since 1920 , where it is known as the protected brand Holsteiner Tilsiter ."
