  "/wiki/Monkey": "Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals , in part , the simians of infraorder Simiiformes . The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates , such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys . Many monkey species are tree-dwelling ( arboreal ) , although there are species that live primarily on the ground , such as baboons . Most species are also active during the day ( diurnal ) . Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent , especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini . Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago . New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago . Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago . Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [ 35-32 million years ago ] , eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists . Lemurs , lorises , and galagos are not monkeys ; instead they are strepsirrhine primates . Like monkeys , tarsiers are haplorhine primates ; however , they are also not monkeys . Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini , so cladistically they are monkeys as well .",

There are also several multiplayer modes : independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game .

The game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the North American market . Hiroshi Yamauchi , Nintendo 's president at the time , assigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto . Drawing from a wide range of inspirations , including Popeye , Beauty and the Beast , and King Kong , Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo 's chief engineer , Gunpei Yokoi . The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization , including cutscenes to advance the game 's plot and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay .

The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers , a conjoined pair of paddle controllers , and a game cartridge : initially Combat , and later Pac-Man . The Atari VCS launched with nine simple , low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges . The system found its killer app with its version of Taito 's Space Invaders in 1980 and became widely successful , leading to the creation of Activision and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco . By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983-84 , games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for , such as Pitfall ! and its scrolling sequel Pitfall II : Lost Caverns . Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600 , Pac-Man and E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , that became commercial failures and contributed to the video game crash of 1983 which ended the market relevance of the 2600 . Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel .

It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom , France , Spain , and the German-speaking parts of Europe . The series spawned a total of six distinct models : The CPC464 , CPC664 , and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market . The later 464plus and 6128plus , intended to prolong the system 's lifecycle with hardware updates , were considerably less successful , as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000 . The CPC models ' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU , complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM . Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device , either a compact cassette deck or 3 inch floppy disk drive . The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour , green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit 's power supply . Additionally , a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives , printers , and memory extensions , was available . The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software . The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor , its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users , which was reflected by a wide selection of application software . During its lifetime , the CPC series sold approximately three million units .",

All of the machines in the family are technically similar and differ primarily in packaging . They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz , [ a ] and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips . This architecture enabled graphics and sound capabilities more advanced than most contemporary machines , and gaming on the platform was a major draw . The first-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform 's killer app . The systems launched with a series of plug and play peripherals that used the Atari SIO serial bus system , an early analog of USB . [ b ] To meet stringent FCC requirements , much of the circuitry of the original machines is enclosed in a cast aluminum block , which made them physically robust but expensive to produce . The 400 and 800 were replaced by the XL series in 1983 , then-after the company was sold and reestablished as Atari Corporation-the XE models in 1985 . The XL and XE are lighter in construction and less expensive to build , while also having Atari BASIC built-in and reducing the number of joystick ports from 4 to 2 . The 130XE , released in 1985 , increased the memory to 128K of bank-switched RAM .

With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation , the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware . The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s . For a substantial period ( 1983-1986 ) , the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year , outselling IBM PC compatibles , Apple computers , and the Atari 8-bit family of computers . Sam Tramiel , a later Atari president and the son of Commodore 's founder , said in a 1989 interview , When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years . In the UK market , the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum , but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK . Part of the Commodore 64 's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores . Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs , including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology . It has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production .",

Microsoft marketed the device as an all-in-one entertainment system , hence the name 'Xbox One ' . The Xbox One mainly competes against Sony 's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo 's Wii U and Switch . Moving away from its predecessor 's PowerPC-based architecture , the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox ; it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit ( APU ) built around the x86-64 instruction set . Xbox One 's controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360 's , with a redesigned body , D-pad , and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback . The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing , as well as social networking features , and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay , or live-stream directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch . Games can also be played off-console via a local area network on supported Windows 10 devices . The console can play Blu-ray Disc , and overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide . The console optionally included a redesigned Kinect sensor , marketed as the Kinect 2.0 , providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition .",
  "/wiki/League_of_Legends": "League of Legends ( LoL ) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows and macOS . Inspired by the Warcraft III : The Frozen Throne mod Defense of the Ancients , the game follows a freemium model and is supported by microtransactions . In League of Legends , players assume the role of a champion with unique abilities and battle against a team of other player- or computer-controlled champions . The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team 's Nexus , a structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures , although other distinct game modes exist as well with varying objectives , rules , and maps . Each League of Legends match is discrete , with all champions starting off relatively weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game . Champions span a variety of roles and blend a variety of fantasy tropes , such as sword and sorcery , steampunk , and Lovecraftian horror . Although the discrete nature of each match prohibits an overarching narrative in-game , the various champions make up a large and ever-evolving fictional universe developed by Riot Games through short stories , comics , cinematics , and books . Riot Games was founded by Brandon Ryze Beck and Marc Tryndamere Merill , former business students and roommates at the University of Southern California , in Los Angeles in September of 2006 . Citing a dissatisfaction with their post-college careers and the business practices of contemporary video game developers , they decided to create their own company dedicated to making free-to-play games that constantly evolved and developed through player feedback . Beck and Merill recruited Defense of the Ancients veteran Steve Guinsoo Feak , as well as several other experienced developers , to help them build and refine the game that would later become League of Legends . Development , originally under the name Onslaught , was difficult , owing to technical limitations and Beck and Merill 's conflicting visions with many publishers at the time . They eventually partnered with Chinese conglomerate Tencent , which now fully owns the game and a majority share of the company 's stock .",
  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries .",

The Monkey King 's origins predate the novel and can be traced back to the Song dynasty . In the novel , he is a monkey born from a stone who acquires supernatural powers through Taoist practices .

  "/wiki/Journey_to_the_West": "Journey to the West ( Chinese : \u897f\u904a\u8a18 ; pinyin : X\u012b Y\u00f3u J\u00ec ) is a Chinese novel published in the 16th century during the Ming dynasty and attributed to Wu Cheng'en . It is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature . Arthur Waley 's popular abridged translation , Monkey , is well known in English-speaking countries . The novel is an extended account of the legendary pilgrimage of the Tang dynasty Buddhist monk Xuanzang who traveled to the Western Regions , that is , Central Asia and India , to obtain Buddhist sacred texts ( s\u016btras ) and returned after many trials and much suffering . It retains the broad outline of Xuanzang 's own account , Great Tang Records on the Western Regions , but the Ming dynasty novel adds elements from folk tales and the author 's invention , that is , that Gautama Buddha gave this task to the monk ( referred to as Tang Sanzang in the novel ) and provided him with three protectors who agree to help him as an atonement for their sins . These disciples are Sun Wukong , Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing , together with a dragon prince who acts as Tang Sanzang 's steed , a white horse . Journey to the West has strong roots in Chinese folk religion , Chinese mythology , Confucianist , Taoist and Buddhist philosophy , and the pantheon of Taoist immortals and Buddhist bodhisattvas are still reflective of some Chinese religious attitudes today . Enduringly popular , the tale is at once a comic adventure story , a humorous satire of Chinese bureaucracy , a spring of spiritual insight , and an extended allegory in which the group of pilgrims journeys towards enlightenment by the power and virtue of cooperation .",
  "/wiki/Warframe": "Warframe is a free-to-play action role playing third-person shooter multiplayer online game developed and published by Digital Extremes . Originally released for Windows personal computers in March 2013 following a beta period , it was ported to the PlayStation 4 in November 2013 , the Xbox One in September 2014 , and the Nintendo Switch in November 2018 . In Warframe , players control members of the Tenno , a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep far into Earth 's future to find themselves at war in the planetary system with different factions . The Tenno use their powered Warframes along with a variety of weapons and abilities to complete missions . While many of the game 's missions use procedurally-generated levels , newer updates have included large open world areas similar to other massively multiplayer online games as well as some story-specific missions with fixed level design . The game includes elements of shooting and melee games , parkour , and role-playing to allow players to advance their Tenno with improved gear . The game includes both player versus environment and player versus player elements . It is supported by microtransactions , which lets players purchase in-game items using real money , but also offers the option to earn them at no cost through grinding . The concepts for Warframe originated in 2000 , when Digital Extremes began work on a new game titled Dark Sector . At the time , the company had been successful in supporting other developers and publishers , and wanted to develop their own game in-house . The game suffered several delays and was eventually released in 2008 , having used some of the initial framework but far different from the original plan . By 2012 , in the wake of the success of free-to-play games , the developers took their earlier Dark Sector ideas and art assets and incorporated them into a new project , their self-published Warframe .",

  "/wiki/Arcade_game": "An arcade game or coin-op game is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants , bars and amusement arcades . Most arcade games are video games , pinball machines , electro-mechanical games , redemption games or merchandisers . While exact dates are debated , the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s . Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s , the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost . The Eastern Hemisphere retains a strong arcade industry ."
