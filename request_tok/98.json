The International Olympic Committee verified this , and in Oslo in September 1974 , Haug 's daughter presented the medal to the 86-year-old Haugen .",

Roald Larsen 's parents were Hans Jacob Larsen , a glazier born in Kristiania in 1870 , and Lydia Larsen , born in Porsgrunn in 1865 . They had four children , all sons : Jaan Harald ( 1891 ) , Lyder Ragnar ( 1895 ) , Roald Morel ( 1898 ) , and Gelgjermo Stone ( 1899 ) . Representing Kristiania Sk\u00f8iteklub ( now Oslo Sk\u00f8iteklub ) , Larsen had his best year in 1924 , when he became World Allround , European Allround , and Norwegian Allround Champion , in addition to winning two silver and three bronze medals at the 1924 Winter Olympics of Chamonix . One of those Olympic silver medals was on the allround event , a combination of the results of the 500 m , the 1500 m , the 5000 m , and the 10000 m - the only time in Olympic history that there was an allround event . Larsen won several more medals in the years that followed , including another bronze medal at the 1928 Winter Olympics of St. Moritz . Larsen often had to admit defeat to Clas Thunberg . This is illustrated by the fact that at none of the six events in which Larsen won an Olympic medal he managed to finish ahead of Thunberg . After 1928 , Larsen 's appearances and successes quickly became less , although he kept competing occasionally until 1936 . After retiring from speed skating , Larsen followed in his father 's footsteps and became a full-time glazier . He founded the glazier company Roald Larsen AS in Oslo in 1937 .",
