Six orbiters were built for flight : Enterprise , Columbia , Challenger , Discovery , Atlantis , and Endeavour . All were built in Palmdale , California , by the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania-based Rockwell International company . The first orbiter , Enterprise , made its maiden flight in 1977 . An unpowered glider , it was carried by a modified Boeing 747 airliner called the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and released for a series of atmospheric test flights and landings . Enterprise was partially disassembled and retired after completion of critical testing . The remaining orbiters were fully operational spacecraft , and were launched vertically as part of the Space Shuttle stack . Columbia was the first space-worthy orbiter , and made its inaugural flight in 1981 . Challenger , Discovery , and Atlantis followed in 1983 , 1984 and 1985 respectively .

The phrase generally refers to descendants of enslaved black people who are from the United States . African Americans constitute the third largest ethnic group and the second largest racial group in the US , after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans . Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States . On average , African Americans are of West/Central African and European descent , and some also have Native American ancestry .

The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities ( \u224895% ) . Immigrants from some Caribbean , Central American , and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term . African-American history starts in the 16th century , with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America , and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America . After the founding of the United States , black people continued to be enslaved , and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865 . Due to notions of white supremacy , they were treated as second-class citizens . The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only , and only white men who owned property could vote .",

Mir was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996 . It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft . At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit , succeeded by the International Space Station ( ISS ) after Mir 's orbit decayed . The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology , human biology , physics , astronomy , meteorology , and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space . Mir was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and held the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days , until it was surpassed by the ISS on 23 October 2010 . It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight , with Valeri Polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995 . Mir was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan , having the capacity to support a resident crew of three , or larger crews for short visits . Following the success of the Salyut programme , Mir represented the next stage in the Soviet Union 's space station programme . The first module of the station , known as the core module or base block , was launched in 1986 and followed by six further modules .

Kennedy Space Center ( KSC , originally known as the NASA Launch Operations Center ) , located in Merritt Island , Florida , is one of ten National Aeronautics and Space Administration field centers . Since December 1968 , KSC has been NASA 's primary launch center of human spaceflight . Launch operations for the Apollo , Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC . Located on the east coast of Florida , KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ( CCAFS ) . The management of the two entities work very closely together , share resources , and even own facilities on each other 's property . Though the first Apollo flights and all Project Mercury and Project Gemini flights took off from CCAFS , the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization , the Launch Operations Directorate . Starting with the fourth Gemini mission , the NASA launch control center in Florida ( Mercury Control Center , later the Launch Control Center ) began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center in Houston , shortly after liftoff ; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission . Additionally , the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions and researches food production and In-Situ Resource Utilization for off-Earth exploration . Since 2010 , the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships , even adding a new launch pad ( LC-39C ) in 2015 . There are about 700 facilities and buildings grouped across the center 's 144,000 acres ( 580 km2 ) .
