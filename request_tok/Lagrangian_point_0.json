  "/wiki/International_Cometary_Explorer": "The International Cometary Explorer ( ICE ) spacecraft ( designed and launched as the International Sun-Earth Explorer-3 ( ISEE-3 ) satellite ) , was launched August 12 , 1978 , into a heliocentric orbit . It was one of three spacecraft , along with the mother/daughter pair of ISEE-1 and ISEE-2 , built for the International Sun-Earth Explorer ( ISEE ) program , a joint effort by NASA and ESRO/ESA to study the interaction between the Earth 's magnetic field and the solar wind . ISEE-3 was the first spacecraft to be placed in a halo orbit at the L1 Earth-Sun Lagrangian point . Renamed ICE , it became the first spacecraft to visit a comet , passing through the plasma tail of comet Giacobini-Zinner within about 7,800 km ( 4,800 mi ) of the nucleus on September 11 , 1985 . NASA suspended routine contact with ISEE-3 in 1997 , and made brief status checks in 1999 and 2008 . On May 29 , 2014 , two-way communication with the spacecraft was reestablished by the ISEE-3 Reboot Project , an unofficial group with support from the Skycorp company . On July 2 , 2014 , they fired the thrusters for the first time since 1987 . However , later firings of the thrusters failed , apparently due to a lack of nitrogen pressurant in the fuel tanks . The project team initiated an alternative plan to use the spacecraft to collect scientific data and send it back to Earth , but on September 16 , 2014 , contact with the probe was lost .",
  "/wiki/NASA": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA , /\u02c8n\u00e6s\u0259/ ) is an independent agency of the United States Federal Government responsible for the civilian space program , as well as aeronautics and aerospace research . [ note 1 ] NASA was established in 1958 , succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) . The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation , encouraging peaceful applications in space science . Since its establishment , most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA , including the Apollo Moon landing missions , the Skylab space station , and later the Space Shuttle . NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle , the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles . The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches . NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System ; advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate 's Heliophysics Research Program ; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons ; and researching astrophysics topics , such as the Big Bang , through the Great Observatories and associated programs .",
  "/wiki/Halo_orbit": "A halo orbit is a periodic , three-dimensional orbit near the L1 , L2 or L3 Lagrange point in the three-body problem of orbital mechanics . Although the Lagrange point is just a point in empty space , its peculiar characteristic is that it can be orbited . Halo orbits can be thought of as resulting from an interaction between the gravitational pull of the two planetary bodies and the Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations on a spacecraft . Halo orbits exist in any three-body system , e.g. , the Sun-Earth-Orbiting Satellite system or the Earth-Moon-Orbiting Satellite system . Continuous families of both Northern and Southern halo orbits exist at each Lagrange point . Because halo orbits tend to be unstable , stationkeeping is required to keep a satellite on the orbit . Most satellites in halo orbit serve scientific purposes , for example as space telescopes .",

  "/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory": "Deep Space Climate Observatory ( DSCOVR ; formerly known as Triana , unofficially known as GoreSat ) is a NOAA space weather , space climate , and Earth observation satellite . It was launched by SpaceX on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle on February 11 , 2015 , from Cape Canaveral . This is NOAA 's first operational deep space satellite and became its primary system of warning Earth in the event of solar magnetic storms . DSCOVR was originally proposed as an Earth observation spacecraft positioned at the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point , providing live video of the sunlit side of the planet through the Internet as well as science instruments to study climate change . Political changes in the United States resulted in the mission 's cancellation , and in 2001 the spacecraft was placed into storage . Proponents of the mission continued to push for its reinstatement , and a change in presidential administration in 2009 resulted in DSCOVR being taken out of storage and refurbished , and its mission was refocused to solar observation and early warning of coronal mass ejections while still providing Earth observation and climate monitoring . It launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on February 11 , 2015 , and reached L1 on June 8 , 2015 . NOAA operates DSCOVR from its Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland , Maryland . The acquired space data that allows for accurate weather forecasts are carried out in the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder , Colorado . Archival records are held by the National Centers for Environmental Information , and processing of Earth sensor data is carried out by NASA . DSCOVR has been in a directed safe hold since June 2019 due to an anomaly in the laser gyroscope of the Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit ( MIMU ) . Operators have been working on a software patch that will allow DSCOVR to operate without a laser gyroscope using only the star tracker for angular rate information .",

  "/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe": "The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) , originally known as the Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( MAP ) , was a spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 which measured temperature differences across the sky in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) - the radiant heat remaining from the Big Bang . Headed by Professor Charles L. Bennett of Johns Hopkins University , the mission was developed in a joint partnership between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University . The WMAP spacecraft was launched on June 30 , 2001 from Florida . The WMAP mission succeeded the COBE space mission and was the second medium-class ( MIDEX ) spacecraft in the NASA Explorers program . In 2003 , MAP was renamed WMAP in honor of cosmologist David Todd Wilkinson ( 1935-2002 ) , who had been a member of the mission 's science team . After nine years of operations , WMAP was switched off in 2010 , following the launch of the more advanced Planck spacecraft by ESA in 2009 . WMAP 's measurements played a key role in establishing the current Standard Model of Cosmology : the Lambda-CDM model . The WMAP data are very well fit by a universe that is dominated by dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant . Other cosmological data are also consistent , and together tightly constrain the Model . In the Lambda-CDM model of the universe , the age of the universe is 13.772\u00b10.059 billion years . The WMAP mission 's determination of the age of the universe is to better than 1% precision .

Herschel was the fourth and final cornerstone mission in the Horizon 2000 programme , following SOHO/Cluster II , XMM-Newton and Rosetta . NASA is a partner in the Herschel mission , with US participants contributing to the mission ; providing mission-enabling instrument technology and sponsoring the NASA Herschel Science Center ( NHSC ) at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center and the Herschel Data Search at the Infrared Science Archive . The observatory was carried into orbit in May 2009 , reaching the second Lagrangian point ( L2 ) of the Earth-Sun system , 1,500,000 kilometres ( 930,000 mi ) from Earth , about two months later . Herschel is named after Sir William Herschel , the discoverer of the infrared spectrum and planet Uranus , and his sister and collaborator Caroline Herschel . The observatory was capable of seeing the coldest and dustiest objects in space ; for example , cool cocoons where stars form and dusty galaxies just starting to bulk up with new stars . The observatory sifted through star-forming clouds - the slow cookers of star ingredients - to trace the path by which potentially life-forming molecules , such as water , form . The telescope 's lifespan was governed by the amount of coolant available for its instruments ; when that coolant ran out , the instruments would stop functioning correctly . At the time of its launch , operations were estimated to last 3.5 years ( to around the end of 2012 ) . It continued to operate until 29 April 2013 15:20 UTC , when Herschel ran out of coolant .",
  "/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)": "Planck was a space observatory operated by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) from 2009 to 2013 , which mapped the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) at microwave and infra-red frequencies , with high sensitivity and small angular resolution . The mission substantially improved upon observations made by the NASA Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) . Planck provided a major source of information relevant to several cosmological and astrophysical issues , such as testing theories of the early Universe and the origin of cosmic structure . Since the end of its mission , Planck has defined the most precise measurements of several key cosmological parameters , including the average density of ordinary matter and dark matter in the Universe and the age of the universe . The project was started around 1996 and was initially called COBRAS/SAMBA : the Cosmic Background Radiation Anisotropy Satellite/Satellite for Measurement of Background Anisotropies . It was later renamed in honour of the German physicist Max Planck ( 1858-1947 ) , who derived the formula for black-body radiation . Built at the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center by Thales Alenia Space , and created as a medium-sized mission for ESA 's Horizon 2000 long-term scientific programme , Planck was launched in May 2009 . It reached the Earth/Sun L2 point by July 2009 , and by February 2010 it had successfully started a second all-sky survey . On 21 March 2013 , the mission 's first all-sky map of the cosmic microwave background was released with an additional expanded release including polarization data in February 2015 . The final papers by the Planck team were released in July 2018 . At the end of its mission Planck was put into a heliocentric orbit and passivated to prevent it from endangering any future missions .

The mission aims to construct by far the largest and most precise 3D space catalog ever made , totalling approximately 1 billion astronomical objects , mainly stars , but also planets , comets , asteroids and quasars among others . The spacecraft will monitor each of its target objects about 70 times over the first five years of the mission to study the precise position and motion of each target , and will keep doing so . The spacecraft has enough micro-propulsion fuel to operate until about November 2024 . As its detectors are not degrading as fast as initially expected , the mission could therefore be extended . The Gaia targets objects brighter than magnitude 20 in a broad photometric band that covers most of the visual range ; such objects represent approximately 1% of the Milky Way population . Additionally , Gaia is expected to detect thousands to tens of thousands of Jupiter-sized exoplanets beyond the Solar System , 500,000 quasars outside our galaxy and tens of thousands of new asteroids and comets within the Solar System . The Gaia mission will create a precise three-dimensional map of astronomical objects throughout the Milky Way and map their motions , which encode the origin and subsequent evolution of the Milky Way . The spectrophotometric measurements will provide the detailed physical properties of all stars observed , characterizing their luminosity , effective temperature , gravity and elemental composition . This massive stellar census will provide the basic observational data to analyze a wide range of important questions related to the origin , structure , and evolutionary history of our galaxy .

  "/wiki/X-ray": "X-rays make up X-radiation , a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation .

X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays . In many languages , X-radiation is referred to as R\u00f6ntgen radiation , after the German scientist Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen , who discovered it on November 8 , 1895 . He named it X-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation . Spellings of X-ray ( s ) in English include the variants x-ray ( s ) , xray ( s ) , and X ray ( s ) .",
  "/wiki/Gamma_ray": "A gamma ray , or gamma radiation ( symbol \u03b3 or \u03b3 { \\displaystyle \\gamma } ) , is a penetrating electromagnetic radiation arising from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei . It consists of the shortest wavelength electromagnetic waves and so imparts the highest photon energy . Paul Villard , a French chemist and physicist , discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying radiation emitted by radium . In 1903 , Ernest Rutherford named this radiation gamma rays based on their relatively strong penetration of matter ; in 1900 he had already named two less penetrating types of decay radiation ( discovered by Henri Becquerel ) alpha rays and beta rays in ascending order of penetrating power . Gamma rays from radioactive decay are in the energy range from a few kiloelectronvolts ( keV ) to approximately 8 megaelectronvolts ( ~8 MeV ) , corresponding to the typical energy levels in nuclei with reasonably long lifetimes . The energy spectrum of gamma rays can be used to identify the decaying radionuclides using gamma spectroscopy . Very-high-energy gamma rays in the 100-1000 teraelectronvolt ( TeV ) range have been observed from sources such as the Cygnus X-3 microquasar . Natural sources of gamma rays originating on Earth are mostly as a result of radioactive decay and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles . However , there are other rare natural sources , such as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes , which produce gamma rays from electron action upon the nucleus . Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include fission , such as that which occurs in nuclear reactors , and high energy physics experiments , such as neutral pion decay and nuclear fusion . Gamma rays and X-rays are both electromagnetic radiation , and since they overlap in the electromagnetic spectrum , the terminology varies between scientific disciplines . In some fields of physics , they are distinguished by their origin : Gamma rays are created by nuclear decay , while in the case of X-rays , the origin is outside the nucleus ."
