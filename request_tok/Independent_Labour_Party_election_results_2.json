He joined the Amalgamated Stevedores ' Labour Protection League in 1879 , and in 1885 , he was elected as the union 's secretary . The post paid only GB\u00a30.17 ( equivalent to \u00a318.5 in 2019 ) a week , so he continued to work on the docks for his primary income . The Stevedores ' Union was a conservative organisation , taking little interest in current events , and focusing on restricting the admission of new members such that the total number of stevedores did not increase . McCarthy believed that its members would be in a stronger position if all workers at the docks were unionised , and he strongly supported Ben Tillett 's efforts in forming the Tea Operatives ' and General Labourers ' Association . Discontent over bonus payments in the docks arose in August 1889 , and McCarthy gave a speech on 12 August alongside Will Thorne , urging workers at the South Dock , Rotherhithe , to form a union and go on strike . This occurred , and although initially Tillett 's union was concerned that they had been bypassed , they soon joined , and with some difficulty , McCarthy also persuaded his union , and the rival United Society of Stevedores , to join the strike . It had now become the major London dock strike of 1889 , which succeeded in obtaining increased wages for dock workers , and inspired a wave of new trade unions across the country . Immediately after the strike , McCarthy was removed from his post by the executive of the Stevedores . Instead , he took up a full-time post as an organiser for Tillett 's union , now renamed as the Dock , Wharf , Riverside and General Labourers ' Union ."
