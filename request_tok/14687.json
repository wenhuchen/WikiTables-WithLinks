  "/wiki/Information_technology": "Information technology ( IT ) is the use of computers to store , retrieve , transmit , and manipulate data or information . IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies . IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology ( ICT ) . An information technology system ( IT system ) is generally an information system , a communications system or , more specifically speaking , a computer system - including all hardware , software and peripheral equipment - operated by a limited group of users . Humans have been storing , retrieving , manipulating , and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC , but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review ; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single established name . We shall call it information technology ( IT ) . Their definition consists of three categories : techniques for processing , the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making , and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs . The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks , but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones . Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology , including computer hardware , software , electronics , semiconductors , internet , telecom equipment , and e-commerce . [ a ] Based on the storage and processing technologies employed , it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development : pre-mechanical ( 3000 BC - 1450 AD ) , mechanical ( 1450-1840 ) , electromechanical ( 1840-1940 ) , and electronic ( 1940-present ) . This article focuses on the most recent period ( electronic ) .",

  "/wiki/Animation": "Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images . In traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . Today , most animations are made with computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings . Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets or clay figures . Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other . The illusion - as in motion pictures in general - is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement , but the exact causes are still uncertain . Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the ph\u00e9nakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope and film . Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally . For display on the computer , techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . Animation is more pervasive than many people realize . Apart from short films , feature films , animated GIF 's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images , animation is also prevalent in video games , motion graphics , user interfaces and visual effects .",

There are academic degrees specializing in agribusiness , departments of agribusiness , agribusiness trade associations , and agribusiness publications . In the context of agribusiness management in academia , each individual element of agriculture production and distribution may be described as agribusinesses . However , the term agribusiness most often emphasizes the interdependence of these various sectors within the production chain . Among critics of large-scale , industrialized , vertically integrated food production , the term agribusiness is used negatively , synonymous with corporate farming . As such , it is often contrasted with smaller family-owned farms .",
