  "/wiki/Audley_End_House": "Audley End House ( grid reference TL524381 ) is a largely early 17th-century country house outside Saffron Walden , Essex , England . It was once a prodigy house , a palace in all but name and renowned as one of the finest Jacobean houses in England . Audley End is now one-third of its original size , but is still large , with much to enjoy in its architectural features and varied collections . The house shares some similarities with Hatfield House , except that it is stone-clad as opposed to brick . It is currently in the stewardship of English Heritage and long remained the family seat of the Barons Braybrooke . Audley End railway station is named after the house .",
  "/wiki/English_country_house": "An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside . Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house . This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city - hence , for these people , the term distinguished between town and country . However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive . While a ch\u00e2teau or a Schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building , a country house , similar to an Ansitz , is usually unfortified . If fortified , it is called a castle , but not all buildings with the name castle are fortified ( for example Highclere Castle ) .",
  "/wiki/Hadleigh_Castle": "Hadleigh Castle is a ruined fortification in the English county of Essex , overlooking the Thames Estuary from south of the town of Hadleigh . Built after 1215 during the reign of Henry III by Hubert de Burgh , the castle was surrounded by parkland and had an important economic and defensive role . The castle was significantly expanded and remodelled by Edward III , who turned it into a grander property , designed to defend against a potential French attack , as well as to provide the King with a convenient private residence close to London . Built on a soft hill of London clay , the castle has often been subject to subsidence ; this , combined with the sale of its stonework in the 16th century , has led to it now being ruined . The remains are now preserved by English Heritage and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument .",
  "/wiki/Castle": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders . Scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . This is distinct from a palace , which is not fortified ; from a fortress , which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility ; and from a fortified settlement , which was a public defence - though there are many similarities among these types of construction . Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses . Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built , they took on a great many forms with many different features , although some , such as curtain walls , arrowslits , and portcullises , were commonplace . European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries , after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes . These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures ; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies . Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies , the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power . Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes , and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community , such as mills , fertile land , or a water source . Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber , but had their defences replaced later by stone . Early castles often exploited natural defences , lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep . In the late 12th and early 13th centuries , a scientific approach to castle defence emerged .",
  "/wiki/Defensive_wall": "A defensive wall is a fortification usually used to protect a city , town or other settlement from potential aggressors . The walls can be simple palisades or earthworks to extensive military fortifications with towers , bastions and gates to access to the city . In ancient to modern times , they were used to enclose settlements . Generally , these are referred to as city walls or town walls , although there were also walls , such as the Great Wall of China , Walls of Benin , Hadrian 's Wall , Anastasian Wall , the Cyclopean Wall Rajgir and the metaphorical Atlantic Wall , which extended far beyond the borders of a city and were used to enclose regions or mark territorial boundaries . In mountainous terrain , defensive walls such as letzis were used in combination with castles to seal valleys from potential attack . Beyond their defensive utility , many walls also had important symbolic functions - representing the status and independence of the communities they embraced . Existing ancient walls are almost always masonry structures , although brick and timber-built variants are also known . Depending on the topography of the area surrounding the city or the settlement the wall is intended to protect , elements of the terrain such as rivers or coastlines may be incorporated in order to make the wall more effective . Walls may only be crossed by entering the appropriate city gate and are often supplemented with towers . The practice of building these massive walls , though having its origins in prehistory , was refined during the rise of city-states , and energetic wall-building continued into the medieval period and beyond in certain parts of Europe . Simpler defensive walls of earth or stone , thrown up around hillforts , ringworks , early castles and the like , tend to be referred to as ramparts or banks .",
  "/wiki/Mistley_Towers": "Mistley Towers are the twin towers of the now demolished Church of St. Mary the Virgin at Mistley in Essex . The original Georgian parish church on the site had been built in classical style early in the 18th century following the death of Richard Rigby Esquire . Later in that century there was a grandiose plan by his son , the wealthy politician Richard Rigby , to transform Mistley Thorn into a spa town . Rigby wished to see a church from the windows of his mansion and a suitably grand church was required for the affluent visitors expected to patronise the new spa . Thus in 1776 , the renowned architect Robert Adam was commissioned to enhance the church . His design was in the neoclassical style , with a tower at both the east and the west ends of the church . These are now all that remain of the once magnificent structure .",
  "/wiki/Bell_tower": "A bell tower is a tower that contains one or more bells , or that is designed to hold bells even if it has none . Such a tower commonly serves as part of a church , and will contain church bells , but there are also many secular bell towers , often part of a municipal building , an educational establishment , or a tower built specifically to house a carillon . Church bell towers often incorporate clocks , and secular towers usually do , as a public service . The term campanile ( /\u02cck\u00e6mp\u0259\u02c8ni\u02d0li , -le\u026a/ , also US : /\u02cck\u0251\u02d0m-/ , Italian : [ kampa\u02c8ni\u02d0le ] ) , deriving from the Italian campanile , which in turn derives from campana , meaning bell , is synonymous with bell tower ; though in English usage campanile tends to be used to refer to a free standing bell tower . A bell tower may also in some traditions be called a belfry , though this term may also refer specifically to the substructure that houses the bells and the ringers rather than the complete tower . The tallest free-standing bell tower in the world , 113.2 metres ( 371 ft ) high , is the Mortegliano Bell Tower , in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region , Italy .",
  "/wiki/Barn": "A barn is an agricultural building usually on farms and used for various purposes . In the North American area , a barn refers to structures that house livestock , including cattle and horses , as well as equipment and fodder , and often grain . As a result , the term barn is often qualified e.g . tobacco barn , dairy barn , sheep barn , potato barn . In the British Isles , the term barn is restricted mainly to storage structures for unthreshed cereals and fodder , the terms byre or shippon being applied to cow shelters , whereas horses are kept in buildings known as stables . In mainland Europe , however , barns were often part of integrated structures known as byre-dwellings ( or housebarns in US literature ) . In addition , barns may be used for equipment storage , as a covered workplace , and for activities such as threshing .",
  "/wiki/St._Botolph's_Priory": "St. Botolph 's Priory was a Medieval Augustinian religious house in Colchester , Essex and had the distinction of being the first and leading Augustinian convent in England until its dissolution in 1536 .",
  "/wiki/Priory": "A priory is a monastery of men or women under religious vows that is headed by a prior or prioress . Priories may be houses of mendicant friars or nuns ( such as the Dominicans , Augustinians , Franciscans , and Carmelites , for instance ) , or monasteries of monks or nuns ( as with the Benedictines ) . Houses of canons regular and canonesses regular also use this term , the alternative being canonry . In pre-Reformation England , if an abbey church was raised to cathedral status , the abbey became a Cathedral Priory . The bishop , in effect , took the place of the abbot , and the monastery itself was headed by a prior .",

  "/wiki/Gatehouse": "A gatehouse is an entry control point building , enclosing or accompanying a gateway for a town , religious house , castle , manor house , or other fortification building of importance . Gatehouses are typically the most heavily armed section of a fortification , to compensate for being structurally the weakest and the most probable attack point by an enemy . There are numerous surviving examples in France , Austria , Germany , England and Japan .",
  "/wiki/Tilbury_Fort": "Tilbury Fort , also known historically as the Thermitage Bulwark and the West Tilbury Blockhouse , is an artillery fort on the north bank of the River Thames in England . The earliest version of the fort , comprising a small blockhouse with artillery covering the river , was constructed by King Henry VIII to protect London against attack from France as part of his Device programme . It was reinforced during the 1588 Spanish Armada invasion scare , after which it was reinforced with earthwork bastion , and Parliamentary forces used it to help secure the capital during the English Civil War of the 1640s . Following naval raids during the Anglo-Dutch Wars , the fort was enlarged by Sir Bernard de Gomme from 1670 onwards to form a star-shaped defensive work , with angular bastions , water-filled moats and two lines of guns facing onto the river . In addition to protecting the Thames , in the 18th century Tilbury also began to be used a transit depot and for storing gunpowder . It continued to be essential for the defence of the capital and a new artillery battery was added in the south-east corner during the Napoleonic Wars . The fort became increasingly less significant as a defensive structure , however , as military technology developed in the 19th century . It was redeveloped to hold heavy artillery after 1868 , providing a second-line of defence along the river , but further changes in technology meant that it had become obsolete by the end of the century . Instead Tilbury became a strategic depot , forming a logistical hub for storing and moving troops and materiel throughout the First World War . The fort had only a limited role in the Second World War and was demobilised in 1950 . Tilbury Fort is now operated by the heritage agency English Heritage as a tourist attraction , receiving 16,154 visitors in 2014 . Many of the more modern military features were demolished during the 1950s , with further restoration work taking place during the 1970s ahead of the site opening to the public in 1983 .",
  "/wiki/Device_Forts": "The Device Forts , also known as Henrician castles and blockhouses , were a series of artillery fortifications built to defend the coast of England and Wales by Henry VIII . [ a ] Traditionally , the Crown had left coastal defences in the hands of local lords and communities but the threat of French and Spanish invasion led the King to issue an order , called a device , for a major programme of work between 1539 and 1547 . The fortifications ranged from large stone castles positioned to protect the Downs anchorage in Kent , to small blockhouses overlooking the entrance to Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire , and earthwork bulwarks along the Essex coast . Some forts operated independently , others were designed to be mutually reinforcing . The Device programme was hugely expensive , costing a total of \u00a3376,000 ( estimated as between \u00a32 and \u00a382 million in today 's money ) ; [ b ] much of this was raised from the proceeds of the Dissolution of the Monasteries a few years before . These utilitarian fortifications were armed with artillery , intended to be used against enemy ships before they could land forces or attack ships lying in harbour . The first wave of work between 1539 and 1543 was characterised by the use of circular bastions and multi-tiered defences , combined with many traditional medieval features . These designs contained serious military flaws , however , and the second period of construction until 1547 saw the introduction of angular bastions and other innovations probably inspired by contemporary thinking in mainland Europe . The castles were commanded by captains appointed by the Crown , overseeing small garrisons of professional gunners and soldiers , who would be supplemented by the local militia in an emergency . Despite a French raid against the Isle of Wight in 1545 , the Device Forts saw almost no action before peace was declared in 1546 . Some of the defences were left to deteriorate and were decommissioned only a few years after their construction . After war broke out with Spain in 1569 , Elizabeth I improved many of the remaining fortifications , including during the attack of the Spanish Armada of 1588 .",
  "/wiki/Waltham_Abbey_Church": "The Abbey Church of Waltham Holy Cross and St Lawrence is the parish church of the town of Waltham Abbey , Essex , England . It has been a place of worship since the 7th century . The present building dates mainly from the early 12th century and is an example of Norman architecture . To the east of the existing church are traces of an enormous eastward enlargement of the building , begun following the re-foundation of the abbey in 1177 . In the Late Middle Ages , Waltham was one of the largest church buildings in England and a major site of pilgrimage ; in 1540 it was the last religious community to be closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries . It is still an active parish church for the town . The monastic buildings and those parts of the church east of the crossing were demolished at the Dissolution , and the Norman crossing tower and transepts collapsed in 1553 . The present-day church consists of the nave of the Norman abbey church , the 14th-century lady chapel and west wall , and a 16th-century west tower , added after the dissolution . King Harold Godwinson , who died at the Battle of Hastings , is said to be buried in the present churchyard .",
  "/wiki/Arch_bridge": "An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch . Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side . A viaduct ( a long bridge ) may be made from a series of arches , although other more economical structures are typically used today ."
