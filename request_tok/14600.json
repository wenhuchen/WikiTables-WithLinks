  "/wiki/NY_414": "New York State Route 414 ( NY 414 ) is a north-south state highway in the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions of New York in the United States . It extends for 83.20 miles ( 133.90 km ) from an intersection with NY 352 in the Steuben County city of Corning to a junction with NY 104 in the Wayne County town of Huron . NY 414 spans five counties and roughly parallels NY 14 between Watkins Glen and Huron . It intersects every major east-west arterial in western New York , including the Southern Tier Expressway ( Interstate 86 ( I-86 ) and NY 17 ) , U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) and NY 5 , and the New York State Thruway ( I-90 ) . The route passes through mostly rural areas as it travels between the several villages and cities along its routing . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the portion of modern NY 414 south of Seneca Falls was designated as part of New York State Route 44 , a route extending from Caton to Wolcott , while most of what is now NY 414 north of Seneca Falls became part of NY 89 . NY 44 was renumbered to NY 414 c. 1935 to eliminate numerical duplication with US 44 . NY 414 was shifted onto its current alignment between Seneca Falls and Huron on April 30 , 1959 , placing it on what had been NY 89 north of the hamlet of Magee and New York State Route 89A between Magee and the overlapped routes of US 20 and NY 5 .",
