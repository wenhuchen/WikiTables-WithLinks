  "/wiki/Sodium": "Sodium is a chemical element with the symbol Na ( from Latin natrium ) and atomic number 11 . It is a soft , silvery-white , highly reactive metal . Sodium is an alkali metal , being in group 1 of the periodic table , because it has a single electron in its outer shell , which it readily donates , creating a positively charged ion - the Na+ cation . Its only stable isotope is 23Na . The free metal does not occur in nature , and must be prepared from compounds . Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth 's crust and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars , sodalite , and rock salt ( NaCl ) . Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble : sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth 's minerals over eons , and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans . Sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide . Among many other useful sodium compounds , sodium hydroxide ( lye ) is used in soap manufacture , and sodium chloride ( edible salt ) is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans . Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants . Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid ( ECF ) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume . Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration , a condition called hypernatremia .",
  "/wiki/Carbonate": "In chemistry , a carbonate is a salt of carbonic acid ( H2CO3 ) , characterized by the presence of the carbonate ion , a polyatomic ion with the formula of CO2\u22123 . The name may also refer to a carbonate ester , an organic compound containing the carbonate group C ( =O ) ( O- ) 2 . The term is also used as a verb , to describe carbonation : the process of raising the concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate ions in water to produce carbonated water and other carbonated beverages - either by the addition of carbon dioxide gas under pressure , or by dissolving carbonate or bicarbonate salts into the water . In geology and mineralogy , the term carbonate can refer both to carbonate minerals and carbonate rock ( which is made of chiefly carbonate minerals ) , and both are dominated by the carbonate ion , CO2\u22123 . Carbonate minerals are extremely varied and ubiquitous in chemically precipitated sedimentary rock . The most common are calcite or calcium carbonate , CaCO3 , the chief constituent of limestone ( as well as the main component of mollusc shells and coral skeletons ) ; dolomite , a calcium-magnesium carbonate CaMg ( CO3 ) 2 ; and siderite , or iron ( II ) carbonate , FeCO3 , an important iron ore . Sodium carbonate ( soda or natron ) and potassium carbonate ( potash ) have been used since antiquity for cleaning and preservation , as well as for the manufacture of glass . Carbonates are widely used in industry , e.g . in iron smelting , as a raw material for Portland cement and lime manufacture , in the composition of ceramic glazes , and more .",

Historically it was extracted from the ashes of plants growing in sodium-rich soils . Because the ashes of these sodium-rich plants were noticeably different from ashes of wood ( once used to produce potash ) , sodium carbonate became known as soda ash . It is produced in large quantities from sodium chloride and limestone by the Solvay process .",

  "/wiki/Raising_agent": "A leaven /\u02c8l\u025bv\u0259n/ , often called a leavening agent /\u02c8l\u025bv\u0259n\u026a\u014b/ ( and also known as a raising agent ) , is any one of a number of substances used in doughs and batters that cause a foaming action ( gas bubbles ) that lightens and softens the mixture . An alternative or supplement to leavening agents is mechanical action by which air is incorporated . Leavening agents can be biological or synthetic chemical compounds . The gas produced is often carbon dioxide , or occasionally hydrogen . When a dough or batter is mixed , the starch in the flour and the water in the dough form a matrix ( often supported further by proteins like gluten or polysaccharides , such as pentosans or xanthan gum ) . Then the starch gelatinizes and sets , leaving gas bubbles that remain .",
  "/wiki/Potassium": "Potassium is a chemical element with the symbol K ( from Neo-Latin kalium ) and atomic number 19 . Potassium is a silvery-white metal that is soft enough to be cut with a knife with little force . Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure . It was first isolated from potash , the ashes of plants , from which its name derives . In the periodic table , potassium is one of the alkali metals , all of which have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell , that is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge - a cation , that combines with anions to form salts . Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts . Elemental potassium reacts vigorously with water , generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction , and burning with a lilac-colored flame . It is found dissolved in sea water ( which is 0.04% potassium by weight ) , and occurs in many minerals such as orthoclase , a common constituent of granites and other igneous rocks . Potassium is chemically very similar to sodium , the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table . They have a similar first ionization energy , which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron . It was suspected in 1702 that they were distinct elements that combine with the same anions to make similar salts , and was proven in 1807 using electrolysis . Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes , of which 40K is radioactive .",

It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column ( group 2 , or alkaline earth metals ) of the periodic table : all group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure . Magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe . It is produced in large , aging stars from the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus . When such stars explode as supernovas , much of the magnesium is expelled into the interstellar medium where it may recycle into new star systems . Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth 's crust and the fourth most common element in the Earth ( after iron , oxygen and silicon ) , making up 13% of the planet 's mass and a large fraction of the planet 's mantle . It is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater , after sodium and chlorine . Magnesium occurs naturally only in combination with other elements , where it invariably has a +2 oxidation state . The free element ( metal ) can be produced artificially , and is highly reactive ( though in the atmosphere , it is soon coated in a thin layer of oxide that partly inhibits reactivity - see passivation ) . The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant-white light . The metal is now obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine , and is used primarily as a component in aluminium-magnesium alloys , sometimes called magnalium or magnelium . Magnesium is less dense than aluminium , and the alloy is prized for its combination of lightness and strength .",

  "/wiki/Anti-caking_agent": "An anticaking agent is an additive placed in powdered or granulated materials , such as table salt or confectioneries , to prevent the formation of lumps ( caking ) and for easing packaging , transport , flowability , and consumption . Caking mechanisms depend on the nature of the material . Crystalline solids often cake by formation of liquid bridge and subsequent fusion of microcrystals . Amorphous materials can cake by glass transitions and changes in viscosity . Polymorphic phase transitions can also induce caking . Some anticaking agents function by absorbing excess moisture or by coating particles and making them water-repellent . Calcium silicate ( CaSiO3 ) , a commonly used anti-caking agent , added to e.g . table salt , absorbs both water and oil . Anticaking agents are also used in non-food items such as road salt , fertilisers , cosmetics , synthetic detergents , and in manufacturing applications . Some studies suggest that anticaking agents may have a negative effect on the nutritional content of food ; one such study indicated that most anti-caking agents result in the additional degradation of vitamin C added to food .",

It is a valuable iron mineral , since it is 48% iron and contains no sulfur or phosphorus . Zinc , magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron resulting in the siderite-smithsonite , siderite-magnesite and siderite-rhodochrosite solid solution series . Siderite has Mohs hardness of 3.75-4.25 , a specific gravity of 3.96 , a white streak and a vitreous lustre or pearly luster . Siderite is antiferromagnetic below its N\u00e9el temperature of 37 K which can assist in its identification . It crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system , and are rhombohedral in shape , typically with curved and striated faces . It also occurs in masses . Color ranges from yellow to dark brown or black , the latter being due to the presence of manganese . Siderite is commonly found in hydrothermal veins , and is associated with barite , fluorite , galena , and others . It is also a common diagenetic mineral in shales and sandstones , where it sometimes forms concretions , which can encase three-dimensionally preserved fossils .

  "/wiki/Acid": "An Acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a proton ( hydrogen ion H+ ) ( a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) . The first category of acids are the proton donors , or Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Br\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Br\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ . Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/ac\u0113re meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic . Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) .",

  "/wiki/Preservative": "A preservative is a substance or a chemical that is added to products such as food products , beverages , pharmaceutical drugs , paints , biological samples , cosmetics , wood , and many other products to prevent decomposition by microbial growth or by undesirable chemical changes . In general , preservation is implemented in two modes , chemical and physical . Chemical preservation entails adding chemical compounds to the product . Physical preservation entails processes such as refrigeration or drying . Preservative food additives reduce the risk of foodborne infections , decrease microbial spoilage , and preserve fresh attributes and nutritional quality . Some physical techniques for food preservation include dehydration , UV-C radiation , freeze-drying , and refrigeration . Chemical preservation and physical preservation techniques are sometimes combined .",
