  "section_text": "This tournament had two teams less compared to the previous edition due to the absence of English county teams because the tournament dates clashed with the end of England 's domestic season . [ 10 ] The England national team also had a One Day International series with Pakistan during the tournament period . The format of the tournament was modified to accommodate this . Apart from England , Pakistan is the only other top-eight Test-playing nation not to be represented in the tournament . In February 2010 , Ijaz Butt , the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board , had reportedly refused participation in the tournament due to the snubbing of Pakistani cricketers in the 2010 Indian Premier League player auction . The auction resulted in none of them being bought for the league . [ 11 ] Butt later stated his comments were misunderstood , but the Champions League administrators had already decided to leave out Pakistan due to Butt 's statements . Champions League officials have made contradicting statements as to whether a Pakistan team would have been considered regardless of Butt 's statement . Pakistan was also absent from the previous edition due to the deterioration of relations between host nation India and Pakistan .
