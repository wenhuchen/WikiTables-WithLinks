  "/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_(Formula_One)": "Italian motor manufacturer Alfa Romeo has participated many times in Formula One . It currently participates as Alfa Romeo Racing Orlen while being operated by Sauber Motorsport AG . The brand has competed in motor racing as both a constructor and engine supplier sporadically between 1950 and 1987 , and later as a commercial partner since 2015 . The company 's works drivers won the first two World Drivers ' Championships in the pre-war Alfetta : Nino Farina in 1950 ; and Juan Manuel Fangio in 1951 . Following these successes Alfa Romeo withdrew from Formula One . During the 1960s , although the company had no official presence in the top tier of motorsport a number of Formula One teams used independently developed Alfa Romeo engines to power their cars . In the early 1970s , Alfa provided Formula One support for their works driver Andrea de Adamich , supplying adapted versions of their 3-litre V8 engine from the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33/3 sports car to power Adamich 's McLaren ( 1970 ) and March ( 1971 ) entries . None of these engine combinations scored championship points . In the mid-1970s , Alfa engineer Carlo Chiti designed a flat-12 engine to replace the T33 V8 , which achieved some success in taking the 1975 World Sportscar Championship . Bernie Ecclestone , then owner of the Brabham Formula One team , persuaded Alfa Romeo to supply this engine free for the 1976 Formula One season . Although the Brabham-Alfa Romeo 's first season was relatively modest , during the 1977 and 1978 World Championships their cars took 14 podium finishes , including two race victories for Niki Lauda .
