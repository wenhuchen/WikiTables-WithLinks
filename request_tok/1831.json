It existed from the 8th century up to c. 969-971 and was ruled by the Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty . Its first ruler known by name was Vi\u0161eslav who started ruling around 780 . In 822 , the Serbs were said to rule the greater part of Dalmatia , while by that time , starting from the year 681 , the Bulgarian state had taken the lands to the east , preparing to conquer Serbia . Vlastimir defeated the Bulgarian army in a three-year-war ( 839-842 ) , and the two powers lived in peace for some decades . Vlastimir 's three sons succeeded in ruling Serbia together , although not for long ; Serbia became a key part in the power struggle between the Byzantines and Bulgarians ( in predominantly Byzantine alliance ) , which also resulted in major dynastic wars for a period of three decades . Central parts of the principality were shortly occupied by the Bulgarian army for three years ( 924-927 ) , until Serbian prince \u010caslav succeeded to liberate the land and unite several Serbian regions , becoming the most powerful ruler of the Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty . An important process during this period was the Christianization of the Serbs , the establishment of Christianity as state-religion c. 869 , and the founding of the first Serbian eparchy ( diocese ) , the Eparchy of Ras . The principality was annexed by the Byzantines in c. 969-971 and ruled as the Catepanate of Ras . The main information of the history of the principality and Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty are recorded in the contemporary historical work De Administrando Imperio ( written c. 950-960 ) .",

First mentioned in 10th- and 11th century Byzantine chronicles , it was a vassal of the Byzantine Empire until it became independent in 1040 under Stefan Vojislav ( fl . 1034-43 ) who rose up and managed to take over territories of the earlier Serbian Principality , founding the Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty . Between 1043 and 1080 , under Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107 ( r. 1050-81 ) , and his son , Constantine Bodin ( r. 1081-1101 ) , Duklja saw its apogee . Mihailo was given the nominal title King of Slavs by the Pope after having left the Byzantine camp and supported an uprising in the Balkans , in which his son Bodin played a central part . Having incorporated the Serbian hinterland ( the core of the earlier Serbian Principality , known as Ra\u0161ka ) and installed vassal rulers there , this maritime principality emerged as the most powerful Serb polity , seen in the titles used by its rulers ( Prince of Serbia , of Serbs ) . However , its rise was short-lived , as Bodin was defeated by the Byzantines and imprisoned ; pushed to the background , his relative and vassal Vukan became independent in Ra\u0161ka , which continued the fight against the Byzantines while Duklja was struck with civil wars . Between 1113 and 1149 Duklja was the centre of Serbian-Byzantine conflict , with members of the Vojislavljevi\u0107 as prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of either fighting each other for power . Duklja was then incorporated as a crown land of the Grand Principality of Serbia ruled by the Vukanovi\u0107 dynasty , subsequently known as Zeta , remaining so until the fall of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bosnia": "The Kingdom of Bosnia ( Bosnian : Kraljevina Bosna / \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0430 ) , or Bosnian Kingdom ( Bosansko kraljevstvo / \u0411\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) , was a South Slavic medieval kingdom that lasted from 1377 to 1463 and evolved out of the Banate of Bosnia ( 1154-1377 ) . Although Hungarian kings viewed Bosnia as under their sovereignty during this time , Bosnian rulers mostly acted independently in conducting diplomacy , governing the judicial system , granting towns and estates , minting coins , exploiting natural resources , and making trading agreements with other countries and independent cities . King Tvrtko I ( r. 1353-91 ) acquired portions of western Serbia and most of the Adriatic coast south of the Neretva River . During the late part of his reign , Bosnia briefly became one of the strongest states in the Balkan Peninsula . However , feudal fragmentation remained strong in Bosnia , and after his death the country lost its importance . The Bosnian nobility had significant power , holding meetings at a venue known as Stanak where members deliberated on matters such as election of the new king or queen and coronations , foreign policy , sale or cession of territory , contracting and signing treaties with neighbouring countries , and military issues . The Ottoman Empire annexed portions of eastern Bosnia in the 1440s and 1450s and went on to conquer Herzegovina , with the last fortress falling in 1481 . Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 , the last king of Bosnia , was captured by the Ottomans and killed in 1463 . The population of Bosnia at its height was between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people . The overwhelming majority of the population was rural , with few significant urban centres . Among the more notable towns were Doboj , Jajce , Srebrenik , Srebrenica , Te\u0161anj , and Podvisoki . Mining , especially for silver , was a major source of income for Bosnian kings ."
