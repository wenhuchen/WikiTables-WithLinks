  "/wiki/Panama_City": "Panama City ( Spanish : Ciudad de Panam\u00e1 ; pronounced [ sju\u02c8\u00f0a ( \u00f0 ) \u00f0e pana\u02c8ma ] ) , also simply known as Panama , is the capital and largest city of Panama . It has an urban population of 880,691 , with over 1.5 million in its metropolitan area . The city is located at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal , in the province of Panama . The city is the political and administrative center of the country , as well as a hub for banking and commerce . The city of Panama was founded on August 15 , 1519 , by Spanish conquistador Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila . The city was the starting point for expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru . It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the American continent , leading to the fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo , through which passed most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas . On January 28 , 1671 , the original city was destroyed by a fire when privateer Henry Morgan sacked and set fire to it . The city was formally reestablished two years later on January 21 , 1673 , on a peninsula located 8 km ( 5 miles ) from the original settlement . The site of the previously devastated city is still in ruins , and is now a popular tourist attraction , and is regularly visited by school trips .",
  "/wiki/West_Indian": "A West Indian is a native or inhabitant of the West Indies ( the Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago ) . For more than 100 years the words West Indian specifically described natives of the West Indies , but by 1661 Europeans had begun to use it also to describe the descendants of European colonists who stayed in the West Indies . Some West Indian people reserve this term for citizens or natives of the British West Indies .",
  "/wiki/Panama_Canal": "The Panama Canal ( Spanish : Canal de Panam\u00e1 ) is an artificial 82 km ( 51 mi ) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean . The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade . Canal locks are at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake , an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal , 26 m ( 85 ft ) above sea level , and then lower the ships at the other end . The original locks are 32.5 m ( 110 ft ) wide . A third , wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016 . The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26 , 2016 . The new locks allow transit of larger , neo-Panamax ships , capable of handling more cargo . The construction of the Panama Canal is where the expression Another Day , Another Dollar comes from , as the workers were rumored to be paid a dollar a day for their labor . France began work on the canal in 1881 , but stopped due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate . The United States took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15 , 1914 . One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken , the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , enabling them to avoid the lengthy , hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan and the even less popular route through the Arctic Archipelago and the Bering Strait . Colombia , France , and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction .",
