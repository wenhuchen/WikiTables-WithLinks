  "section_text": "Traditionally , the Shailendra period was viewed to span from the 8th to the 9th century , confined only in Central Java , from the era of Panangkaran to Samaratungga . However the recent interpretation suggests the longer period of Shailendra family might existed , from mid 7th century ( edict of Sojomerto inscription ) to early 11th century ( the fall of Shailendran dynasty of Srivijaya under Chola invasion ) . For certain period , Shailendras ruled both Central Java and Sumatra . Their alliance and intermarriage with Srivijayan ruling family resulted with the merging of two royal houses , with Shailendran finally emerge as the ruling family of both Srivijaya and Medang Mataram ( Central Java ) .",
  "uid": "Sailendra_0",
  "intro": "The Shailendra dynasty (IAST: \u015aail\u0113ndra derived from Sanskrit combined words \u015aaila and Indra, meaning King of the Mountain, also spelled Sailendra, Syailendra or Selendra) was the name of a notable Indianised dynasty that emerged in 8th-century Java, whose reign signified a cultural renaissance in the region. The Shailendras were active promoters of Mahayana Buddhism with the glimpses of Hinduism, and covered the Kedu Plain of Central Java with Buddhist monuments, one of which is the colossal stupa of Borobudur, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Shailendras are considered to have been a thalassocracy and ruled vast swathes of maritime Southeast Asia, however they also relied on agricultural pursuits, by way of intensive rice cultivation on the Kedu Plain of Central Java. The dynasty appeared to be the ruling family of both the Medang Kingdom of Central Java, for some period, and the Srivijaya Kingdom in Sumatra. The inscriptions created by Shailendras use three languages; Old Malay, Old Javanese, and Sanskrit - written either in the Kawi alphabet, or pre-N\u0101gar\u012b script. The use of Old Malay has sparked speculation of a Sumatran origin, or Srivijayan connection of this family. On the other hand, the use of Old Javanese suggests their firm political establishment on Java. The use of Sanskrit usually indicates the official nature, and/or religious significance, of the event described in any given inscription."
