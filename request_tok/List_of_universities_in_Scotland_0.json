During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries , Aberdeen 's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content . Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s , Aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of Europe . The area around Aberdeen has been settled for at least 8,000 years , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don . The city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters . Aberdeen received Royal burgh status from David I of Scotland ( 1124-1153 ) , transforming the city economically . The city has two universities , the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 , and Robert Gordon University , which was awarded university status in 1992 , making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland . The traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen 's seaport .

Born into the prominent Borgia family in X\u00e0tiva in the Crown of Aragon , Rodrigo studied law at the University of Bologna . He was ordained deacon and made a cardinal in 1456 after the election of his uncle as Pope Callistus III , and a year later he became vice-chancellor of the Catholic Church . He proceeded to serve in the Curia under the next four popes , acquiring significant influence and wealth in the process . In 1492 , Rodrigo was elected Pope , taking the name Alexander VI . Alexander 's bulls of 1493 confirmed or reconfirmed the rights of the Spanish crown in the New World following the finds of Christopher Columbus in 1492 . During the second Italian war , Alexander VI supported his son Cesare Borgia as a condottiero for the French King . The scope of his foreign policy was to gain the most advantageous terms for his family . Alexander is considered one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes , partly because he acknowledged fathering several children by his mistresses . As a result , his Italianized Valencian surname , Borgia , became a byword for libertinism and nepotism , which are traditionally considered as characterizing his pontificate . On the other hand , two of Alexander 's successors , Sixtus V and Urban VIII , described him as one of the most outstanding popes since Saint Peter .",

The buildings of Marischal College continued to be used for academic purposes until the mid-20th century and less and less until the early 2000s . During this period they were frequently rebuilt and expanded upon . In the mid-to-late 20th century , teaching and academic activities at the university began to move to King 's College or Foresterhill ( for students of medicine ) and by the early 21st century a new purpose for Marischal College was required . After a number of unsuccessful proposals , the majority of the building was leased to Aberdeen City Council to be restored and refurbished as office accommodation .

  "/wiki/Stirling": "Stirling ( /\u02c8st\u025c\u02d0rl\u026a\u014b/ ; Scots : Stirlin ; Scottish Gaelic : Sruighlea [ \u02c8s\u032at\u032a\u027eu\u029dl\u0259 ] ) is a city in central Scotland , 26 miles ( 42 km ) north-east of Glasgow and 37 miles ( 60 km ) north-west of the Scottish capital , Edinburgh . The market town , surrounded by rich farmland , grew up connecting the royal citadel , the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen , the bridge and the port . Located on the River Forth , Stirling is the administrative centre for the Stirling council area , and is traditionally the county town of Stirlingshire . Proverbially it is the strategically important Gateway to the Highlands . It has been said that Stirling , like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together . Similarly he who holds Stirling , holds Scotland is often quoted . Stirling 's key position as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth made it a focal point for travel north or south . When Stirling was temporarily under Anglo-Saxon sway , according to a 9th-century legend , it was attacked by Danish invaders . The sound of a wolf roused a sentry , however , who alerted his garrison , which forced a Viking retreat . This led to the wolf being adopted as a symbol of the town as is shown on the 1511 Stirling Jug . The area is today known as Wolfcraig . Even today the wolf appears with a goshawk on the council 's coat of arms along with the recently chosen motto : Steadfast as the Rock .",
  "/wiki/Robbins_Report": "The Robbins Report ( the report of the Committee on Higher Education , chaired by Lord Robbins ) was commissioned by the British government and published in 1963 . The committee met from 1961 to 1963 . After the report 's publication , its conclusions were accepted by the government on 24 October 1963 . The report recommended immediate expansion of universities , and that all colleges of advanced technology should be given the status of universities . Consequently , the number of full-time university students was to rise from 197,000 in the 1967-68 academic year to 217,000 in the academic year of 1973-74 with further big expansion thereafter . The report also concluded that university places should be available to all who were qualified for them by ability and attainment ( the so-called Robbins principle ) and that such institutions should have four main objectives essential to any properly balanced system : instruction in skills ; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women ; to maintain research in balance with teaching , since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth ; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship . Chapter X recommended the establishment of the Council for National Academic Awards . Lord Robbins subsequently became the first chancellor of the University of Stirling in 1968 . The Senior Research Officer for the committee that drew up the report was economist Richard Layard .",

Before the middle of the 19th century the Highlands was home to a much larger population , but from circa 1841 and for the next 160 years , the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration ( mostly to Canada , the United States , Australia and New Zealand , and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England . ) : xxiii , 414 and passim The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe .

Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language , although in a few areas English speakers form a majority .

There are various important prehistoric structures , many of which pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors . The Western Isles became part of the Norse kingdom of the Su\u00f0reyjar , which lasted for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266 . Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs , principal of whom were the MacLeods , MacDonalds , Mackenzies and MacNeils .
