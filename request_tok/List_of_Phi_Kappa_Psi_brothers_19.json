  "/wiki/Cornell_University": "Cornell University ( /k\u0254\u02d0r\u02c8n\u025bl/ kor-NEL ) is a private and statutory Ivy League research university in Ithaca , New York . Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White , the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge - from the classics to the sciences , and from the theoretical to the applied . These ideals , unconventional for the time , are captured in Cornell 's founding principle , a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation : I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study . The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus , with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy . The university also administers two satellite medical campuses , one in New York City and one in Education City , Qatar , and Cornell Tech , a graduate program that incorporates technology , business , and creative thinking . The program moved from Google 's Chelsea Building in New York City to its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in September 2017 . Cornell is one of ten private land grant universities in the United States and the only one in New York . [ note 1 ] Of its seven undergraduate colleges , three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York ( SUNY ) system , including its agricultural and human ecology colleges as well as its industrial labor relations school . Of Cornell 's graduate schools , only the veterinary college is state-supported . As a land grant college , Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions . The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres , but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic Gardens ( more than 4,300 acres ) and the numerous university-owned lands in New York City are considered . As of October 2019 , 59 Nobel laureates , four Turing Award winners and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with Cornell University .",
  "/wiki/Astrophysics": "Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry to ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects , rather than their positions or motions in space . Among the objects studied are the Sun , other stars , galaxies , extrasolar planets , the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background . Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , and the properties examined include luminosity , density , temperature , and chemical composition . Because astrophysics is a very broad subject , astrophysicists apply concepts and methods from many disciplines of physics , including classical mechanics , electromagnetism , statistical mechanics , thermodynamics , quantum mechanics , relativity , nuclear and particle physics , and atomic and molecular physics . In practice , modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics . Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter , dark energy , black holes , and other celestial bodies ; whether or not time travel is possible , wormholes can form , or the multiverse exists ; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe . Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar System formation and evolution ; stellar dynamics and evolution ; galaxy formation and evolution ; magnetohydrodynamics ; large-scale structure of matter in the universe ; origin of cosmic rays ; general relativity , special relativity , quantum and physical cosmology , including string cosmology and astroparticle physics .",
  "/wiki/Pulsar": "A pulsar ( from pulse and -ar as in quasar ) is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles . This radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth ( much like the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer ) , and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission . Neutron stars are very dense , and have short , regular rotational periods . This produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar . Pulsars are one of the candidates for the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays ( see also centrifugal mechanism of acceleration ) . The periods of pulsars make them very useful tools for astronomers . Observations of a pulsar in a binary neutron star system were used to indirectly confirm the existence of gravitational radiation . The first extrasolar planets were discovered around a pulsar , PSR B1257+12 . Certain types of pulsars exceed atomic clocks in their accuracy in keeping time .",

The crusts of Earth , Moon , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Io , and other planetary bodies formed via igneous processes , and were later modified by erosion , impact cratering , volcanism , and sedimentation . Most terrestrial planets have fairly uniform crusts . Earth , however , has two distinct types : continental crust and oceanic crust .

  "/wiki/Malaria": "Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals . Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever , tiredness , vomiting , and headaches . In severe cases it can cause yellow skin , seizures , coma , or death . Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito . If not properly treated , people may have recurrences of the disease months later . In those who have recently survived an infection , reinfection usually causes milder symptoms . This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria . It is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group . The disease is most commonly spread by an infected female Anopheles mosquito . The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito 's saliva into a person 's blood .

  "/wiki/H._Houston_Merritt": "Hiram Houston Merritt Jr. ( January 12 , 1902 , Wilmington , North Carolina - January 9 , 1979 in Boston , Massachusetts ) was one of the pre-eminent academic neurologists of his day . As the chair of the Neurological Institute of New York from 1948 to 1967 , he oversaw the training of hundreds of neurologists ; 35 of his former students have become chairs of academic neurology departments across the United States . He was also the dean of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons from 1958 to 1970 . His contributions to neurology were countless . Among the most important was the discovery of the anticonvulsant properties of phenytoin ( Dilantin ) . The technique he used , along with Tracy Putnam , to identify this compound ushered in the modern era of drug therapy for epilepsy . He also was the sole author of the first five editions of Merritt 's Neurology ; this popular textbook is in its twelfth edition ( Rowland and Pedley , 2009 ) . His early work on the normal properties of the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) was updated and published by one of his students , Robert Fishman , in a text that is the acknowledged standard on the topic . Merritt was also known in his day as an expert on neurosyphilis ; his 1946 monograph on the topic provided an overview of this condition , which almost disappeared from the medical eye shortly thereafter owing to the advent of penicillin . Charles Poser , another eminent neurologist , worked under Merritt , and credited him teaching him the importance of a thorough diagnosis .",

The mission was flown June 3-6 , 1966 , after launch of the backup Augmented Target Docking Adaptor ( ATDA ) . Stafford and Cernan rendezvoused with the ATDA , but were unable to dock with it because the nose fairing failed to eject from the docking target due to a launch preparation error . Cernan performed a two-hour extravehicular activity , during which it was planned for him to demonstrate free flight in a self-contained rocket pack , the USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit . He was unable to accomplish this due to stress , fatigue , and overheating ."
