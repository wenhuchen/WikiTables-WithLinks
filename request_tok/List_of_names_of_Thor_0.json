This pantheon includes Odin , Frigg , Thor , Baldr and T\u00fdr . The second pantheon is known as the Vanir . In Norse mythology , the two pantheons wage war against each other , which results in a unified pantheon . The cognate term in Old English is \u014ds ( plural \u0113se ) denoting a deity in Anglo-Saxon paganism . The Old High German is ans , plural ens\u00ee . The Gothic language had ans- ( based only on Jordanes who glossed anses with uncertain meaning , possibly 'demi-god ' and presumably a Latinized form of actual plural *anseis ) . The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is *ansuz , the term \u014ds ( \u00e1ss ) was never adopted into Christian use .",

It is a listing in verse of names that may be used in poetry for various items , such as gods , giants , people , animals , and weapons . The verses are not in all manuscripts of the Edda and appear independently , and are probably a later addition to Snorri 's original composition ; they may have been one of its sources .

  "/wiki/Prose_Edda": "The Prose Edda , also known as the Younger Edda , Snorri 's Edda ( Icelandic : Snorra Edda ) or , historically , simply as Edda , is an Old Norse work of literature written in Iceland during the early 13th century . The work is often assumed to have been written , or at least compiled , by the Icelandic scholar , lawspeaker , and historian Snorri Sturluson c. 1220 . It is considered the fullest and most detailed source for modern knowledge of Germanic mythology . It begins with a euhemerized Prologue , a section on the Norse cosmogony , pantheon , and myths . This is followed by three distinct books : Gylfaginning ( consisting of approximately 20,000 words ) , Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l ( approximately 50,000 words ) , and H\u00e1ttatal ( approximately 20,000 words ) . Seven manuscripts , dating from c. 1300 to 1600 , have independent textual value . Sturluson planned the collection as a textbook . It was to enable Icelandic poets and readers to understand the subtleties of alliterative verse , and to grasp the meaning behind the many kenningar ( compounds ) that were used in skaldic poetry . The Prose Edda was originally referred to as simply Edda , but was later titled the Prose Edda in modern collections to distinguish it from the collections titled Poetic Edda that are largely based on Codex Regius , a collection of poetry composed after Edda in 13th century Iceland . At that time , versions of the Edda were well known in Iceland , but scholars speculated that there once was an Elder Edda which contained the poems which Snorri quotes in his Edda .",

The version in \u00derymlur is believed to be based on that of \u00derymskvi\u00f0a , but is in some respects more detailed and has some independent elements . The cycle consists of three r\u00edmur , each in a different verse form . The first is in ferskeytt , the second in braghent and the third in stafhent . The r\u00edmur are only preserved in one medieval manuscript , Sta\u00f0arh\u00f3lsb\u00f3k . The beginning of the first r\u00edma is lost . Sophus Bugge argued that the Scandinavian ballad Torsvisen was originally based on \u00derymlur , pointing out some parallels .

  "/wiki/Lokasenna": "Lokasenna ( Loki 's flyting , Loki 's wrangling , Loki 's quarrel ) is one of the poems of the Poetic Edda . The poem presents flyting between the gods and Loki . It is written in the lj\u00f3\u00f0ah\u00e1ttr metre , typical for wisdom verse . Loki , amongst other things , accuses the gods of moralistic sexual impropriety , the practice of sei\u00f0r ( sorcery ) , and bias . Not ostensibly the most serious of allegations , these elements are , however , said ultimately to lead to the onset of Ragnar\u00f6k in the Eddic poem V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 . However , Lokasenna does not directly state that Loki 's binding is as a consequence of the killing of Baldr . This is explicitly stated only in Snorri Sturluson 's Prose Edda . Lee M. Hollander , in his introduction to his translation of the poem , claims that it was in no sense a popular lay and suggests we should not necessarily believe that the accusations of the sly god were an accepted part of the lore .",
  "/wiki/Ukko": "Ukko , or \u00c4ij\u00e4 or \u00c4ij\u00f6 ( Finnish : male grandparent , grandfather , old man ) , parallel to Uku in Estonian mythology , is the god of the sky , weather , harvest and thunder in Finnish mythology . Ukkonen , the Finnish word for thunder is the diminutive form of the name Ukko . [ note 1 ] [ note 2 ] Some researchers believe that Ilmarinen , another Finnic sky god , is the origin of Ukko , while some others believe that Ukko 's original name was Baltic Perkele . Ukko is held the most significant god of Finnish mythology , although it is disputed by scholars whether this is accountable to later Christian influence . In the folk poems and prayers he is also given the epithet Ylijumala ( English : Supreme God ) , probably in reference to his status as the most highly regarded god and on the other hand his traditional domain in the heavens . Other names for Ukko include Pitk\u00e4nen ( pitk\u00e4 , long ) , Is\u00e4inen ( is\u00e4 , father ) , Isoinen ( iso , archaic form of the above , modern meaning great , big or large ) . Although portrayed active in myth , Ukko makes all his appearances in legend solely by natural phenomena when appealed to . According to Martti Haavio , the name Ukko was sometimes used as a common noun or generalised epithet for multiple deities instead of denoting a specific god .",
