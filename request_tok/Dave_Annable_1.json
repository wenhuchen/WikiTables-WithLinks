Its programming includes contemporary off-network syndicated reruns and original series , feature films , and made-for-TV original movies . Since the network was launched on April 29 , 1977 , it has undergone different changes to its programming format and naming under its four different owners . The network was founded as a religious channel , the CBN Satellite Service - an extension of televangelist Pat Robertson 's Christian Broadcasting Network . It evolved into a family-focused entertainment network in 1981 , and was spun off into a for-profit company known as International Family Entertainment ( IFE ) in 1990 , eventually becoming known as The Family Channel . As a condition of the spin-off , the channel was contractually required to maintain airings of The 700 Club and an annual telethon on the last Sunday in January ; these conditions have applied to all future owners of the channel . In 1997 , IFE and The Family Channel were acquired by a joint venture between News Corporation and Saban Entertainment , resulting in its re-branding as the Fox Family Channel a year later .
