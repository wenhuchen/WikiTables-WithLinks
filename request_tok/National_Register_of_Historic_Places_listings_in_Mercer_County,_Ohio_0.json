  "/wiki/Grand_Lake_St._Marys_Lighthouse": "The Grand Lake St. Marys Lighthouse , also known as the Northwoods Lighthouse , is a historic lighthouse on Grand Lake St. Marys , a reservoir in the far western part of the U.S. state of Ohio . Located east of the city of Celina in Mercer County , the lighthouse was built in 1923 , using a plan modeled after the Eddystone Lighthouse off the coast of Cornwall in the United Kingdom . A predominately concrete structure , the lighthouse rests on a stone foundation . Measuring 50 feet ( 15 m ) from foundation to pinnacle , it is covered with a dome of bronze and glass that surrounds the beacon ; the dome is crowned with a decorative weathervane . Although the lighthouse was built partially for ornamental purposes , it has also served as an active lighthouse . In its earliest years , it operated in a standard lighthouse role between April and November under a license from the U.S. Coast Guard . Grand Lake St. Marys was built to provide water for the Miami and Erie Canal ; although the canal had ceased operations by 1923 , there was still sufficient lake traffic to warrant the use of a lighthouse on this peninsula , which protrudes into the northern shore of the lake . Today , it is one of three lighthouses on Grand Lake St. Marys : the Celina Rotary Club erected an operating lighthouse in 1986 , at the lake 's northwestern corner , and a third lighthouse was completed on the lake 's southern shore in 2003 . Unlike the other two lighthouses , the Northwoods Lighthouse is completely inaccessible by land , as surrounding property owners have completely blocked public access . In 1982 , the Grand Lake St. Marys Lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its historically significant architecture . Key to its inclusion was its unusual location - western Ohio is a flat , landlocked region far from major bodies of water . It is the only historic lighthouse in the region , and until the construction of the Rotary Club lighthouse in 1986 , there were no other lighthouses in the region at all .",
