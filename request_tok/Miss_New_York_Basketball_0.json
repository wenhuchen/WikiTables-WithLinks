  "/wiki/Duke": "A duke ( male ) can either be a monarch ranked below the emperor , king , and grand duke ruling over a duchy or a member of royalty or nobility , historically of highest rank , below princes of nobility and grand dukes . The title comes from French duc , itself from the Latin dux , 'leader ' , a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank ( particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin ) , and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province . In most countries , the word duchess is the female equivalent . However , in some countries ( such as the UK ) , the term duke is used even for females , and the word duchess is reserved for those who marry dukes . The title dux survived in the Eastern Roman Empire where it was used in several contexts signifying a rank equivalent to a captain or general . Later on , in the 11th century , the title Megas Doux was introduced for the post of commander-in-chief of the entire navy . During the Middle Ages the title ( as Herzog ) signified first among the Germanic monarchies . Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later , in the feudal monarchies , the highest-ranking peers of the king . A duke may or may not be , ipso facto , a member of the nation 's peerage : in the United Kingdom and Spain all dukes are/were also peers of the realm , in France some were and some were not , while the term is not applicable to dukedoms of other nations , even where an institution similar to the peerage ( e.g. , Grandeeship , Imperial Diet , Hungarian House of Magnates ) existed . During the 19th century many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled by Dukes or Grand Dukes . But at present , with the exception of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , there are no dukes ruling as monarchs . Duke remains the highest hereditary title ( aside from titles borne by the reigning or formerly reigning dynasty ) in Portugal ( though now a republic ) , Spain , and the United Kingdom .",
