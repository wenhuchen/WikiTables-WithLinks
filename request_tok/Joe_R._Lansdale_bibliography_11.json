  "/wiki/Tonto": "Tonto is a fictional character ; he is the Native American ( either Comanche or Potawatomi ) companion of the Lone Ranger , a popular American Western character created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker . Tonto has appeared in radio and television series and other presentations of the characters ' adventures righting wrongs in 19th century western United States . In Italian , Portuguese , and Spanish , tonto translates as a dumb person , moron , or fool . In the Italian version the original name is retained , but in the Spanish dubbed version , the character is called Toro ( Spanish for bull ) or Ponto . Show creator Trendle grew up in Michigan , and knew members of the local Potawatomi tribe , who told him it meant wild one in their language . When he created the Lone Ranger , he gave the moniker to the Ranger 's sidekick , apparently unaware of the name 's negative connotations . Tonto made his first appearance on the 11th episode of the radio show , which originated on the Detroit , Michigan , radio station WXYZ . Though he became well known as the Lone Ranger 's friend , Tonto was originally created just so the Lone Ranger would have someone with whom to talk . Throughout the radio run ( which spanned 21 years ) , with only a few exceptions , Tonto was played by American actor John Todd . Chief Thundercloud played the character in the Republic movie serials The Lone Ranger and The Lone Ranger Rides Again . To this point , Tonto had been depicted , on the radio series , as a somewhat elderly sidekick . This serial established the better-remembered image of Tonto as a handsome young tribal warrior in buckskins .",

Panels are often accompanied by descriptive prose and written narrative , usually , dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form . Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan , comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s . The first modern comic book , Famous Funnies , was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips , which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics . The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone ; however , this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres , usually not humorous in tone . The largest comic book market is Japan . By 1995 , the manga market in Japan was valued at \u00a5586.4 billion ( $ 6-7 billion ) , with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga books/magazines in Japan ( equivalent to 15 issues per person ) .

  "/wiki/Jack_The_Ripper": "Jack the Ripper was an unidentified serial killer active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888 . In both the criminal case files and contemporary journalistic accounts , the killer was called the Whitechapel Murderer and Leather Apron . Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations . The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge . Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888 , and letters were received by media outlets and Scotland Yard from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer . The name Jack the Ripper originated in a letter written by an individual claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media . The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers ' circulation . The From Hell letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee came with half of a preserved human kidney , purportedly taken from one of the victims . The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as Jack the Ripper , mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal nature of the murders , and because of media treatment of the events . Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper , and the legend solidified . A police investigation into a series of eleven brutal killings in Whitechapel up to 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888 . Five victims - Mary Ann Nichols , Annie Chapman , Elizabeth Stride , Catherine Eddowes , and Mary Jane Kelly - are known as the canonical five and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked .",
