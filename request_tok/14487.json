  "/wiki/Listed_building": "A listed building , or listed structure , is one that has been placed on one of the four statutory lists maintained by Historic England in England , Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland , Cadw in Wales , and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency in Northern Ireland . The term has also been used in Ireland , where buildings are surveyed for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage in accordance with the country 's obligations under the Granada Convention . However , the preferred term in Ireland is protected structure . A listed building may not be demolished , extended , or altered without special permission from the local planning authority , which typically consults the relevant central government agency , particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings . In England and Wales , a national amenity society must be notified of any work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition . Exemption from secular listed building control is provided for some buildings in current use for worship , but only in cases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent permissions procedure . Owners of listed buildings are , in some circumstances , compelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they fail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations . When alterations are permitted , or when listed buildings are repaired or maintained , the owners are often required to use specific materials or techniques . Although most sites appearing on the lists are buildings , other structures such as bridges , monuments , sculptures , war memorials , and even milestones and mileposts and The Beatles ' Abbey Road pedestrian crossing are also listed . Ancient , military , and uninhabited structures , such as Stonehenge , are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and protected by much older legislation , whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently listed on a non-statutory basis .",
