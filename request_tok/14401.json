The message was intercepted by the government of the CAE , who decided that it was a coded message , and that Goldsmith was a South African spy . Goldsmith was taken to a prison , where he says that he was beaten personally by Bokassa , almost to death .",

  "/wiki/Eclipse_of_Reason": "Eclipse of Reason is a 1987 anti-abortion documentary video directed , filmed , and narrated by Bernard Nathanson , with an introduction by Charlton Heston . Eclipse of Reason is a follow up to Nathansons first film The Silent Scream . The film is perhaps most known for its controversial depiction of a dilation and evacuation ( D & E ) abortion . The subject matter of this film focuses more on the moral implications of abortion . It served as Nathansons call to the women of the world to end the practice of abortion . This film , as well as The Silent Scream , was instrumental in the Right to Life Committee 's garnering the attention of the United States public regarding the issue of abortion . Eclipse of Reason represented the argument that the fetus is human , and therefore abortion is murder . The film also serves to combat critics to The Silent Scream who argue that , although Nathanson claimed the film relied only on imagery and not pejorative speech , the film was heavily reliant on upon the language of the narrator . Therefore , Eclipse of Reason delivers the same message that abortion is murder , with similar imagery as its predecessor The Silent Scream ; however , to avoid the previous appropriation of language over imagery Eclipse of Reason asks it viewers to consider reason rather than using emotionally charged narration .",
