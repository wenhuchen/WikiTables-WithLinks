  "/wiki/Bob_Dylan": "Bob Dylan ( born Robert Allen Zimmerman ; May 24 , 1941 ) is an American singer-songwriter , author , and visual artist who has been a major figure in popular culture for more than fifty years . Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s , when songs such as Blowin ' in the Wind ( 1963 ) and The Times They Are a-Changin ' ( 1964 ) became anthems for the civil rights movement and anti-war movement . His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political , social , philosophical , and literary influences , defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture . Following his self-titled debut album in 1962 , which mainly comprised traditional folk songs , Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan the following year . The album featured Blowin ' in the Wind and the thematically complex A Hard Rain 's a- Gon na Fall . For many of these songs , he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs . He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin ' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964 . In 1965 and 1966 , Dylan encountered controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation , and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s : Bringing It All Back Home ( 1965 ) , Highway 61 Revisited ( 1965 ) and Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) . Commenting on the six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone ( 1965 ) , Rolling Stone wrote : No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time , for all time . In July 1966 , Dylan withdrew from touring after being injured in a motorcycle accident . During this period , he recorded a large body of songs with members of The Band , who had previously backed him on tour . These recordings were released as the collaborative album The Basement Tapes in 1975 .",
