  "intro": "Neil Robertson (born 11 February 1982) is an Australian professional snooker player. He made his first breakthrough into the top professional ranks in the 2006/2007 season. He won the 2010 World Championship and was the world number one later in the same year, a ranking that he attained again in 2013 and 2014. On 10 November, Neil Robertson won the 2019 Champion of Champions tournament for the second time in his career. Robertson is the only Australian to have won a ranking event, and was undefeated in his first six televised finals. Robertson is also one of thirteen players to win both the world and UK titles, and one of eleven to win the Triple Crown of World Championship, UK Championship and Masters. As a prolific break-builder, Robertson has compiled more than 700 century breaks in professional competition. During the 2013/2014 season he became the first player to make 100 centuries in a single season, and is still the only one. Robertson is the most successful player from outside the United Kingdom in the sport's history. He plays left-handed."
