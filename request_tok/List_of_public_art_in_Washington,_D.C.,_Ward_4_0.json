  "/wiki/Metal": "A metal ( from Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd m\u00e9tallon , mine , quarry , metal ) is a material that , when freshly prepared , polished , or fractured , shows a lustrous appearance , and conducts electricity and heat relatively well . Metals are typically malleable ( they can be hammered into thin sheets ) or ductile ( can be drawn into wires ) . A metal may be a chemical element such as iron ; an alloy such as stainless steel ; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride . In physics , a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero . Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures . For example , the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure . Equally , some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals . Sodium , for example , becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure . In chemistry , two elements that would otherwise qualify ( in physics ) as brittle metals - arsenic and antimony - are commonly instead recognised as metalloids , on account of their predominately non-metallic chemistry . Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals ( or are likely to be such ) . The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals , nonmetals , and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved . In astrophysics the term metal is cast more widely to refer to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two , hydrogen and helium , and not just traditional metals .",
  "/wiki/Stone": "A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter . It is categorized by the minerals included , its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed . Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups : igneous rocks , metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks . Rocks form the Earth 's outer solid layer , the crust . Igneous rocks are formed when magma cools in the Earth 's crust , or lava cools on the ground surface or the seabed . The metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to such large pressures and temperatures that they are transformed - something that occurs , for example , when continental plates collide . The sedimentary rocks are formed by diagenesis or lithification of sediments , which in turn are formed by the weathering , transport , and deposition of existing rocks . The scientific study of rocks is called petrology , which is an essential component of geology .",
  "/wiki/Tree_Trunk": "In botany , the trunk ( or bole ) is the stem and main wooden axis of a tree , which is an important feature in tree identification , and which often differs markedly from the bottom of the trunk to the top , depending on the species . The trunk is the most important part of the tree for timber production . Trunks occur both in true woody plants as well as non-woody plants such as palms and other monocots , though the internal physiology is different in each case . In all plants , trunks thicken over time due to formation of secondary growth ( or in monocots , pseudo-secondary growth ) . Trunks can be vulnerable to damage , including sunburn . Trunks which are cut down in logging are generally called logs and if cut to a specific length bolts . The term log is informally used in English to describe any felled trunk not rooted in the ground . A stump is the part of a trunk remaining in the ground after the tree has been felled .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior": "The United States Department of the Interior ( DOI ) is a federal executive department of the U.S. government . It is responsible for the management and conservation of most federal lands and natural resources , and the administration of programs relating to Native Americans , Alaska Natives , Native Hawaiians , territorial affairs , and insular areas of the United States . About 75% of federal public land is managed by the department , with most of the remainder managed by the United States Department of Agriculture 's United States Forest Service . The department is administered by the United States secretary of the interior , who is a member of the Cabinet of the president . The current secretary is David Bernhardt , who previously served in the Department as deputy secretary . The inspector general position is currently held by Mary Kendall , who is serving as acting inspector general . Despite its name , the Department of the Interior has a different role from that of the interior ministries of other nations , which are usually responsible for police matters and internal security . In the United States , national security and immigration functions are performed by the Department of Homeland Security primarily and the Department of Justice secondarily . The Department of the Interior has often been humorously called The Department of Everything Else because of its broad range of responsibilities .",

  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",
  "/wiki/Marble": "Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals , most commonly calcite or dolomite . Marble is typically not foliated , although there are exceptions . In geology , the term marble refers to metamorphosed limestone , but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone . Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material .",
  "/wiki/U.S._Army": "The United States Army ( USA ) is the land warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces . It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers . As a branch of the armed forces , the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation 's wars , by providing prompt , sustained land dominance , across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict , in support of combatant commanders . The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States .",
  "/wiki/Concrete": "Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement ( cement paste ) that hardens ( cures ) over time . In the past limebased cement binders were often used , such as lime putty , but sometimes with other hydraulic cements , such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete ( for its visual resemblance to Portland stone ) . Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with different methods of binding aggregate together , including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder , which is frequently used for road surfaces , and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder . When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water , the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape . The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses . Often , additives ( such as pozzolans or superplasticizers ) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material . Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials ( such as rebar ) embedded to provide tensile strength , yielding reinforced concrete . Because concrete cures ( which is not the same as drying such as with paint ) how concrete is handled after it is poured is just as important as before . Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials . Its usage worldwide , ton for ton , is twice that of steel , wood , plastics , and aluminum combined . Globally , the ready-mix concrete industry , the largest segment of the concrete market , is projected to exceed $ 600 billion in revenue by 2025 . Concrete is distinct from mortar .",

  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume , and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

Raised in New York City , he traveled to Europe for further training and artistic study . After he returned to New York , he achieved major critical success for his monuments commemorating heroes of the American Civil War , many of which still stand . Saint-Gaudens created works such as the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial on Boston Common and grand equestrian monuments to Civil War generals : General John Logan Memorial in Chicago 's Grant Park and William Tecumseh Sherman at the corner of New York 's Central Park . Saint-Gaudens also created Classical works such as the Diana . He also used his design skills in numismatics . Most notably , he designed the $ 20 Saint Gaudens Double Eagle gold piece ( 1905-1907 ) for the US Mint , considered one of the most beautiful American coins ever issued , as well as the $ 10 Indian Head gold eagle ; both of these were minted from 1907 until 1933 . In his later years he founded the Cornish Colony , an artistic colony that included notable painters , sculptors , writers , and architects . His brother Louis Saint-Gaudens , with whom he occasionally collaborated , was also a well-known sculptor ."
