It lies between the coast of northwestern continental Europe and the range of low-lying Frisian Islands , forming a shallow body of water with tidal flats and wetlands . It has a high biological diversity and is an important area for both breeding and migrating birds . In 2009 , the Dutch and German parts of the Wadden Sea were inscribed on UNESCO 's World Heritage List and the Danish part was added in June 2014 . The Wadden Sea stretches from Den Helder , in the northwest of the Netherlands , past the great river estuaries of Germany to its northern boundary at Skallingen in Denmark along a total coastline of some 500 km ( 310 mi ) and a total area of about 10,000 km2 ( 3,900 sq mi ) . Within the Netherlands it is bounded from the IJsselmeer by the Afsluitdijk . Historically , the coastal regions were often subjected to large floods , resulting in thousands of deaths , including the Saint Marcellus ' flood of 1219 , Burchardi flood of 1634 and Christmas Flood of 1717 . Some of these also significantly changed the coastline . Numerous dikes and causeways have been built , and as a result recent floods have resulted in few or no fatalities ( even if some dikes rarely and locally have been overrun in recent history ) . This makes it among the most human-altered habitats on the planet .",
