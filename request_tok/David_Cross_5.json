  "/wiki/The_Ben_Stiller_Show": "The Ben Stiller Show is an American sketch comedy series that aired on MTV from 1990 to 1991 , and then on Fox from September 27 , 1992 to January 17 , 1993 . The Fox program starred Ben Stiller , Andy Dick , Janeane Garofalo and Bob Odenkirk . Character actor John F. O'Donohue also appeared in every episode . The program featured numerous filmed comedy segments , many of which parodied middle of the 1980s to beginning of the 1990s pop culture . Despite mostly positive reviews , Fox cancelled the series after only thirteen episodes , due to low ratings . Unlike most sketch comedy programs , The Ben Stiller Show did not use a studio audience or a laugh track , and was the first ever Fox sketch comedy program not to use a laugh track . The semi spinoff , The Andy Dick Show , used the same format . After cancellation , the series won the 1993 Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program .",
  "/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Writing_for_a_Variety,_Music_or_Comedy_Program": "The Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series debuted in 1966 , and has been annually awarded most years since the mid-1960s . It has had a large number of name changes , mostly involving the addition or subtraction of the word comedy . Generally , the category has recognized the writers of variety and sketch comedy shows . However , in 1969 , 1970 and 1979 , it was the main category for writers of situation comedies . Prior to 1966 , variety series were eligible in Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series where The Red Skelton Show and other variety programs were occasionally nominated . For most of the 1970s , the category was effectively split into two branches . From 1971 to 1978 , one-off specials were awarded separately from ongoing series . The divide was reinstated in 2009 as Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special . The writers of one-off variety specials competed against series writers in the interim , and occasionally won , as in 1991 and 2000 . This has led to some anomalies , such as when a special edition of Late Night with David Letterman beat out regular editions of The Tracey Ullman Show and Saturday Night Live in 1987 , despite the fact that typical episodes of Late Night were not nominated that year . The category eventually found greater stability with its name in 1982 , when it settled on Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program for almost two decades . In 2000 , it added the word comedy .",

The original challenge Popular Arts faced was how to repurpose recorded stand-up comedy material . To do so , they based Dr. Katz 's patients on stand-up comics for the first several episodes , simply having them recite their stand-up acts . The secondary challenge was how to affordably animate on cable TV at the time . Snyder ( a boyhood friend of Braine 's ) had Squigglevision , an inexpensive means of getting animation on cable , which could not afford traditional animation processes . A partnership between Popular Arts , Tom Snyder Productions and Jonathan Katz was formed , and thus , Dr. Katz , Professional Therapist was born .",
