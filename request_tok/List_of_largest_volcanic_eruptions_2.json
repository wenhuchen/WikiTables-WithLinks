The OJP was emplaced around 120 million years ago ( Ma ) with a much smaller volcanic event around 90 Ma . Two other southwestern Pacific plateaus , Manihiki and Hikurangi , now separated from the OJP by Cretaceous ocean basins , are of similar age and composition and probably formed as a single plateau and a contiguous large igneous province together with the OJP . When emplaced this Ontong Java-Manihiki-Hikurangi plateau covered 1% of Earth 's surface and represented a volume of 80 million km3 ( 19 million cu mi ) of basaltic magma . This Ontong Java event , first proposed in 1991 , represents the largest volcanic event of the past 200 million years , with a magma emplacement rate estimated at up to 22 km3 ( 5.3 cu mi ) per year over 3 million years , several times larger than the Deccan Traps . The smooth surface of the OJP is punctuated by seamounts such as the Ontong Java Atoll , the largest atoll in the world .",

Notable eruptions have included that of Eldgj\u00e1 , a fissure of Katla , in 934 ( the world 's largest basaltic eruption ever witnessed ) , Laki in 1783 ( the world 's second largest ) , and several eruptions beneath ice caps , which have generated devastating glacial bursts , most recently in 2010 after the eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull . Iceland 's location astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , where the Eurasian and North American Plates are moving apart , is partly responsible for this intense volcanic activity , but an additional cause is necessary to explain why Iceland is a substantial island while the rest of the ridge mostly consists of seamounts , with peaks below sea level . As well as being a region of higher temperature than the surrounding mantle , it is believed to have a higher concentration of water . The presence of water in magma reduces the melting temperature , which may also play a role in enhancing Icelandic volcanism .",

It is the Earth 's most severe known extinction event , with up to 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species becoming extinct . It was the largest known mass extinction of insects . Some 57% of all biological families and 83% of all genera became extinct . There is evidence for one to three distinct pulses , or phases , of extinction . Potential causes for those pulses include one or more large meteor impact events , massive volcanic eruptions ( such as the Siberian Traps ) , and climate change brought on by large releases of underwater methane or methane-producing microbes . The speed of the recovery from the extinction is disputed . Some scientists estimate that it took 10 million years ( until the Middle Triassic ) , due both to the severity of the extinction and because grim conditons returned periodically for another 5 million years . However , studies in Bear Lake County , near Paris , Idaho , showed a relatively quick rebound in a localized Early Triassic marine ecosystem , taking around 2 million years to recover , suggesting that the impact of the extinction may have been felt less severely in some areas than others .",
  "/wiki/Extinction_event": "An extinction event ( also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis ) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth . Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms . It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation . Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty . These differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as major , and the data chosen to measure past diversity . Because most diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial , and thus difficult to measure , recorded extinction events affect the easily observed , biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life . Extinction occurs at an uneven rate . Based on the fossil record , the background rate of extinctions on Earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine animals every million years . Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to land animals . The Great Oxygenation Event , which occurred around 2.45 billion years ago , was probably the first major extinction event . Since the Cambrian explosion , five further major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate . The most recent and arguably best-known , the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event , which occurred approximately 66 million years ago ( Ma ) , was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time .",

Its flood basalt mostly covers South Africa and Antarctica but portions extend further into southern Africa and into South America , India , Australia and New Zealand . Karoo-Ferrar formed just prior to the breakup of Gondwana in the Lower Jurassic epoch , about 183 million years ago ; this timing corresponds to the early Toarcian anoxic event and the Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction . It covered about 3 x 106 km2 .

The Ferrar LIP is notable for long distance transport and the Karoo LIP for its large volume and chemical diversity . The igneous activity of the Karoo LIP began c. 204 Ma at the northern margin of the province . The long-lasting Chon-Aike Province in Patagonia , the Antarctic Peninsula , and Ellsworth Land was activated c. 190 Ma in an unstable tectonic environment in which both extension and subduction occurred . Chon-Aike had a peak between 183 to 173 Ma but produced continued magmatism between 168 to 141 Ma . By 184 to 175 Ma the Karoo magmatism had spread to Namibia , Lesotho , Lebombo , and the Ferrar province in Antarctica .

The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 .

Originally , the Deccan Traps may have covered c. 1,500,000 km2 ( 600,000 sq mi ) , with a correspondingly larger original volume .",
  "/wiki/Deccan_Plateau": "The Deccan Plateau is a large plateau in western and southern Indian Subcontinent . It rises to 100 metres ( 330 ft ) in the north , and to more than 1,000 metres ( 3,300 ft ) in the south , forming a raised triangle within the south-pointing triangle of the Indian subcontinent 's coastline . It extends over eight Indian states and encompasses a wide range of habitats , covering significant parts of Telangana , Maharashtra , Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh . The plateau is located between two mountain ranges , the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats , each of which rises from its respective nearby coastal plain , and almost converge at the southern tip of India . It is separated from the Gangetic plain to the north by the Satpura and Vindhya Ranges , which form its northern boundary . The Deccan produced some of the major dynasties in Indian history including Pallavas , Satavahana , Vakataka , Chalukya , and Rashtrakuta dynasties , the Western Chalukya , the Kadamba Dynasty , Kakatiya Empire , Kamma Nayakas , Vijayanagara and Maratha empires and the Muslim Bahmani Sultanate , Deccan Sultanate , and the Nizam of Hyderabad .",
  "/wiki/Dinosaurs": "Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles [ note 1 ] of the clade Dinosauria . They first appeared during the Triassic period , between 243 and 233.23 million years ago , although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research . They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago ; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods . The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs , having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch . As such , birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago . Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs , or birds ; and non-avian dinosaurs , which are all dinosaurs other than birds . Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic , morphological and ecological standpoints . Birds , at over 10,000 living species , are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish . Using fossil evidence , paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs . Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species ( birds ) and fossil remains . Through the first half of the 20th century , before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs , most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded . Most research conducted since the 1970s , however , has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction .",
  "/wiki/Emeishan_Traps": "The Emeishan Traps constitute a flood basalt volcanic province , or large igneous province , in south-western China , centred in Sichuan province . It is sometimes referred to as the Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province or Emeishan Flood Basalts . Like other volcanic provinces or traps , the Emeishan Traps are multiple layers of igneous rock laid down by large mantle plume volcanic eruptions . The Emeishan Traps eruptions were serious enough to have global ecological and paleontological impact . It is named for Emeishan , a mountain in Sichuan .",

  "/wiki/Mackenzie_Large_Igneous_Province": "The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province ( MLIP ) is a major Mesoproterozoic large igneous province of the southwestern , western and northwestern Canadian Shield in Canada . It consists of a group of related igneous rocks that were formed during a massive igneous event starting about 1,270 million years ago . The large igneous province extends from the Arctic in Nunavut to near the Great Lakes in Northwestern Ontario where it meets with the smaller Matachewan dike swarm . Included in the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are the large Muskox layered intrusion , the Coppermine River flood basalt sequence and the massive northwesterly trending Mackenzie dike swarm . As a large igneous province , it is an extremely large area of related igneous rocks that were emplaced over an extremely short geological time span . The igneous rocks comprising the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province originated from processes not associated with normal plate tectonics and seafloor spreading . It is one of the several large igneous provinces scattered throughout the Canadian landscape , which can be thousands of kilometres in volume and area . The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province is one of the world 's largest Proterozoic magmatic provinces , as well as one of the most well-preserved continental flood basalt terrains on Earth . Igneous rocks of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are generally mafic in composition , including basalt and gabbro . Even though the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province is classified as a large igneous province like other extremely large accumulations of igneous rocks on Earth , it is much larger than large igneous province standards . The standard size classification for large igneous provinces is a minimum areal extent of 100,000 km2 ( 39,000 sq mi ) . However , the Mackenzie dike swarm itself occupies an area of at least 2,700,000 km2 ( 1,000,000 sq mi ) , making the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province larger than the Ontong Java Plateau ( in the southwestern Pacific Ocean ) and the U.S. state of Alaska .",

It shares borders with Eritrea to the north , Djibouti to the northeast , Somalia , and the de facto state of Somaliland to the east , Kenya to the south , South Sudan to the west and Sudan to the northwest . With over 109 million inhabitants , Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent with a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres ( 420,000 sq mi ) . Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",

  "/wiki/Arabian-Nubian_Shield": "The Arabian-Nubian Shield ( ANS ) is an exposure of Precambrian crystalline rocks on the flanks of the Red Sea . The crystalline rocks are mostly Neoproterozoic in age . Geographically - and from north to south - the ANS includes parts of Israel , Palestine , Jordan , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Yemen , and Somalia . The ANS in the north is exposed as part of the Sahara Desert and Arabian Desert , and in the south in the Ethiopian Highlands , Asir province of Arabia and Yemen Highlands . The ANS was the site of some of man 's earliest geologic efforts , principally by the ancient Egyptians to extract gold from the rocks of Egypt and NE Sudan . This was the most easily worked of all metals and does not tarnish . All of the gold deposits in Egypt and northern Sudan were found and exploited by Egyptians . The earliest preserved geologic map was made in 1150 BCE to show the location of gold deposits in Eastern Egypt ; it is known as the Turin papyrus . New gold discoveries have been found in Sudan , Eritrea , and Saudi Arabia . Pharonic Egyptians also quarried granite near Aswan and floated this down the Nile to be used as facing for the pyramids . The Greek name for Aswan , Syene ; is the type locality for the igneous rock syenite . The Romans followed this tradition and had many quarries especially in the northern part of the Eastern Desert of Egypt where porphyry and granite were mined and shaped for shipment .",

  "/wiki/Pacific_Northwest": "The Pacific Northwest ( PNW ) , sometimes referred to as Cascadia , is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and ( loosely ) by the Rocky Mountains on the east . Though no official boundary exists , the most common conception includes the Canadian province of British Columbia ( BC ) and the U.S. states of Idaho , Oregon , and Washington . Broader conceptions reach north into Southeast Alaska and Yukon , south into northern California , and east to the Continental Divide to include Western Montana and parts of Wyoming . Narrower conceptions may be limited to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains . The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region 's history , culture , geography , society , and other factors . The Northwest Coast is the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest , and the Northwest Plateau ( also commonly known as the Interior in British Columbia and the Inland Northwest in the United States ) is the inland region . The term Pacific Northwest should not be confused with the Northwest Territory ( also known as the Great Northwest , a historical term in the United States ) or the Northwest Territories of Canada . The region 's largest metropolitan areas are Greater Seattle , Washington , with 3.8 million people ; Metro Vancouver , British Columbia , with 2.5 million people ; and Greater Portland , Oregon , with 2.4 million people . The culture of the Pacific Northwest is influenced by the Canada-United States border , which the United States and the United Kingdom established at a time when the region 's inhabitants were composed mostly of indigenous peoples . Two sections of the border - one along the 49th parallel south of British Columbia and one between the Alaska Panhandle and northern British Columbia - have left a great impact on the region . According to Canadian historian Ken Coates , the border has not merely influenced the Pacific Northwest - rather , the region 's history and character have been determined by the boundary .",
  "/wiki/Missoula_Floods": "The Missoula floods ( also known as the Spokane floods or the Bretz floods or Bretz 's floods ) refer to the cataclysmic floods that swept periodically across eastern Washington and down the Columbia River Gorge at the end of the last ice age . The glacial flood events have been researched since the 1920s . These glacial lake outburst floods were the result of periodic sudden ruptures of the ice dam on the Clark Fork River that created Glacial Lake Missoula . After each ice dam rupture , the waters of the lake would rush down the Clark Fork and the Columbia River , flooding much of eastern Washington and the Willamette Valley in western Oregon . After the rupture , the ice would reform , creating Glacial Lake Missoula again . During the last deglaciation that followed the end of the Last Glacial Maximum , geologists estimate that a cycle of flooding and reformation of the lake lasted an average of 55 years and that the floods occurred several times over the 2,000-year period between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago . U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist Jim O'Connor and Spanish Center of Environmental Studies scientist Gerard Benito have found evidence of at least twenty-five massive floods , the largest discharging about 10 cubic kilometers per hour ( 2.7 million m\u00b3/s , 13 times the Amazon River ) . Alternate estimates for the peak flow rate of the largest flood include 17 cubic kilometers per hour and range up to 60 cubic kilometers per hour . The maximum flow speed approached 36 meters/second ( 130 km/h or 80 mph ) . Within the Columbia River drainage basin , detailed investigation of the Missoula floods ' glaciofluvial deposits , informally known as the Hanford formation , has documented the presence of Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits within the Othello Channels , Columbia River Gorge , Channeled Scabland , Quincy Basin , Pasco Basin , and the Walla Walla Valley . Based on the presence of multiple interglacial calcretes interbedded with flood deposits , magnetostratigraphy , optically stimulated luminescence dating , and unconformity truncated clastic dikes , it has been estimated that the oldest of the Pleistocene Missoula floods happened before 1.5 million years ago . Because of the fragmentary nature of older glaciofluvial deposits , which have been largely removed by subsequent Missoula floods , within the Hanford formation , the exact number of older Missoula floods , which are known as ancient cataclysmic floods , that occurred during the Pleistocene can not be estimated with any confidence .",
  "/wiki/Channeled_Scablands": "The Channeled Scablands at one time were a relatively barren and soil-free region of interconnected relict and dry flood channels , coulees and cataracts eroded into Palouse loess and the typically flat-lying basalt flows that remain after cataclysmic floods within the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Washington . The channeled scablands were scoured by more than 40 cataclysmic floods during the Last Glacial Maximum and innumerable older cataclysmic floods over the last two million years . These cataclysmic floods were repeatedly unleashed when a large glacial lake repeatedly drained and swept across eastern Washington and down the Columbia River Plateau during the Pleistocene epoch . The last of the cataclysmic floods occurred between 18,200 and 14,000 years ago . Geologist J Harlen Bretz defined scablands in a series of papers written in the 1920s as lowlands diversified by a multiplicity of irregular channels and rock basins eroded into basalt . Flood waters eroded the loess cover , creating large anastomizing channels that exposed bare basalt and creating butte-and-basin topography . The buttes range in height from 30 to 100 m , while the rock basins range from 10 m in width up to the 11 km long and 30 m deep Rock Lake . Bretz further stated , The channels run uphill and downhill , they unite and they divide , they head on the back-slopes and cut through the summit ; they could not be more erratically and impossibly designed . The debate on the origin of the Scablands that ensued for four decades became one of the great controversies in the history of earth science . The Scablands are also important to planetary scientists as perhaps the best terrestrial analog of the Martian outflow channels ."
