  "/wiki/Dieppe_Raid": "Operation Jubilee , more commonly referred to as the Dieppe Raid , was an Allied assault on the German-occupied port of Dieppe , France , on 19 August 1942 , during the Second World War . The main assault lasted less than six hours until strong German defences and mounting Allied losses forced its commanders to call a retreat . Over 6,050 infantrymen , predominantly Canadian , were supported by The Calgary Regiment of the 1st Canadian Tank Brigade and a strong force of Royal Navy and smaller Royal Air Force landing contingents . It involved 5,000 Canadians , 1,000 British troops , and 50 United States Army Rangers . Objectives included seizing and holding a major port for a short period , both to prove that it was possible and to gather intelligence . Upon retreat , the Allies also wanted to destroy coastal defences , port structures and all strategic buildings . The raid had the added objectives of boosting morale and demonstrating the firm commitment of the United Kingdom to open a western front in Europe . Virtually none [ clarification needed ] of these objectives were met . Allied fire support was grossly inadequate and the raiding force was largely trapped on the beach by obstacles and German fire . Within 10 hours of the first landings the last Allied troops had been killed , evacuated , or left behind to be captured by the Germans . Instead of a demonstration of resolve the bloody fiasco showed the world that the Allies could not hope to invade France for a long time . Some intelligence successes were achieved , including electronic intelligence .",
  "/wiki/Second_World_War": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

  "/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom": "George III ( George William Frederick ; 4 June 1738 [ c ] - 29 January 1820 ) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of the two countries on 1 January 1801 , after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death in 1820 . He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( Hanover ) in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814 . He was a monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors , he was born in Great Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover . George 's life and reign , which were longer than those of any of his predecessors , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas , and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India . However , many of Britain 's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence . Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . In the later part of his life , George had recurrent , and eventually permanent , mental illness . Although it has since been suggested that he had bipolar disorder or the blood disease porphyria , the cause of his illness remains unknown . After a final relapse in 1810 , a regency was established . His eldest son , George , Prince of Wales , ruled as Prince Regent until his father 's death , when he succeeded as George IV .

  "/wiki/Duke_of_York": "Duke of York is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom . Since the 15th century , it has , when granted , usually been given to the second son of English ( later British ) monarchs . The equivalent title in the Scottish peerage was Duke of Albany . However , King George I and Queen Victoria granted the second sons of their eldest sons the titles Duke of York and Albany and Duke of York respectively . Initially granted in the 14th century in the Peerage of England , the title Duke of York has been created eight times . The title Duke of York and Albany has been created three times . These occurred during the 18th century , following the 1707 unification of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into a single , united realm . The double naming was done so that a territorial designation from each of the previously separate realms could be included . The current Duke of York is Prince Andrew , the second son of Queen Elizabeth II . The present Duke 's marriage produced two daughters only , and he has remained unmarried since his 1996 divorce . It therefore seems likely that the eighth creation of the title will be only the second ( after Richard of Shrewsbury ) not to become merged into the Crown upon the holder 's accession to the role of monarch .",

Situated in the Petitcodiac River Valley , Moncton lies at the geographic centre of the Maritime Provinces . The city has earned the nickname Hub City due to its central inland location in the region and its history as a railway and land transportation hub for the Maritimes . The city proper has a population of 71,889 ( 2016 ) and a land area of 142 km2 ( 55 sq mi ) . Greater Moncton has a population of 144,810 ( 2016 ) , making it the largest city and census metropolitan area ( CMA ) in New Brunswick , and the second-largest city and CMA in the Maritime Provinces .

Although the Moncton area was first settled in 1733 , Moncton was officially founded in 1766 with the arrival of Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants from Philadelphia . Initially an agricultural settlement , Moncton was not incorporated until 1855 . The city was named for Lt. Col. Robert Monckton , the British officer who had captured nearby Fort Beaus\u00e9jour a century earlier . A significant wooden shipbuilding industry had developed in the community by the mid-1840s , allowing for the civic incorporation in 1855 .

  "/wiki/Fort_Beaus\u00e9jour": "During the 1600s and 1700s , European monarchies were nearly continuously at war with each other . The threat of Anglo-American invasion of New France was constant , as England tried to establish power in North America , and Acadia was particularly vulnerable to attacks by water . Its capital , Port-Royal , was founded in 1605 , destroyed by the British in 1613 , moved upstream in 1632 , besieged by the British in 1707 , and finally taken in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1710 ) . Under the terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , the Kingdom of France had ceded to the Kingdom of Great Britain the territory known today as mainland Nova Scotia . The treaty stated that France retained control of \u00cele Royale ( now Cape Breton Island ) and \u00cele Saint-Jean ( Prince Edward Island ) . France 's colony Canada , or New France , extended from the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula in the east to Quebec in the west . The treaty of Utrecht defined neither which nation had sovereignty over the land between Gaspesie and Nova Scotia , now New Brunswick , nor the western border of Nova Scotia . The de facto border became the Isthmus of Chignecto at the Missiguash River , site of the prosperous Acadian settlement Beaubassin . In the mid-1700s France and Britain were about to clash worldwide and in North America in the Seven Years ' War . By the middle of the 1700s , over one million British colonists occupied a limited area along the Atlantic coast , but the primarily ethnic French population of what is now The Maritimes was 18,544 , part of a total New France population of 70,000 .",

Saint John is the oldest incorporated city in Canada . During the reign of George III , the municipality was created by royal charter in 1785 . Saint John is the oldest of five chartered cities in Canada along with Montreal , Winnipeg , Vancouver , and Lloydminster ( a city that straddles both Alberta and Saskatchewan ) . French colonist Samuel de Champlain landed at Saint John Harbour on June 24 , 1604 ( the feast of St. John the Baptist ) and is where the Saint John River gets its name although Mi'kmaq and Maliseet peoples lived in the region for thousands of years prior calling the river Wolastoq . The Saint John area was an important area for trade and defence for Acadia during the French colonial era and Fort La Tour , in the city 's harbour , was a pivotal battleground during the Acadian Civil War . After over a century of ownership disputes over the land surrounding Saint John between the French and English , the English deported the French colonists in 1755 and constructed Fort Howe above the harbour in 1779 . In 1785 , the City of Saint John was established by uniting the two towns of Parrtown and Carleton on each side of the harbour after the arrival of thousands of refugees from the American Revolution who wished to remain British and were forced to leave their U.S. homes . Over the next century , waves of immigration via Partridge Island , especially during the Great Famine , would fundamentally change the city 's demographics and culture .",
  "/wiki/John_the_Baptist": "John the Baptist [ note 1 ] ( late 1st century BC - 28-36 AD ) was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early 1st century AD . Other titles for John include John the Forerunner in Eastern Christianity , John the Immerser in some Baptist traditions , and the prophet John ( Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ) in Islam . He is sometimes alternatively called John the Baptizer . John the Baptist is mentioned by the Hebrew historian Josephus and revered as a major religious figure in Christianity , Islam , the Bah\u00e1 ' \u00ed Faith , and Mandaeism . He is called a prophet by all of these faiths , and is honored as a saint in many Christian traditions . According to the New Testament , John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself , and the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus , since John announces Jesus ' coming and prepares the people for Jesus ' ministry . Jesus himself identifies John as Elijah who is to come , which some biblical scholars interpret to mean that Jesus believed that John was the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Elijah , although John the Baptist in the Gospel of John explicitly denies being linked to Elijah ( John 1:21 ) . According to the New Testament , John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth were relatives . Some scholars maintain that John belonged to the Essenes , a semi-ascetic Judaic sect who expected a Hebrew messiah and who practiced ritual baptism . John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement . Most scholars agree that John baptized Jesus , and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus ' early followers had previously been followers of John .
