  "/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)": "The Republican Party , also referred to as the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States ; the other is its historic rival , the Democratic Party . The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories . The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions . After the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade , the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals .",

This position corresponds to what is generally known as a defense minister in many other countries . The secretary of defense is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate , and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council . The secretary of defense is a statutory office , and the general provision in 10 U.S.C . \u00a7 113 provides that subject to the direction of the President , its occupant has authority , direction and control over the Department of Defense . The same statute further designates the secretary as the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to the Department of Defense . To ensure civilian control of the military , no one may be appointed as the secretary of defense within seven years of serving as a commissioned officer of a regular ( i.e. , non-reserve ) component of an armed force . Subject only to the orders of the president , the secretary of defense is in the chain of command and exercises command and control , for both operational and administrative purposes , over all Department of Defense forces - the Army , Marine Corps , Navy , and Air Force - as well as the U.S. Coast Guard when its command and control is transferred to the Department of Defense . Only the secretary of defense ( or the president or Congress ) can authorize the transfer of operational control of forces between the three military departments ( the departments of the Army , Navy , and Air Force ) and the 10 Combatant Commands ( Africa Command , Central Command , European Command , Indo-Pacific Command , Northern Command , Southern Command , Cyber Command , Special Operations Command , Strategic Command , Transportation Command ) . Because the Office of Secretary of Defense is vested with legal powers that exceed those of any commissioned officer , and is second only to the president in the military hierarchy , its incumbent has sometimes unofficially been referred to as a de facto deputy commander-in-chief . ( The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the principal military adviser to the secretary of defense and the president , and while the chairman may assist the secretary and president in their command functions , the chairman is not in the chain of command . )",

Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s .

  "/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan": "The presidency of Ronald Reagan began at noon EST on January 20 , 1981 , when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as the 40th President of the United States , and ended on January 20 , 1989 . Reagan , a Republican from California , took office following a landslide victory over Democratic incumbent President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election . Reagan was succeeded by his Vice President , George H. W. Bush , who won the 1988 presidential election with Reagan 's support . Reagan 's 1980 election resulted from a dramatic conservative shift to the right in American politics , including a loss of confidence in liberal , New Deal , and Great Society programs and priorities that had dominated the national agenda since the 1930s . Domestically , the Reagan administration enacted a major tax cut , sought to cut non-military spending , and eliminated federal regulations . The administration 's economic policies , known as Reaganomics , were inspired by supply-side economics . The combination of tax cuts and an increase in defense spending led to budget deficits , and the federal debt increased significantly during Reagan 's tenure . Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( which simplified the tax code by reducing rates and removing several tax breaks ) and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ( which enacted sweeping changes to U.S. immigration law and granted amnesty to three million illegal immigrants ) . Reagan also appointed more federal judges than any other president , including four Supreme Court Justices . Reagan 's foreign policy stance was resolutely anti-communist ; its plan of action , known as the Reagan Doctrine , sought to roll back the global influence of the Soviet Union in an attempt to end the Cold War . Under this doctrine , the Reagan administration initiated a massive buildup of the United States military ; promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems ; and , in 1983 , undertook an invasion of Grenada , the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the Vietnam War . The administration also created controversy by granting aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow leftist governments , particularly in war-torn Central America and Afghanistan .",
