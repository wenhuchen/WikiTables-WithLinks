  "/wiki/Federalist_Party": "The Federalist Party was the first political party in the United States . Under Alexander Hamilton , it dominated the national government from 1789 to 1801 . It became a minority party while keeping its stronghold in New England and made a brief resurgence by opposing the War of 1812 . It then collapsed with its last presidential candidate in 1816 . Remnants lasted in a few places for a few years . The party appealed to businesses and to conservatives who favored banks , national over state government , manufacturing , an army and navy , and in world affairs preferred Great Britain and opposed the French Revolution . The Federalists called for a strong national government that promoted economic growth and fostered friendly relationships with Great Britain in opposition to Revolutionary France . It controlled the federal government until 1801 , when it was overwhelmed by the Democratic-Republican opposition led by Thomas Jefferson . The Federalist Party came into being between 1792 and 1794 as a national coalition of bankers and businessmen in support of Hamilton 's fiscal policies . These supporters worked in every state to build an organized party committed to a fiscally sound and nationalistic government . The only Federalist President was John Adams . George Washington was broadly sympathetic to the Federalist program , but he remained officially non-partisan during his entire presidency .",

  "/wiki/Virginia's_9th_congressional_district": "Virginia 's ninth congressional district is a United States congressional district in the Commonwealth of Virginia , covering much of the southwestern part of the state . The 9th is Virginia 's second-largest district in area , covering 9,113.87 square miles ( slightly larger than the whole state of New Jersey ) . Since 2011 it has been represented by Morgan Griffith ( R ) , who took office after defeating Rick Boucher ( D ) , the district 's representative for 1983-2011 . The largely white district was aligned with the Democratic Party well into the 20th century , when Virginia was among the Solid South states and African Americans were disenfranchised . Since the 1990s its voters have increasingly cast ballots for Republican presidential candidates . It last supported a Democrat for president in 1996 , and has supported a Democrat in only two statewide contests since then . Since the late 2000s , the 9th district has trended towards the Republican Party despite its historic support for the Democratic Party . The 9th is the only district in Virginia that cast more votes for Hillary Clinton than Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary . Clinton won more than 60% of the vote , despite local Congressman Rick Boucher endorsing Obama . Republican presidential candidate John McCain received 59% of the vote in the 9th district in the 2008 General Election , however , his best performance in any of Virginia 's eleven congressional districts . Voters in the 9th district supported McCain over Obama in the general election , despite reelecting Democratic Congressman Rick Boucher . In the 2010 Congressional midterm elections , in which Democrats lost their majority in Congress , Virginia State Delegate Morgan Griffith unseated Congressman Boucher by aligning Boucher with President Barack Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi , both unpopular figures in the district at the time .",

  "/wiki/Virginia's_9th_congressional_district_special_election,_1798": "Elections to the United States House of Representatives for the 6th Congress took place in 1798 and 1799 , the earliest in New York in April 1798 , and the latest in Tennessee in August 1799 , after the official start of the 6th Congress on March 4 , 1799 , but before the start of the first session of this Congress in Philadelphia on December 2 , 1799 . It was the last congressional session before the move to the new capital at Washington , D.C. President John Adams , a Federalist elected two years prior in the election of 1796 , remained popular during a time of national economic growth , [ citation needed ] and the Federalists made a modest gain of three seats at the expense of the opposition Democratic-Republicans , the party of Vice President and future President Thomas Jefferson . This resulted in an increased Federalist majority in the House , 60-46 seats . The Federalist party squandered its popularity by passing a series of controversial new laws in the summer of 1798 , including the Naturalization Act of 1798 and the Alien and Sedition Acts . Their passage seriously injured the chances of President Adams and Federalist congressional candidates in the elections of 1800 . The House that met during this Congress would ultimately elect Thomas Jefferson over Aaron Burr in the presidential election of 1800 .",
