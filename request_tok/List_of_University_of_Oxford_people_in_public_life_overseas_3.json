  "/wiki/Puerto_Rico": "Puerto Rico [ a ] ( Spanish for Rich Port ; abbreviated PR ) , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico , lit . Free Associated State of Puerto Rico ) [ b ] and briefly called Porto Rico , [ c ] is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea , approximately 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) southeast of Miami , Florida . An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , located between the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory 's total population is approximately 3.4 million , more than 21 U.S. states . Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements . On September 23 , 1868 , Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule , declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Ricans as a distinct people , with right to sovereignty .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense": "The secretary of defense ( SecDef ) is the leader and chief executive officer of the United States Department of Defense , the executive department of the Armed Forces of the U.S . The secretary of defense 's position of command and authority over the U.S. military is second only to that of the president . This position corresponds to what is generally known as a defense minister in many other countries . The secretary of defense is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate , and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council . The secretary of defense is a statutory office , and the general provision in 10 U.S.C . \u00a7 113 provides that subject to the direction of the President , its occupant has authority , direction and control over the Department of Defense . The same statute further designates the secretary as the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to the Department of Defense . To ensure civilian control of the military , no one may be appointed as the secretary of defense within seven years of serving as a commissioned officer of a regular ( i.e. , non-reserve ) component of an armed force . Subject only to the orders of the president , the secretary of defense is in the chain of command and exercises command and control , for both operational and administrative purposes , over all Department of Defense forces - the Army , Marine Corps , Navy , and Air Force - as well as the U.S. Coast Guard when its command and control is transferred to the Department of Defense . Only the secretary of defense ( or the president or Congress ) can authorize the transfer of operational control of forces between the three military departments ( the departments of the Army , Navy , and Air Force ) and the 10 Combatant Commands ( Africa Command , Central Command , European Command , Indo-Pacific Command , Northern Command , Southern Command , Cyber Command , Special Operations Command , Strategic Command , Transportation Command ) . Because the Office of Secretary of Defense is vested with legal powers that exceed those of any commissioned officer , and is second only to the president in the military hierarchy , its incumbent has sometimes unofficially been referred to as a de facto deputy commander-in-chief . ( The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the principal military adviser to the secretary of defense and the president , and while the chairman may assist the secretary and president in their command functions , the chairman is not in the chain of command . )",
