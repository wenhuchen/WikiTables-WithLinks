  "/wiki/Integrated_development_environment": "An integrated development environment ( IDE ) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development . An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor , build automation tools and a debugger . Some IDEs , such as NetBeans and Eclipse , contain the necessary compiler , interpreter , or both ; others , such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus , do not . The boundary between an IDE and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined ; sometimes a version control system or various tools to simplify the construction of a graphical user interface ( GUI ) are integrated . Many modern IDEs also have a class browser , an object browser , and a class hierarchy diagram for use in object-oriented software development .",

Under United States copyright law , all software is copyright protected , in both source code and object code forms , unless that software was developed by the United States Government , in which case it can not be copyrighted . Authors of copyrighted software can donate their software to the public domain , in which case it is also not covered by copyright and , as a result , can not be licensed . A typical software license grants the licensee , typically an end-user , permission to use one or more copies of software in ways where such a use would otherwise potentially constitute copyright infringement of the software owner 's exclusive rights under copyright .",
  "/wiki/Platform_(computing)": "A computing platform or digital platform is the environment in which a piece of software is executed . It may be the hardware or the operating system ( OS ) , even a web browser and associated application programming interfaces , or other underlying software , as long as the program code is executed with it . Computing platforms have different abstraction levels , including a computer architecture , an OS , or runtime libraries . A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run . A platform can be seen both as a constraint on the software development process , in that different platforms provide different functionality and restrictions ; and as an assistant to the development process , in that they provide low-level functionality ready-made . For example , an OS may be a platform that abstracts the underlying differences in hardware and provides a generic command for saving files or accessing the network .",
  "/wiki/Software_developer": "A computer programmer , sometimes called more recently a coder ( especially in more informal contexts ) , is a person who creates computer software . The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers , or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software . A programmer 's most oft-used computer language ( e.g. , Assembly , COBOL , C , C++ , C # , JavaScript , Lisp , Python ) may be prefixed to the term programmer . Some who work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with web . A range of occupations that involve programming also often require a range of other , similar skills , for example : ( software ) developer , web developer , mobile applications developer , embedded firmware developer , software engineer , computer scientist , game programmer , game developer and software analyst . The use of the term programmer as applied to these positions is sometimes considered an insulting simplification or even derogatory .",

  "/wiki/GPL": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/Linux": "Linux ( /\u02c8l\u026an\u0259ks/ ( listen ) LIN-\u0259ks ) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds . Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",

Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server .

  "/wiki/FreeBSD": "FreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , which was based on Research Unix . The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993 . In 2005 , FreeBSD was the most popular open-source BSD operating system , accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed BSD systems . FreeBSD has similarities with Linux , with two major differences in scope and licensing : FreeBSD maintains a complete system , i.e . the project delivers a kernel , device drivers , userland utilities , and documentation , as opposed to Linux only delivering a kernel and drivers , and relying on third-parties for system software ; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license , as opposed to the copyleft GPL used by Linux . The FreeBSD project includes a security team overseeing all software shipped in the base distribution . A wide range of additional third-party applications may be installed using the pkg package management system or FreeBSD Ports , or by compiling source code . Due to its licensing , much of FreeBSD 's codebase has become an integral part of other operating systems , such as Apple 's Darwin ( the basis for macOS , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS ) , FreeNAS ( an open-source NAS/SAN operating system ) , and the system software for Sony 's PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 .",

  "/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)": "Solaris is a non-free Unix operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems . It superseded the company 's earlier SunOS in 1993 . In 2010 , after the Sun acquisition by Oracle , it was renamed Oracle Solaris . Solaris is known for its scalability , especially on SPARC systems , and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace , ZFS and Time Slider . Solaris supports SPARC and x86-64 workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors . Solaris is registered as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification . Historically , Solaris was developed as proprietary software . In June 2005 , Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license , and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project . With OpenSolaris , Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software . After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010 , Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model . In August 2010 , Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel , effectively turning Solaris 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system . Following that , OpenSolaris was forked as illumos and is alive through several illumos distributions .",

  "/wiki/Unix": "Unix ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u026aks/ ; trademarked as UNIX ) is a family of multitasking , multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT & T Unix , development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , and others . Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows . Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system : almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language , thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms .",

Dillon started DragonFly in the belief that the techniques adopted for threading and symmetric multiprocessing in FreeBSD 5 would lead to poor performance and maintenance problems . He sought to correct these anticipated problems within the FreeBSD project . Due to conflicts with other FreeBSD developers over the implementation of his ideas , his ability to directly change the codebase was eventually revoked . Despite this , the DragonFly BSD and FreeBSD projects still work together , sharing bug fixes , driver updates , and other improvements . Intended as the logical continuation of the FreeBSD 4.x series , DragonFly has diverged significantly from FreeBSD , implementing lightweight kernel threads ( LWKT ) , an in-kernel message passing system , and the HAMMER file system .

He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy , along with his teacher , Socrates , and his most famous student , Aristotle . [ a ] Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality . The so-called Neoplatonism of philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry influenced Saint Augustine and thus Christianity . Alfred North Whitehead once noted : the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato . Plato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy . Plato is also considered the founder of Western political philosophy . His most famous contribution is the theory of Forms known by pure reason , in which Plato presents a solution to the problem of universals known as Platonism ( also ambiguously called either Platonic realism or Platonic idealism ) . He is also the namesake of Platonic love and the Platonic solids . His own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been along with Socrates , the pre-Socratics Pythagoras , Heraclitus and Parmenides , although few of his predecessors ' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from Plato himself . [ b ] Unlike the work of nearly all of his contemporaries , Plato 's entire body of work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years . Although their popularity has fluctuated over the years , the works of Plato have never been without readers since the time they were written .",

  "/wiki/Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
