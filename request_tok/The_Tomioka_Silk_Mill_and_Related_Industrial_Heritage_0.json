She is known for writing a memoir called the Tomioka Diary ( Tomioka Nikki ) in which she chronicled her life among the female workers in the Tomioka silk mill . She was among the daughters of samurai who were recruited in 1873 , the sixth year of the Meiji period , from across the nation for practical training over a period of two to three years in the silk production process . They later became trainers in silk manufacture in their own prefectures . Upon leaving Tomioka in 1874 , the government awarded Wada and her colleagues medals and the special title Women Spinners ' Victory Battalion . She became a trainer at the Saij\u014d Village Silk Reeling Factory ( later Rokk\u014dsha mill ) in Matsushiro , Nagano Prefecture . Wada married an army officer , who later died in 1913 from wounds he sustained in the Russo-Japanese war . She began composing the Tomioka Nikki while living at the Furukawa Mine company house at the Ashio Copper Mine , where her son was a manager . It was published after her death by him , leading some historians to doubt its authenticity .",

  "/wiki/Morus_(plant)": "Morus , a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae , comprises 10-16 species of deciduous trees commonly known as mulberries , growing wild and under cultivation in many temperate world regions . The closely related genus Broussonetia is also commonly known as mulberry , notably the paper mulberry , Broussonetia papyrifera . Mulberries are fast-growing when young , but soon become slow-growing and rarely exceed 10-15 m ( 30-50 ft ) tall . The leaves are alternately arranged , simple , and often lobed and serrated on the margin . Lobes are more common on juvenile shoots than on mature trees . [ citation needed ] The trees can be monoecious or dioecious . The mulberry fruit is a multiple , about 2-3 cm ( 3\u20444-1 1\u20444 in ) long . Immature fruits are white , green , or pale yellow . In most species , the fruit turns pink and then red while ripening , then dark purple or black , and has a strong and sweet flavor when fully ripe . The fruit of the Asian white-fruited cultivar is white when ripe , also sweet , and has a milder flavor . [ citation needed ] Although the darkest fruiting type are quite similar looking , mulberries are not to be confused with blackberries .",

  "/wiki/Silkworm": "Bombyx mori , the domestic silkmoth , is an insect from the moth family Bombycidae . It is the closest relative of Bombyx mandarina , the wild silkmoth . The silkworm is the larva or caterpillar of a silkmoth . It is an economically important insect , being a primary producer of silk . A silkworm 's preferred food is white mulberry leaves , though they may eat other mulberry species and even Osage orange . Domestic silkmoths are closely dependent on humans for reproduction , as a result of millennia of selective breeding . Wild silkmoths are different from their domestic cousins as they have not been selectively bred ; they are thus not as commercially viable in the production of silk . Sericulture , the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk , has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China , whence it spread to India , Korea , Japan , and the West . The domestic silkmoth was domesticated from the wild silkmoth Bombyx mandarina , which has a range from northern India to northern China , Korea , Japan , and the far eastern regions of Russia . The domestic silkmoth derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock . Silkmoths were unlikely to have been domestically bred before the Neolithic Age . Before then , the tools to manufacture quantities of silk thread had not been developed .",
