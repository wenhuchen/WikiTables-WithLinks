Its sheltered waters have played an important role in travel , trade and conflict throughout the centuries . Vikings anchored their longships in Scapa Flow more than a thousand years ago ; more recently , it was the United Kingdom 's chief naval base during the First and Second World Wars , though the facility was closed in 1956 . Scapa Flow has a shallow sandy bottom not deeper than 60 metres ( 200 ft ) and most of it is about 30 m ( 100 ft ) deep , and is one of the great natural harbours/anchorages of the world , with sufficient space to hold a number of navies . In 2013 , a consultation in ballast water management measured the commonly used Harbour Authority definition of Scapa Flow at 324.5 square kilometres ( 125.3 sq mi ) and just under 1 billion cubic metres of water . Since the scuttling of the German fleet after World War I , its wrecks and their marine habitats form an internationally acclaimed diving location . Scapa Flow hosts an oil port , the Flotta Oil Terminal . In good weather , its roadstead ( water of moderate conditions ) allows ship-to-ship transfers of crude oil product .

Orkney is 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of the coast of Caithness and has about 70 islands , of which 20 are inhabited . The largest island , Mainland , is often referred to as the Mainland , and has an area of 523 square kilometres ( 202 sq mi ) , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles . The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall . Orkney is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland , a constituency of the Scottish Parliament , a lieutenancy area , and a historic county . The local council is Orkney Islands Council , one of only three Councils in Scotland with a majority of elected members who are independents . [ Notes 2 ] The islands have been inhabited for at least 8,500 years , originally occupied by Mesolithic and Neolithic tribes and then by the Picts . Orkney was colonised and later annexed by Norway in 875 and settled by the Norse . The Scottish Parliament then absorbed the earldom to the Scottish Crown in 1472 , following the failed payment of a dowry for James III 's bride Margaret of Denmark . In addition to the Mainland , most of the remaining islands are in two groups , the North and South Isles , all of which have an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone . The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile , most of the land being farmed . Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy .",

Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization .

From 1940 to 1942 , while the Vichy regime was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine , the Germans and Italians militarily occupied northern and south-eastern France . While Paris remained the de jure capital of France , the government chose to relocate to the town of Vichy , 360 km ( 220 mi ) to the south in the zone libre , which thus became the de facto capital of the French State . Following the Allied landings in French North Africa in November 1942 , southern France was also militarily occupied by Germany and Italy to protect the Mediterranean coastline . Petain 's government remained in Vichy as the nominal government of France , albeit one that collaborated with Nazi Germany from November 1942 onwards . The government at Vichy remained there until late 1944 , when it lost its de facto authority due to the Allied invasion of France and the government was compelled to relocate to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany , where it continued to exist on paper until the end of hostilities in Europe . After being appointed Premier by President Albert Lebrun , Marshal P\u00e9tain 's cabinet agreed to end the war and signed an Armistice with Germany on 22 June 1940 .

  "/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis": "The Cuban Missile Crisis , also known as the October Crisis of 1962 ( Spanish : Crisis de Octubre ) , the Caribbean Crisis ( Russian : \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0441 , tr .

The confrontation is often considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale nuclear war . In response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961 and the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey , Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to Cuba 's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion . An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Fidel Castro in July 1962 , and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer . Meanwhile , the 1962 United States elections were under way , and the White House had for months denied charges that it was ignoring dangerous Soviet missiles 90 miles ( 140 km ) from Florida . The missile preparations were confirmed when an Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range ( SS-4 ) and intermediate-range ( R-14 ) ballistic missile facilities . The US established a naval blockade on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba ; Oval Office tapes during the crisis revealed that Kennedy had also put the blockade in place , as an attempt to provoke Soviet-backed forces in Berlin as well . The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union . After several days of tense negotiations , an agreement was reached between US President John F. Kennedy and Khrushchev . Publicly , the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union , subject to United Nations verification , in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again . Secretly , the United States agreed that it would dismantle all US-built Jupiter MRBMs , which had been deployed in Turkey against the Soviet Union ; there has been debate on whether or not Italy was included in the agreement as well .",
