Located in the inner-city area of Saint-Michel , it was founded in Baie-Saint-Paul on 16 June 1984 by former street performers Guy Lalibert\u00e9 and Gilles Ste-Croix . Originating as a performing troupe called Les \u00c9chassiers ( [ lez\u203fe.\u0283a.sje ] , The Waders ) , they toured Quebec in various forms between 1979 and 1983 . Their initial financial hardship was relieved in 1983 by a government grant from the Canada Council for the Arts to perform as part of the 450th anniversary celebrations of Jacques Cartier 's voyage to Canada . Their first official production Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success in 1984 , and after securing a second year of funding , Lalibert\u00e9 hired Guy Caron from the National Circus School to recreate it as a proper circus . Its theatrical , character-driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus ( nouveau cirque ) that it remains today . After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s , Nouvelle Exp\u00e9rience was created - with the direction of Franco Dragone - which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990 , but allowed it to create new shows . Cirque du Soleil expanded rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s , growing from one show to 19 shows in over 300 cities on every continent except Antarctica . The company employs 4,900 people from 50 countries and generates an annual revenue of approximately US $ 1 billion . The multiple permanent Las Vegas shows alone play to more than 9,000 people a night , 5% of the city 's visitors , adding to the over 100 million people who have seen Cirque du Soleil productions worldwide . In 2000 , Lalibert\u00e9 bought out Daniel Gauthier , and with 95% ownership continued to expand the brand . In 2008 , Lalibert\u00e9 split 20% of his share equally between the investment groups Istithmar World and Nakheel of Dubai in order to further finance the company 's goals .",
