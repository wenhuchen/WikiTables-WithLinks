Alcorn had posted a suicide note to her Tumblr blog , writing about societal standards affecting transgender people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination , abuse and lack of support for transgender people . Assigned male at birth , she was raised in Ohio by a family affiliated with the Churches of Christ movement . At age 14 , she came out as transgender to her parents , Carla and Doug Alcorn , who refused to accept her female gender identity . When she was 16 , they denied her request to undergo transition treatment , instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth . After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates , her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media . In her suicide note , Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings . She killed herself by walking into traffic on the Interstate 71 highway . Alcorn arranged for her suicide note to be posted online several hours after her death , and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media . LGBT rights activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems faced by transgender youth , while vigils were held in her memory in the United States and United Kingdom . Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of Leelah 's Law , a ban on conversion therapy in the U.S. , which received a supportive response from U.S. President Barack Obama .
