The son of the popular Roman general Germanicus and Augustus 's granddaughter Agrippina the Elder , Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire , conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty . Germanicus ' uncle and adoptive father , Tiberius , succeeded Augustus as emperor of Rome in 14 AD . Although he was born Gaius Caesar , after Julius Caesar , he acquired the nickname Caligula ( meaning little [ soldier 's ] boot , the diminutive form of caliga ) from his father 's soldiers during their campaign in Germania . When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19 , Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome , where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius . The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family , with Caligula as the sole male survivor . Untouched by the deadly intrigues , Caligula accepted an invitation in 31 to join the emperor on the island of Capri , where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier . Following the death of Tiberius , Caligula succeeded his adoptive grandfather as emperor in 37 AD . There are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula , although he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule . After this , the sources focus upon his cruelty , sadism , extravagance , and sexual perversion , presenting him as an insane tyrant . While the reliability of these sources is questionable , it is known that during his brief reign , Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor , as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate .

The character 's younger cousin , DCI John Barnaby ( played by Neil Dudgeon ) , took over his position when Nettles retired from the show in 2011 .

  "/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)": "ITV is a British free-to-air television network with its headquarters in London . It was launched in 1955 as Independent Television , under the auspices of the Independent Television Authority ( ITA ) ( later the Independent Broadcasting Authority , after the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972 , and currently Ofcom ) , to provide competition to BBC Television which had been established in 1932 . ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK . Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990 , its legal name has been Channel 3 , to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time , namely BBC 1 , BBC 2 and Channel 4 . In part , the number 3 was assigned because television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button , with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name . ITV is a network of television companies that operate regional television services and also share programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network . In recent years , several of these companies have merged , so currently the fifteen regional franchises are in the hands of two companies . The ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc , the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England , Wales , southern Scotland , the Isle of Man , the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland . With the exception of Northern Ireland , the ITV brand is the brand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas . In Northern Ireland , ITV plc uses the brand name UTV . STV Group plc uses the STV brand for its two franchises of central and northern Scotland .",
