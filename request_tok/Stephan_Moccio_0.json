  "/wiki/Harem": "Harem ( Arabic : \u062d\u0631\u064a\u0645 \u1e25ar\u012bm , a sacred inviolable place ; harem ; female members of the family ) , properly refers to domestic spaces that are reserved for the women of the house in a Muslim family . This private space has been traditionally understood as serving the purposes of maintaining the modesty , privilege , and protection of women . A harem may house a man 's wife - or wives and concubines , as in royal harems of the past - their pre-pubescent male children , unmarried daughters , female domestic workers , and other unmarried female relatives . In former times some harems were guarded by eunuchs who were allowed inside . The structure of the harem and the extent of monogamy or polygamy has varied depending on the family 's personalities , socio-economic status , and local customs . Similar institutions have been common in other Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilizations , especially among royal and upper-class families , and the term is sometimes used in other contexts . In traditional Persian residential architecture the women 's quarters were known as andaruni , and in the Indian subcontinent as zenana . Although the institution has experienced a sharp decline in the modern era due to a rise in education and economic opportunities for women , as well as Western influences , seclusion of women is still practiced in some parts of the world , such as rural Afghanistan and conservative states of the Gulf region . In the West , Orientalist imaginary conceptions of the harem as a hidden world of sexual subjugation where numerous women lounged in suggestive poses have influenced many paintings , stage productions , films and literary works . Some earlier European Renaissance paintings dating to the 16th century portray the women of the Ottoman harem as individuals of status and political significance . In many periods of Islamic history , women in the harem exercised various degrees of political power , such as the Sultanate of Women in the Ottoman Empire .",

An accompanying music video for Wrecking Ball was released on September 9 , 2013 .
