The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week .

The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 .

The following year , the Chiefs and the Bullies were joined by the New York Americans in a three-way race for the championship , with the Chiefs ' continuing inability to defeat the Bullies ( losing in Columbus and tying in Milwaukee ) led to Columbus repeating as AFL champions and Milwaukee finishing third . For the two years of the leagues existence , the Chiefs were a popular draw as they played in Wisconsins largest stadium . The AFL had accepted the 1941 entrance of a new Detroit team and deferred it until 1942 , but the Pearl Harbor attack and the subsequent U.S. entry into World War II put all plans for football to a halt . In September 1942 , league president William B. Cox announced the suspension of league activities until after the war , but the league - and the Chiefs - never returned .",
