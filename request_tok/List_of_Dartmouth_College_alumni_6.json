The team 's colors combine the Dodgers ' blue and the Giants ' orange . For the 1962 and 1963 seasons , the Mets played home games at the Polo Grounds . From 1964 to 2008 , their home ballpark was Shea Stadium . In 2009 , they moved into their current ballpark , Citi Field . In their inaugural season , the Mets posted a record of 40-120 , the worst regular season record since MLB went to a 162-game schedule . The team never finished better than second-to-last until the Miracle Mets beat the Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 World Series , one of the biggest upsets in World Series history . Since then , they have played in four World Series , including a dramatic run in 1973 that ended in a seven-game loss to the Oakland Athletics , a second championship in 1986 over the Boston Red Sox , a Subway Series loss against their cross-town rivals the New York Yankees in 2000 , and a five-game loss to the Kansas City Royals in 2015 .

Founded in 1900 through a donation made by Dartmouth alumnus Edward Tuck , the Tuck School was the first institution in the world to offer a master 's degree in business administration . The Tuck School awards only one degree , the Master of Business Administration degree , through a full-time , residential program . The school does not offer an Executive MBA or a part-time program , believing that such programs , while lucrative , would dilute the focus of its full-time MBA program . Tuck does , however , offer an Advanced Management Program for executives , which spans either one or two weeks depending on the course . In addition , Tuck offers a 4-week , intensive summer program to liberal arts students seeking to build a foundation in core business concepts . Within Dartmouth , faculty from Tuck and The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice are partnering to offer a Master of Health Care Delivery Science degree from Dartmouth College . Moreover , Tuck partners with the Thayer School of Engineering to teach management courses through a Master of Engineering Management program offered by Thayer School of Engineering . Compared to other elite business schools , Tuck is known for its rural setting and small class size - each MBA class consists of about 280 students . As such , both factors , combined with Tuck 's commitment to the full-time MBA program attribute to its high giving rate among the 10,300 Tuck alumni across 73 countries . Almost 70% of all Tuck alumni regularly give to the school , the highest rate among business schools worldwide . The MBA program has held a top-10 ranking in multiple publications , including U.S. News & World Report , Bloomberg , The Economist , Forbes , Business Insider , and Vault .",

  "/wiki/Private_equity": "Private equity ( PE ) typically refers to investment funds , generally organized as limited partnerships , that buy and restructure companies that are not publicly traded . Private equity is , strictly speaking , a type of equity and one of the asset classes consisting of equity securities and debt in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange . However , the term has come to be used to describe the business of taking a company into private ownership in order to restructure it before selling it again at a hoped-for profit . A private equity investment will generally be made by a private equity firm , a venture capital firm or an angel investor . Each of these categories of investors has its own set of goals , preferences and investment strategies ; however , all provide working capital to a target company to nurture expansion , new-product development , or restructuring of the company 's operations , management , or ownership . Bloomberg Businessweek has called private equity a rebranding of leveraged-buyout firms after the 1980s . Common investment strategies in private equity include leveraged buyouts , venture capital , growth capital , distressed investments and mezzanine capital . In a typical leveraged-buyout transaction , a private-equity firm buys majority control of an existing or mature firm . This is distinct from a venture-capital or growth-capital investment , in which the investors ( typically venture-capital firms or angel investors ) invest in young , growing or emerging companies , and rarely obtain majority control .

  "/wiki/Venture_capital": "Venture capital ( VC ) is a type of financing that is provided by firms or funds to small , early-stage , emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential , or which have demonstrated high growth ( in terms of number of employees , annual revenue , or both ) . Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity , or an ownership stake , in those companies . Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky start-ups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful . Because startups face high uncertainty , VC investments have high rates of failure . The start-ups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries , such as information technology ( IT ) , clean technology or biotechnology . The typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial seed funding round . The first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the Series A round . Venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual exit event , such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering ( IPO ) or doing a merger and acquisition ( also known as a trade sale ) of the company . Alternatively , an exit may come about via the private equity secondary market . In addition to angel investing , equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options , venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering . In exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and early-stage companies , venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions , in addition to a significant portion of the companies ' ownership ( and consequently value ) . Start-ups like Uber , Airbnb , Flipkart , Xiaomi & Didi Chuxing are highly valued startups , commonly known as unicorns , where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these early-stage firms ; they also often provide strategic advice to the firm 's executives on its business model and marketing strategies .",
