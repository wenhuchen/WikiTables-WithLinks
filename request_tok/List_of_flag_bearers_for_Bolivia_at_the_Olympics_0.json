Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance . 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began . Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system . There have been arguments ( mostly in popular media ) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis , however , there is little or no evidence for such a correlation . The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success , with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world .",

The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other . The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements , but the rest of the costs for the Games had to be privately financed . Consequently , the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding . Thirty-two nations - the largest number of countries participating in the Winter Olympics until then - competed in the four sports and twenty-four events . Austrian Toni Sailer became the first person to sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics . The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games . Logistically , the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events . To remedy this , the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered . Politics did not affect the 1956 Winter Games - unlike the Summer Games in Melbourne , Australia later in the year which many nations boycotted after the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution , and the Suez War . The Cortina Olympics were the first Winter Olympics televised to a multi-national audience .",

  "/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics": "The 1936 Summer Olympics ( German : Olympische Sommerspiele 1936 ) , officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event held in 1936 in Berlin , Nazi Germany . Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona , Spain , on 26 April 1931 , at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona . It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games . To outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932 , Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler had a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium built , as well as six gymnasiums and many other smaller arenas . The games were the first to be televised , and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries . Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $ 7 million . Her film , titled Olympia , pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports . Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism , and the official Nazi party paper , the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter , wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games . German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods , although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club , Hakoah Vienna , did take part . Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime . Total ticket revenues were 7.5 million Reichsmark , generating a profit of over one million \u211b\u2133 . The official budget did not include outlays by the city of Berlin ( which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 16.5 million \u211b\u2133 ) or outlays of the German national government ( which did not make its costs public , but is estimated to have spent US $ 30 million ) .",
