Herne Bay 's seafront is home to the world 's first freestanding purpose-built Clock Tower , built in 1837 ; from the late Victorian period until 1978 , the town had the second-longest pier in the United Kingdom . The town began as a small shipping community , receiving goods and passengers from London en route to Canterbury and Dover . The town rose to prominence as a seaside resort during the early 19th century after the building of a pleasure pier and promenade by a group of London investors , and reached its heyday in the late Victorian era . Its popularity as a holiday destination has declined over the past decades , due to the increase in foreign travel and to a lesser degree exposure to flooding that has prevented the town 's redevelopment .",

  "/wiki/Weimar_Republic": "The Weimar Republic ( German : Weimarer Republik [ \u02c8va\u026ama\u0281\u0250 \u0281epu\u02c8bli\u02d0k ] ( listen ) ) is an unofficial historical designation for the German state from 1918 to 1933 . The name derives from the city of Weimar , where its constitutional assembly first took place . The official name of the republic remained Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) unchanged from 1871 , because of the German tradition of substates . Although commonly translated as German Empire , the word Reich here better translates as realm , in that the term does not necessarily have monarchical connotations in itself . The Reich was changed from a constitutional monarchy into a republic . In English , the country was usually known simply as Germany . Germany became a de facto republic on 9 November 1918 when Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son Crown Prince Wilhelm , and became a de jure republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created . A national assembly was convened in Weimar , where a new constitution for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919 . In its fourteen years , the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems , including hyperinflation , political extremism ( with contending paramilitaries ) as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War . Resentment in Germany towards the Treaty of Versailles was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty . The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations ( by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan ) . Under the Locarno Treaties , Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning irredentist claims on France and Belgium , but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade Austria to join Germany as one of Germany 's states .",
