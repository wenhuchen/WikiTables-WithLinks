  "/wiki/Queen's_Beasts": "The Queen 's Beasts are ten heraldic statues representing the genealogy of Queen Elizabeth II , depicted as the Royal supporters of England . They stood in front of the temporary western annexe to Westminster Abbey for the Queen 's coronation in 1953 . Each of The Queen 's Beasts consists of an heraldic beast supporting a shield bearing a badge or arms of a family associated with the ancestry of Queen Elizabeth II . They were commissioned by the British Ministry of Works from sculptor James Woodford ( who was paid the sum of \u00a32,750 for the work ) . They were uncoloured except for their shields at the coronation . They are now on display in the Canadian Museum of History . There are other statues of the Queen 's Beasts , sometimes referred to as the King 's Beasts , at Hampton Court Palace and Kew Gardens in London , and on the roof of St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle .",
  "/wiki/Palm_House": "A palm house is a greenhouse that is specialized for the growing of palms and other tropical and subtropical plants . Palm houses required constant heat for plants and were built as status symbols in Victorian Britain . Several examples of these ornate glass and iron structures can still be found in significant parks such as Liverpool 's Sefton Park and Stanley Park . One of the earliest examples of a palm house is located in the Belfast Botanic Gardens . Designed by Charles Lanyon , the building was completed in 1840 . It was constructed by iron-maker and iron-founder Richard Turner , who would later also build the Palm House at Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew Kew . The latter , designed by Decimus Burton and Nicole Burton , was the first large-scale structural use of wrought iron and was built between 1844 and 1848 . There has been discussion of who began the design process of the Palm House , though a review of the Botanic Garden records and letters shows that iron-founder , Richard Turner , was primarily involved in its design . Who made the Palm House ? Sir William Jackson Hooker was appointed Director of the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew in 1841 . He had many plans to improve the Royal Gardens , one of which was a new Palm House . Decimus Burton was asked to draw up preliminary sketches in 1844 for him to review .",
