With a population of 4,007,526 , Amman is the largest city in the Levant region and the fifth-largest city in the Arab world . It is considered to be among the most modernized Arab cities and a major tourist destination . The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman is in a Neolithic site known as 'Ain Ghazal , where some of the oldest human statues ever found dating to 7250 BC were uncovered . During the Iron Age , the city was known as Ammon , home to the Kingdom of the Ammonites . It was named Philadelphia during its Greek and Roman periods , and was finally called Amman during the Islamic period . Abandoned for much of the medieval and post-medieval period , modern Amman dates to the late 19th century when Circassian immigrants were settled there by the Ottoman Empire in 1867 . The first municipal council was established in 1909 . Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan 's capital in 1921 , and after several successive waves of refugees : Palestinians in 1948 and 1967 ; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003 ; and Syrians since 2011 . It was initially built on seven hills but now spans over 19 hills combining 27 districts , which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality headed by its mayor Yousef Shawarbeh . Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills ( Jabal ) or the valleys ( Wadi ) they occupy , such as Jabal Lweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun . East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities , while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city .",
