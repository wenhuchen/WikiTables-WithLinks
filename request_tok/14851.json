In 1989 , they were renamed The BRIT Awards . Mastercard has been the long-term sponsor of the event . The highest profile music awards ceremony in the UK , the BRIT Awards have featured some of the most notable events in British popular culture , such as the final public appearance of Freddie Mercury , the Jarvis Cocker protest against Michael Jackson , the height of a high-profile feud between Oasis and fellow Britpop band Blur , the Union Jack dress worn by Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls , and a Chumbawamba member throwing a bucket of iced water over then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott . These moments took place in the 1990s when the ceremony had a reputation for being a little shambolic , unpredictable and , at times , anarchic with a criticism it has lost its edge since then and evolved into a more polished , sanitised affair .
