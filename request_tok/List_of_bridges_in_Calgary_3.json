It is awarded for valour in the presence of the enemy to members of the British Armed Forces . It may be awarded posthumously .

It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879 . Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857 , two-thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch . These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace . The VC was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War . Since then , the medal has been awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 individual recipients . Only 15 medals , of which 11 were to members of the British Army and four were to members of the Australian Army , have been awarded since the Second World War .

In 2008 , the Calgary Stampede was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame . The event 's roots are traced to 1886 when the Calgary and District Agricultural Society held its first fair . In 1912 , American promoter Guy Weadick organized his first rodeo and festival , known as the Stampede . He returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour of soldiers returning from World War I. Weadick 's festival became an annual event in 1923 when it merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede . Organized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders , the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world 's richest rodeos , one of Canada 's largest festivals , and a significant tourist attraction for the city . Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada . However , both have been the target of increasing international criticism by animal welfare groups and politicians concerned about particular events as well as animal rights organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general .
