  "/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn": "Katharine Houghton Hepburn ( May 12 , 1907 - June 29 , 2003 ) was an American actress who was a leading lady in Hollywood for more than 60 years . She appeared in a range of genres , from screwball comedy to literary drama , and she received a record ( for any gender ) four Academy Awards for Lead Acting Performances , plus eight further nominations . In 1999 , Hepburn was named by the American Film Institute the greatest female star of Classic Hollywood Cinema . She was known for her fierce independence and spirited personality . Raised in Connecticut by wealthy , progressive parents , Hepburn began to act while studying at Bryn Mawr College . Favorable reviews of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood . Her early years in film were marked with success , including an Academy Award for Best Actress for her third picture , Morning Glory ( 1933 ) , but this was followed by a series of commercial failures culminating in the critically lauded but commercially unsuccessful comedy Bringing Up Baby ( 1938 ) , a pairing with Cary Grant . Hepburn masterminded her own comeback , buying out her contract with RKO Radio Pictures and acquiring the film rights to The Philadelphia Story , which she sold on the condition that she be the star . That comedy film , again co-starring Cary Grant , was a box office success and landed her a third Academy Award nomination , plus won her other co-star , James Stewart , his only Academy Award . Both movies are now considered among the greatest comedy films . In the 1940s , she began focusing on a screen and romantic partnership with Spencer Tracy , which spanned 26 years and nine movies , although the romance with the married Tracy was hidden from the public . The partnership began with Woman of the Year ( 1942 ) , continued with Adam 's Rib ( 1949 ) , both being battle of the sexes romantic comedies , and concluded with the race-issue drama Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner ( 1967 ) , also starring Sidney Poitier ; Tracy died shortly after the movie 's filming .",

The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a scandal in the U.S. that forced her to remain in Europe for several years , during which she starred in Rossellini 's Journey to Italy ( 1954 ) , now critically acclaimed . She made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in Anastasia ( 1956 ) , winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress .

This 1944 version was directed by George Cukor and starred Ingrid Bergman , Charles Boyer , Joseph Cotten , and 18-year-old Angela Lansbury in an Oscar-nominated screen debut ( Supporting Actress ) . Gaslight had a larger scale and budget than the earlier film , and lends a different feel to the material . To avoid confusion with the first film , this version was originally given the title The Murder in Thornton Square in the UK . This film features numerous deviations from the original stage play , though the central drama remains , of a husband trying to drive his wife insane in order to distract her from his criminal activities .

  "/wiki/Anastasia_(1956_film)": "Anastasia is a 1956 American historical drama film directed by Anatole Litvak and written by Arthur Laurents . Set in interwar France , the film follows the story of a suicidal amnesiac ( Ingrid Bergman ) , whose remarkable resemblance to the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia - the youngest daughter of the late Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna , who is rumored to have survived the execution of her family - draws her into a plot devised by the former Russian White General Bounine ( Yul Brynner ) and his associates to swindle from the Grand Duchess an inheritance of \u00a310 million . However , the ultimate hurdle to their plan is the exiled Russian aristocracy - in particular the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna ( Helen Hayes ) - whom their handpicked claimant must convince of her legitimacy if they wish for their scheme to succeed . The origins of Anastasia lie in a play written by Marcelle Maurette , which was in turn inspired by Anna Anderson , the most famous of the many Anastasia impostors who appeared after the death of the Imperial family in July 1918 .",
  "/wiki/29th_Academy_Awards": "During the 29th Academy Awards , the regular competitive category of Best Foreign Language Film was introduced , instead of only being recognized as a Special Achievement Award or as a Best Picture nominee ( as in 1938 ) . The first winner in this new category was Federico Fellini 's La Strada with Anthony Quinn and a second nomination for Best Original Screenplay . Its win would help spur an interest in foreign-language films . Another Fellini film , Nights of Cabiria would win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in the following year . This was also the first year that all of the five Best Picture nominees were in color . It was also the first Oscar telecast to be videotaped for later broadcast , especially for those network affiliates that did n't want to broadcast the event live . All of the major awards winners were large-scale epics - Mike Todd 's Around the World in 80 Days , The King and I , Anastasia , George Stevens ' Giant , Cecil B. DeMille 's The Ten Commandments ( the highest-grossing film of the year ) , King Vidor 's War and Peace and William Wyler 's Friendly Persuasion . And the trend toward blockbusters and colorful spectaculars was established for years to come , with The Bridge on the River Kwai , Gigi , and Ben-Hur being subsequent Best Picture champions . The Best Original Story category had two interesting quirks this year . First , the Oscar for Best Original Story for The Brave One was awarded to Robert Rich , a pseudonym of Dalton Trumbo , who was blacklisted at the time and thus unable to receive credit under his own name . Second , Edward Bernds and Elwood Ullman withdrew their names from consideration in this category for their work on High Society , as the nomination had been intended for the musical starring Grace Kelly , while Bernds and Ullman had instead written a Bowery Boys film of the same name . In fact , the nomination was a double mistake , as High Society was based on the play and film The Philadelphia Story and probably would not have qualified as an original story anyway .",

His ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his natural and authentic appearance on screen . Throughout his career , he sustained a screen persona that represented the ideal American hero . Cooper began his career as a film extra and stunt rider , but soon landed acting roles . After establishing himself as a Western hero in his early silent films , he appeared as the Virginian and became a movie star in 1929 with his first sound picture , The Virginian . In the early 1930s , he expanded his heroic image to include more cautious characters in adventure films and dramas such as A Farewell to Arms ( 1932 ) and The Lives of a Bengal Lancer ( 1935 ) . During the height of his career , Cooper portrayed a new type of hero - a champion of the common man - in films such as Mr . Deeds Goes to Town ( 1936 ) , Meet John Doe ( 1941 ) , Sergeant York ( 1941 ) , The Pride of the Yankees ( 1942 ) , and For Whom the Bell Tolls ( 1943 ) . In the postwar years , he portrayed more mature characters at odds with the world in films such as The Fountainhead ( 1949 ) and High Noon ( 1952 ) .",
  "/wiki/Sergeant_York_(film)": "Sergeant York is a 1941 American biographical film about the life of Alvin York , one of the most-decorated American soldiers of World War I . It was directed by Howard Hawks and was the highest-grossing film of the year . The film was based on the diary of Sergeant Alvin York , as edited by Tom Skeyhill , and adapted by Harry Chandlee , Abem Finkel , John Huston , Howard E. Koch , and Sam Cowan ( uncredited ) . York refused , several times , to authorize a film version of his life story , but finally yielded to persistent efforts in order to finance the creation of an interdenominational Bible school . The story that York insisted on Gary Cooper for the title role derives from the fact that producer Jesse L. Lasky recruited Cooper by writing a plea that he accept the role and then signed York 's name to the telegram . Cooper went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal . The film also won for Best Film Editing and was nominated in nine other categories , including Best Picture , Director ( Hawks ) , Supporting Actor ( Walter Brennan ) , and Supporting Actress ( Margaret Wycherly ) . The American Film Institute ranked the film 57th in the its 100 most inspirational American movies . It also rated Alvin York 35th in its list of the top 50 heroes in American cinema . In 2008 , Sergeant York was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant .",
  "/wiki/14th_Academy_Awards": "The 14th Academy Awards honored film achievements in 1941 and was held in the Biltmore Bowl at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles , California . The ceremony is now considered notable , in retrospect , as the year in which Citizen Kane failed to win Best Picture , which instead was awarded to John Ford 's How Green Was My Valley . Ford won his third award for Best Director , becoming the second to accomplish three wins in that category , and the first to win in consecutive years ( having won for The Grapes of Wrath the previous year ) . Most public attention was focused on the Best Actress race between sibling rivals Joan Fontaine in Alfred Hitchcocks Suspicion and Olivia de Havilland for Hold Back the Dawn . Fontaines victory was the only time a performer won for a role in a Hitchcock film . This was also the first year in which documentaries were included . The first Oscar for a documentary was awarded to Churchill 's Island . The Little Foxes established a new high of nine nominations without winning a single Oscar . Its mark was matched by Peyton Place in 1957 , and exceeded by The Turning Point and The Color Purple , both of which received 11 nominations without a win . Citizen Kane , often later designated as the greatest film ever made in a number of polls , was nominated for nine Academy Awards , including Best Picture , but won only one , for Best Original Screenplay . A portion of the ceremony was broadcast by CBS Radio .",

Though mired in controversy with political overtones at the time of its release , the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four ( Actor , Editing , Music-Score , and Music-Song ) as well as four Golden Globe Awards ( Actor , Supporting Actress , Score , and Cinematography-Black and White ) . The award-winning score was written by Russian-born composer Dimitri Tiomkin . High Noon was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant in 1989 , the NFR 's first year of existence . An iconic film whose story has been partly or completely repeated in later film productions , the ending scenes especially inspired a next-to-endless number of later films , including but not just limited to westerns .",
  "/wiki/25th_Academy_Awards": "The 25th Academy Awards ceremony was held on March 19 , 1953 . It took place at the RKO Pantages Theatre in Hollywood , and the NBC International Theatre in New York City . It was the first Academy Awards ceremony to be televised , and the first ceremony to be held in Hollywood and New York City simultaneously . It was also the only year that the New York ceremonies were to be held in the NBC International Theatre on Columbus Circle , which was shortly thereafter demolished and replaced by the New York Coliseum convention center . A major upset occurred when the heavily favored High Noon lost to Cecil B. DeMille 's The Greatest Show on Earth , eventually considered among the worst films to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture . The American film magazine Premiere listed the film among the 10 worst Oscar winners and the British film magazine Empire rated it # 3 on their list of the 10 worst Oscar winners . It has the lowest spot on Rotten Tomatoes ' list of the 81 films to win Best Picture . Of all the films nominated for the Oscar this year , only High Noon , and Singin ' in the Rain would show up 46 years later on the American Film Institute list of the greatest American films of the 20th Century . For a film that only received two nominations , Singin ' in the Rain went on to be named as the greatest American musical film of all time and in the 2007 American Film Institute updated list as the fifth greatest American film of all time , while High Noon was ranked twenty-seventh on the same 2007 list , as well . The Bad and the Beautiful won five awards , the most wins ever for a film not nominated for Best Picture . It was also the second Academy Awards in which a film not nominated for Best Picture received the most awards of the evening , excluding years where there were ties for the most wins . The only other film to do this was The Thief of Bagdad at the 13th Academy Awards ; as of the 91st Academy Awards , it has not happened since ."
