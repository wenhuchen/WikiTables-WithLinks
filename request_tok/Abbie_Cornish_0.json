As Fanny Brawne , she met Keats , who was her neighbour in Hampstead , at the beginning of his brief period of intense creative activity in 1818 . Although his first written impressions of Brawne were quite critical , his imagination seems to have turned her into the goddess-figure he needed to worship , as expressed in Endymion , and scholars have acknowledged her as his muse . They became secretly engaged in October 1819 , but Keats soon discovered that he was suffering from tuberculosis . His condition limited their opportunities to meet , but their correspondence revealed passionate devotion . In September 1820 , he left for the warmer climate of Rome , and her mother agreed to their marrying on his projected return , but he died there in February 1821 , aged twenty-five . Brawne drew consolation from her continuing friendship with Keats ' younger sister , who was also called Fanny . Brawne later married and bore three children , whom she entrusted with the intimate letters Keats had written to her . When these were published in 1878 , it was the first time the public had heard of Brawne , and they aroused interest among literary scholars . But they attracted much venom from the press , which declared her to have been unworthy of such a distinguished figure . By contrast , the later publication of Brawnes letters to Fanny Keats showed her in a more favourable light , greatly improving her reputation .",
