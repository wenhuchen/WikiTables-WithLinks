  "uid": "All_Star_Mr_&_Mrs_7",
  "intro": "All Star Mr & Mrs is a British television show which first began airing on 12 April 2008 on ITV. It is a celebrity revival of the original Mr and Mrs that aired on ITV from 1968 to 1988 with two separate revivals in 1995-1996 and 1999 and was also based on the Canadian game show of the same name. The programme is hosted by Phillip Schofield, although Fern Britton had co-hosted the show with Schofield between 2008-10. The show features celebrities and their real-life partners playing to win up to \u00a330,000 for their chosen charity. On 13 August 2017, it was reported that the series was to be rested for a year, with ITV taking the series off their TV schedule for 2017. It was also rumored that the show could be axed all together. ITV has yet to comment on the show's status, but with the show being taken off TV show audience websites, there will not be a series in 2017."
