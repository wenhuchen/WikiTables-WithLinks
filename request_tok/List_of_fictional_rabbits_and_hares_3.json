The series was based/inspired on the Looney Tunes cartoon characters , with the series described by Warner Bros. as an action-comedy . Loonatics Unleashed is meant to be a mixture of the Looney Tunes shorts ' irreverent style of humor and a modern action animated series , with the characters designed in a more action cartoon inspired style . Unlike previous Looney Tunes-related shows , Loonatics Unleashed has a darker tone and takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting , as well as multiple minor story arcs . The initial concept designs were met with a huge wave of criticism among fans and there were petitions to have the designs changed . Warner Bros. themselves have since considered this show to be a failure as well as an embarrassment .

  "/wiki/Animated_cartoon": "The history of animation started long before the development of cinematography . Humans have probably attempted to depict motion as far back as the paleolithic period . Much later , shadow play and the magic lantern ( since circa 1659 ) offered popular shows with projected images on a screen , moving as the result of manipulation by hand and/or minor mechanics . In 1833 , the stroboscopic disc ( better known as the phenakistiscope ) introduced the stroboscopic principles of modern animation , which decades later would also provide the basis for cinematography . Between 1895 and 1920 , during the rise of the cinematic industry , several different animation techniques were developed , including stop-motion with objects , puppets , clay or cutouts , and drawn or painted animation . Hand-drawn animation , mostly animation painted on cels , was the dominant technique throughout most of the 20th century and became known as traditional animation . Around the turn of the millennium , computer animation became the dominant technique . Computer animation is mostly associated with a three-dimensional appearance with detailed shading , although many different animation styles have been generated or simulated with computers . In practice , computer animation with a relatively two-dimensional appearance , stark outlines and less shading , will generally be considered traditional animation . For instance , the first feature movie made on computers , without a camera , is The Rescuers Down Under ( 1990 ) , but its style can hardly be distinguished from cel animation . This article details the history of animation which looks like drawn or painted animation , regardless of the underlying technique .",
