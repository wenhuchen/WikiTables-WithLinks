  "/wiki/1951_Pan_American_Games": "The 1951 Pan American Games ( the I Pan American Games ) were held in Buenos Aires , Argentina between February 25 and March 9 , 1951 . The Pan American Games ' origins were at the Games of the X Olympiad in Los Angeles , United States , where officials representing the National Olympic Committees of the Americas discussed the staging of an Olympic-style regional athletic competition for the athletes of the Americas . During the Pan-American Exposition at Dallas in 1937 , a limited sports program was staged . These included Athletics , Boxing , and Wrestling among others . This program was considered a success and a meeting of Olympic officials from the Americas was held . At the Pan American Sports Conference held in 1940 , it was decided to hold the 1st Pan American Games at Buenos Aires , Argentina , in 1942 . The Pan American Sports Committee was formed to govern the games . Avery Brundage was elected as the first President . However , the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought much of the Americas into World War II , thus forcing the cancellation of the 1942 games . A second conference was held in 1948 . Avery Brundage was re-elected as the President of the PASC . It was decided that Buenos Aires would still host the 1st Pan American Games , this time in 1951 .",

The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata , on the South American continent 's southeastern coast . Buenos Aires can be translated as fair winds or good airs , but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century , by the use of the original name Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre , named after the Madonna of Bonaria in Sardinia . The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation , which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts , constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas , with a population of around 15.6 million . The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province 's capital ; rather , it is an autonomous district . In 1880 , after decades of political infighting , Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province . The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores ; both are now neighborhoods of the city . The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy , hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ( Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires ; CABA ) . Its citizens first elected a chief of government ( i.e . mayor ) in 1996 ; previously , the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic . Buenos Aires ' quality of life was ranked 91st in the world in 2018 , being one of the best in Latin America . In 2012 , it was the most visited city in South America , and the second-most visited city of Latin America ( behind Mexico City ) .",
