  "/wiki/SOAP": "SOAP ( abbreviation for Simple Object Access Protocol ) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks . Its purpose is to provide extensibility , neutrality , verbosity and independence . It uses XML Information Set for its message format , and relies on application layer protocols , most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) , although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) , for message negotiation and transmission . SOAP allows developers to invoke processes running on disparate operating systems ( such as Windows , macOS , and Linux ) to authenticate , authorize , and communicate using Extensible Markup Language ( XML ) . Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all operating systems , SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and receive responses independent of language and platforms .",

  "/wiki/REST": "Representational state transfer ( REST ) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services . Web services that conform to the REST architectural style , called RESTful Web services , provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet . RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations . Other kinds of Web services , such as SOAP Web services , expose their own arbitrary sets of operations . Web resources were first defined on the World Wide Web as documents or files identified by their URLs . However , today they have a much more generic and abstract definition that encompasses every thing or entity that can be identified , named , addressed , or handled , in any way whatsoever , on the Web . In a RESTful Web service , requests made to a resource 's URI will elicit a response with a payload formatted in HTML , XML , JSON , or some other format . The response can confirm that some alteration has been made to the stored resource , and the response can provide hypertext links to other related resources or collections of resources . When HTTP is used , as is most common , the operations ( HTTP methods ) available are GET , HEAD , POST , PUT , PATCH , DELETE , CONNECT , OPTIONS and TRACE . By using a stateless protocol and standard operations , RESTful systems aim for fast performance , reliability , and the ability to grow by reusing components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole , even while it is running . The term representational state transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation . Fielding 's dissertation explained the REST principles that were known as the HTTP object model beginning in 1994 , and were used in designing the HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) standards .",

  "/wiki/PHP": "PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development . It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 ; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group . PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page , but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor . PHP code may be executed with a command line interface ( CLI ) , embedded into HTML code , or used in combination with various web template systems , web content management systems , and web frameworks . PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) executable . The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code , which may be any type of data , such as generated HTML code or binary image data . PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context , such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control . The standard PHP interpreter , powered by the Zend Engine , is free software released under the PHP License . PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform , free of charge . The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014 , with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow . Since 2014 , work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification . As of February 2020 [ update ] , over half of sites on the web using PHP are still on discontinued/EOLed version 5.6 or older ; and over 55% of all websites in the world run versions prior to 7.2 , that are neither officially supported by The PHP Development Team , while security support is provided by third parties , such as Debian ( up to June 2020 for PHP 5 ) .",

Many applications are both clients and servers , as commonly seen in distributed computing . IPC is very important to the design process for microkernels and nanokernels , which reduce the number of functionalities provided by the kernel . Those functionalities are then obtained by communicating with servers via IPC , leading to a large increase in communication when compared to a regular monolithic kernel . IPC interfaces generally encompass variable analytic framework structures . These processes ensure compatibility between the multi-vector protocols upon which IPC models rely . An IPC mechanism is either synchronous or asynchronous . Synchronization primitives may be used to have synchronous behavior with an asynchronous IPC mechanism .",
  "/wiki/Peer-to-peer": "Peer-to-peer ( P2P ) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers . Peers are equally privileged , equipotent participants in the application . They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes . Peers make a portion of their resources , such as processing power , disk storage or network bandwidth , directly available to other network participants , without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts . Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources , in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided . Emerging collaborative P2P systems are going beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources , and are looking for diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a virtual community thereby empowering it to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers , yet that are beneficial to all the peers . While P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains , the architecture was popularized by the file sharing system Napster , originally released in 1999 . The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction . In such social contexts , peer-to-peer as a meme refers to the egalitarian social networking that has emerged throughout society , enabled by Internet technologies in general .",
  "/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol": "The Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite . It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol ( IP ) . Therefore , the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP . TCP provides reliable , ordered , and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets ( bytes ) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network . Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web , email , remote administration , and file transfer rely on TCP , which is part of the Transport Layer of the TCP/IP suite . SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP . TCP is connection-oriented , and a connection between client and server is established ( passive open ) before data can be sent . Three-way handshake ( active open ) , retransmission , and error-detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency . Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) , which provides a connectionless datagram service that prioritizes time over reliability . TCP employs network congestion avoidance . However , there are vulnerabilities to TCP including denial of service , connection hijacking , TCP veto , and reset attack . For network security , monitoring , and debugging , TCP traffic can be intercepted and logged with a packet sniffer .",
  "/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol": "In computer networking , the User Datagram Protocol no-repeat ; background-position : right .1em center } . UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms . UDP provides checksums for data integrity , and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram . It has no handshaking dialogues , and thus exposes the user 's program to any unreliability of the underlying network ; there is no guarantee of delivery , ordering , or duplicate protection . If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level , an application may use Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol ( SCTP ) which are designed for this purpose . UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application ; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack . Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission , which may not be an option in a real-time system .",
  "/wiki/WebSocket": "WebSocket is a computer communications protocol , providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection . The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011 , and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C . WebSocket is distinct from HTTP . Both protocols are located at layer 7 in the OSI model and depend on TCP at layer 4 . Although they are different , RFC 6455 states that WebSocket is designed to work over HTTP ports 80 and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries , thus making it compatible with the HTTP protocol . To achieve compatibility , the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol . The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser ( or other client application ) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling , facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server . This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client , and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open . In this way , a two-way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server . The communications are done over TCP port number 80 ( or 443 in the case of TLS-encrypted connections ) , which is of benefit for those environments which block non-web Internet connections using a firewall . Similar two-way browser-server communications have been achieved in non-standardized ways using stopgap technologies such as Comet . Most browsers support the protocol , including Google Chrome , Microsoft Edge , Internet Explorer , Firefox , Safari and Opera .",
