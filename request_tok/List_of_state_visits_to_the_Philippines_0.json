Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo ; the remainder of the island 's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and Indonesia . Brunei 's population was 428,963 in 2018 . At the peak of the Bruneian Empire , Sultan Bolkiah ( reigned 1485-1528 ) is alleged to have had control over most regions of Borneo , including modern-day Sarawak and Sabah , as well as the Sulu Archipelago off the northeast tip of Borneo , Seludong ( modern-day Manila ) , and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo . The maritime state was visited by Spain 's Magellan Expedition in 1521 and fought against Spain in the 1578 Castilian War . During the 19th century , the Bruneian Empire began to decline . The Sultanate ceded Sarawak ( Kuching ) to James Brooke and installed him as the White Rajah , and it ceded Sabah to the British North Borneo Chartered Company . In 1888 , Brunei became a British protectorate and was assigned a British resident as colonial manager in 1906 . After the Japanese occupation during World War II , in 1959 a new constitution was written . In 1962 , a small armed rebellion against the monarchy was ended with the help of the British .",

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",

Under the country 's constitution , the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited power . However , since 1993 , as a matter of convention , the presidency has been held simultaneously by the general secretary of the Communist Party of China , the top leader in the one party system . The presidency is officially regarded as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post ; theoretically , the president serves at the pleasure of the National People 's Congress , the legislature , and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative . [ note 1 ] The current president is Xi Jinping , who took office in March 2013 . Since 1993 , apart from brief periods of transition , the top leader of China simultaneously serves as the president , the leader of the party ( as General Secretary ) , and the commander-in-chief of the military ( as the chairman of the Central Military Commission ) . This individual then carries out different duties under separate titles . For example , the leader meets foreign dignitaries and receives ambassadors in his capacity as President , issues military directives as Chairman of the Central Military Commission , and upholds party rule as the general secretary of the Communist Party of China . The presidency was first established in the Constitution of the People 's Republic of China in 1954 and successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi . Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution , after which the presidency became vacant . The presidency was abolished under the Constitution of 1975 , then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 , but with reduced powers . The official English-language translation of the title was Chairman ; after 1982 , this translation was changed to President , although the Chinese title remains unchanged .",

  "/wiki/Joko_Widodo": "Joko Widodo ( born Mulyono , 21 June 1961 ) , also known as Jokowi , is an Indonesian politician who is the 7th and current president of Indonesia . Elected in July 2014 as the first president not to come from an elite political or military background , he was previously the Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012 , and the Governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014 . He achieved national prominence in 2009 for his work as the Mayor of Surakarta . A member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle ( PDI-P ) , he was its candidate for the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election , alongside Basuki Tjahaja Purnama ( often known as Ahok ) as his running mate . Defeating incumbent Fauzi Bowo , he took office in October 2012 and reinvigorated Jakarta politics , with publicised blusukan visits ( unannounced spot checks ) and improving the city 's bureaucracy , reducing corruption in the process . He also introduced years-late programs to improve quality of life , including universal healthcare , dredging the city 's main river to reduce flooding , and inaugurating the construction of the city 's subway system . Seen as a rising star in Indonesian politics , PDI-P nominated Jokowi for the 2014 presidential election . Winning a majority of the popular vote , he was named president-elect on 22 July 2014 , to bitter protest from his opponent Prabowo Subianto , who disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed . As president , Jokowi has primarily focused on infrastructure , introducing or restarting long-delayed programs to improve connectivity in the Indonesian archipelago . On foreign policy , his administration has emphasised protecting Indonesias sovereignty , with the sinking of illegal foreign fishing vessels and the prescription of capital punishment for drug smugglers , despite intense pressure from foreign powers including Australia and France . He was re-elected in 2019 for a second five-year term .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Abe is also currently the president of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . He previously served as Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2006 , and as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007 , making him the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history . First elected to the House of Representatives election in the 1993 election , he rose to be appointed chief cabinet secretary by Junichiro Koizumi , before replacing Koizumi as LDP president in September 2006 . He was subsequently confirmed as prime minister by a special session of the National Diet , becoming , aged 52 , Japan 's youngest post-war prime minister , and the first to have been born after World War II . Abe resigned in September 2007 , citing health reasons , shortly after his party lost the House of Councillors election that year . He was replaced by Yasuo Fukuda , the first in a series of five prime ministers who each failed to retain office for more than sixteen months . After recovering from illness , Abe staged an unexpected political comeback , defeating former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba in a vote to become LDP president for a second time in September 2012 . Following the LDP 's landslide victory in the general election that December , he became the first former prime minister to return to the office since Shigeru Yoshida in 1948 . He was later re-elected in similar landslides in the 2014 and 2017 elections . Abe is a conservative whom political commentators have widely described as a right-wing nationalist . He is a member of Nippon Kaigi and holds revisionist views on Japanese history , including denying the role of government coercion in the recruitment of comfort women during World War II , a position which has created tension with neighboring South Korea .",

Located at the heart of the Indochinese peninsula , Laos is bordered by Myanmar and China to the northwest , Vietnam to the east , Cambodia to the southeast and Thailand to the west and southwest . Present Laos traces historic and cultural identity to the kingdom of Lan Xang Hom Khao ( Kingdom of a Million Elephants Under the White Parasol ) , which existed from the mid-fourteenth century to early eighteenth century as one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia . Due to its central geographical location in Southeast Asia , the kingdom became a hub for overland trade , turned wealthy economically and culturally . After a period of internal conflict , Lan Xang broke off into three separate kingdoms - Luang Phrabang , Vientiane , and Champasak . In 1893 , the three territories came under French protectorate and were united to form what is now known as Laos . It briefly gained independence in 1945 after Japanese occupation , but was recolonised by France until it won autonomy in 1949 . Laos became independent in 1953 , with a constitutional monarchy under Sisavang Vong . A post-independence civil war began , which saw the communist resistance , supported by the Soviet Union and North Vietnam , fight against the monarchy that later came under influence of military regimes supported by the United States . After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 , the communist Pathet Lao movement came to power , ending the civil war and establishing a one-party state . Laos was then dependent on military and economic aid from the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991 . In 2018 , the country had the fourth highest GDP ( PPP ) per capita in Southeast Asia , after Singapore , Malaysia , and Thailand .",
