  "intro": "ICC East Asia-Pacific is the International Cricket Council region responsible for administration of the sport of cricket in East Asia and the Pacific area. The region was founded in 1996 with a regional office established in 1999. The area covered by the region includes two Test nations, four ICC associate members and five ICC affiliate nations. The region is headed by the Regional Development Manager, Andrew Faichney, based in Australia at the offices of Cricket Australia. The region is supported by the Australian and New Zealand cricket team and these are the only official Test cricket members in the region. The five Test cricket countries in Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka who are playing in South Asia) are members of the Asian Cricket Council. The EAP is responsible for International tournaments and events, such as: participation in competitions, coaching courses (coach education), umpiring courses, youth development and training; junior/schools programs, administration development, marketing and cricket campsites within the region."
