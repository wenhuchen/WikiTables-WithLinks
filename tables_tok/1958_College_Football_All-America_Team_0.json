The following chart identifies the NCAA-recognized consensus All-Americans and displays which first-team designations they received .",

  "intro": "The 1958 College Football All-America team is composed of college football players who were selected as All-Americans by various organizations and writers that chose College Football All-America Teams in 1958. The six selectors recognized by the NCAA as official for the 1958 season are (1) the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), (2) the Associated Press (AP), (3) the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), (4) the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), (5) the Sporting News, and (6) the United Press International (UPI). Three players were unanimously chosen as first-team All-Americans by all six official selectors. They were: (1) quarterback Randy Duncan who won the 1958 Walter Camp Player of the Year Award and led the 1958 Iowa Hawkeyes to the 1958 FWAA national championship; (2) halfback Billy Cannon who led the 1958 LSU Tigers to the 1958 AP national championship and won the Heisman Trophy in 1959; and (3) Army halfback Pete Dawkins who won the 1958 Heisman Trophy and later became a Rhodes scholar, a brigadier general, co-chairman of Bain & Company, and CEO of Primerica. All three have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame."
