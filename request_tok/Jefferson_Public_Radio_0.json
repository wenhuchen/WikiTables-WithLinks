  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",

  "/wiki/KZBY": "Jefferson Public Radio ( JPR ) is a regional public radio broadcasting network serving over a million potential listeners in Southern Oregon and the Shasta Cascade region of northern California . Owned by Southern Oregon University , the network is headquartered on the SOU campus in Ashland , near Medford . It is named after the proposed State of Jefferson , an area which roughly corresponds to its vast and mostly mountainous coverage area of 60,000 square miles ( 160,000 km2 ) . JPR 's flagship station , KSOR in Ashland , signed on in April 1969 as a 10-watt station operated by students at what was then Southern Oregon College . It began moving away from its college radio roots during the 1970s , becoming a full NPR member by the end of the decade . In the early 1980s , it began building a massive system of translators covering large portions of Oregon and California , and now claims the largest translator network of any public radio station in the country . At first , KSOR was not familiar with the history of Jefferson . However , by the time KSOR began to build full-power satellites later in the decade , it realized that its service area was virtually coextensive with the State of Jefferson . It rebranded itself as Jefferson Public Radio in 1989 , feeling that name was more than appropriate for its growing network and the area it served .",

The city is located on the Pacific coast in the upper northwestern part of California , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) south of the Oregon border . Crescent City 's offshore geography makes it unusually susceptible to tsunamis . Much of the city was destroyed by four tsunami waves generated by the Good Friday earthquake off Anchorage , Alaska in 1964 . More recently , the city 's harbor suffered extensive damage and destruction from tsunamis generated by the March 11 , 2011 earthquake off Sendai , Japan . Several dozen vessels and many of the docks they were moored to were destroyed as wave cycles related to the tsunamis exceeded 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) . Climate of the Crescent City is moderate , with cool summers for its latitude as a result of intense maritime moderation . Nearby inland areas behind the mountains have significantly warmer summer temperatures .",
