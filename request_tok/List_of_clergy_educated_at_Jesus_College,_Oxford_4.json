According to the Cardiganshire County History , 'Theol Coll ' ( as it was affectionately known in the town ) opened in Aberystwyth in 1906 on the seafront site of the former Customs House . This in turn was demolished and the stone-built Cambrian Hotel was built on the site in 1896 to the design of George Croydon Marks , engineer to the Aberystwyth Improvement Company . The hotel failed to prosper and the building was purchased by David Davies MP in 1906 and was presented to the Calvinistic Methodist Connexion as a residential theological college , at a total cost of about \u00a330,000 . The professors and students of Trevecka College in Breconshire were transferred to the new college in 1906 . In 1910 there were about 30 students . Later , because of the falling number of students training for the ministry , the college opened its doors to students wanting to take a theology degree as an academic subject alone . Degrees offered included Bachelor of Divinity ( BD ) and Master of Theology ( MTh ) . Former principals of the college include the Reverend Owen Prys ( 1906-1927 ) , the Revd Samuel Ifor Enoch ( 1963-1979 ) , the Revd Rheinallt Nantlais Williams ( 1979-1980 ) and the Revd John Tudno Williams ( 1998-2003 ) .

  "/wiki/Puritan": "The Puritans were English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries , who sought to purify the Church of England of Roman Catholic practices , maintaining that the Church of England had not been fully reformed and needed to become more protestant . Puritanism played a significant role in English history , especially during the Protectorate . Puritans were dissatisfied with the limited extent of the English Reformation and with the Church of England 's toleration of certain practices associated with the Roman Catholic Church . They formed and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine , as well as personal and corporate piety . Puritans adopted a Reformed theology and , in that sense , were Calvinists ( as were many of their earlier opponents ) . In church polity , some advocated separation from all other established Christian denominations in favour of autonomous gathered churches . These Separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s , when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church . By the late 1630s , Puritans were in alliance with the growing commercial world , with the parliamentary opposition to the royal prerogative , and with the Scottish Presbyterians with whom they had much in common . Consequently , they became a major political force in England and came to power as a result of the First English Civil War ( 1642-1646 ) . Almost all Puritan clergy left the Church of England after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the 1662 Uniformity Act . Many continued to practice their faith in nonconformist denominations , especially in Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches . The nature of the movement in England changed radically , although it retained its character for a much longer period in New England .",

  "/wiki/Unitarianism": "Unitarianism ( from Latin unitas unity , oneness , from unus one ) is a Christian theological movement named for its belief that the God in Christianity is one person , as opposed to the Trinity ( tri- from Latin tres three ) which in most other branches of Christianity defines God as one being in three persons : the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . Unitarian Christians , therefore , believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings , and he is a savior , but he was not a deity or God incarnate . As is typical of dissenters , Unitarianism does not constitute one single Christian denomination , but rather refers to a collection of both existing and extinct Christian groups , whether historically related to each other or not , which share a common theological concept of the oneness nature of God . While the uncompromising theological monotheism at the heart of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major Christian denominations which subscribe to Trinitarian theology , Christian Unitarianism is closer to the monotheistic understandings of God in Judaism , as well as the concept of the oneness of God in Islam . More so , Muslims believe that Christian Unitarianism encompasses the one true monotheistic divine message from God , perpetuated through the Abrahamic faiths that predated Islam . Unitarianism is also known for the rejection of several other Western Christian doctrines , including the doctrines of original sin , predestination , and the infallibility of the Bible . Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell , but few do today . Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism , depending on one 's stance or viewpoint , and some exclude it from that term due to its rejection of the Trinity . Despite common origins during the Protestant Reformation , some scholars call it a part of Nontrinitarianism , while others consider it both Protestant and Nontrinitarian , seeing no contradiction between those two terms . None of the three views is universally accepted . The Unitarian movement is tied to the more radical critiques of the Reformation . First organized in Eastern Europe during the Reformation , Unitarian communities have developed in Britain , South Africa , India , Canada , the United States , Jamaica , Nigeria , and Japan .",
