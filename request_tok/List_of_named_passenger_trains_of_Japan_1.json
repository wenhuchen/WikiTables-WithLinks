With the Mogami River and the Kuma River , it is regarded as one of the three most rapid flows of Japan . The river arises from Mount Nokogiri in the Akaishi Mountains in northwest Yamanashi as the Kamanashi River ( \u91dc\u7121\u5ddd , Kamanashi-gawa ) , and meets the Fuefuki River at the town of Ichikawamisato . There it changes its name to the Fuji River . It then flows around the west foot of Mount Fuji and into Suruga Bay at its mouth in the city of Fuji . The banks of the Fuji River was the location of the Battle of Fujikawa in 1180 , one of the most important early battles of the Genpei War . The Sengoku period warlord Takeda Shingen built extensive dikes along the Kamanashi portion of the river , which allowed water to flood buffer zones to control damage . These dikes still exist , and are called the Shingen-zutsumi ( \u4fe1\u7384\u5824 ) . Flood control efforts continued under the Tokugawa shogunate of the Edo period , when extensive dikes were completed in 1674 after 50 years of construction , to divert the lower river away from populated areas , which were prone to flooding . Water transportation up the river from Suruga Bay to inland Kai Province prospered in the Edo period and early Meiji period , until the opening of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line , Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line and Fuji Minobu Railway railways .
