  "/wiki/Sadie_Thompson_Building": "The Sadie Thompson Inn is a historic building in Malaloa , one of the constituent villages of Pago Pago in American Samoa . The building is noted as the guest house where from mid-December 1916 author W. Somerset Maugham resided for six weeks during an extended trip through the South Sea Islands . He described it as a dilapidated lodging house with a corrugated tin roof and complained that he contracted a stubborn rash , no doubt fungus while at the hotel , and of the weeks it took to cure it . The building was subsequently the setting of his short story Rain , published in 1921 , which depicted a psychological battle of wits between a wayward , on-the-run prostitute , Sadie Thompson , and a conservative , self-righteous missionary . Although conclusive evidence is lacking , Maugham , apparently , was indeed in residence at the lodging house with a real person named Sadie Thompson , who reportedly had been driven from a red light district in Honolulu . Considered one of Maugham 's more noteworthy works , the story was later adapted to the stage and brought to the screen three times . The first film was the 1928 silent Sadie Thompson , starring Gloria Swanson as the titular character and Lionel Barrymore as Alfred Davidson , the missionary . Just four years later , in 1932 , it was filmed again as Rain , with Joan Crawford as Sadie and Walter Huston , the missionary .
