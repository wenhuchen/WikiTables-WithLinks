  "/wiki/Harold_Lloyd": "Harold Clayton Lloyd Sr. ( April 20 , 1893 - March 8 , 1971 ) was an American actor , comedian , and stunt performer who appeared in many silent comedy films . Lloyd is considered alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton as one of the most influential film comedians of the silent film era . Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films , both silent and talkies , between 1914 and 1947 . His bespectacled Glass character was a resourceful , success-seeking go-getter who matched the zeitgeist of the 1920s-era United States . His films frequently contained thrill sequences of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats . Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street ( in reality a trick shot ) in Safety Last ! ( 1923 ) is considered one of the most enduring images in all of cinema . Lloyd performed the lesser stunts himself , despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio . An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right hand ( the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove , and was almost undetectable on the screen ) . Although Lloyd 's individual films were not as commercially successful as Chaplin 's on average , he was far more prolific ( releasing 12 feature films in the 1920s while Chaplin released just four ) , and made more money overall ( $ 15.7 million to Chaplin 's $ 10.5 million ) .

In its early years , Harvard College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy , although it has never been formally affiliated with any denomination . Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century , Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure ( 1869-1909 ) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . A. Lawrence Lowell , who succeeded Eliot , further reformed the undergraduate curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard 's land holdings and physical campus . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II ; he began to liberalize admissions after the war . The university is organized into eleven principal academic units - ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study - with campuses throughout Greater Boston : its 209-acre ( 85 ha ) original undergraduate campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 miles ( 5 km ) northwest of Boston ; the business school and many athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston ; and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area .

Crawford then signed a motion picture contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925 ; her career spanned six decades and fifty-five years , multiple studios , and controversies . At different stages of her career , she was noted for her diverse roles playing sympathetic and unsympathetic characters , and for realistic yet mutli-layered performances . Her films ranged in genres from contemporary crime , melodramas , film noir , several historical costume dramas , romances , mysteries , musicals , suspense , horror , to three westerns and over a dozen comedies . Regardless , her greater successes and perhaps most memorable performances were in romantic dramas and melodramas . In 1999 , The American Film Institute ranked Crawford tenth on its list of the greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema . In the 1930s , Crawford 's fame rivaled and later surpassed that of MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo . Though she started portraying flappers , Crawford often played wealthy women in distress ( Dance , Fools , Dance , This Modern Age , Letty Lynton , No More Ladies , I Live My Life , Susan and God ) or hard-working young women who found romance and success ( Our Dancing Daughters , Paid , Laughing Sinners , Dancing Lady , Sadie McKee , The Last of Mrs. Cheyney , The Shining Hour , The Bride Wore Red , Mannequin ) . These characters and stories were well received by Depression-era audiences , and were popular with women .
