  "/wiki/Chalukya": "The Chalukya dynasty ( [ t\u0283a\u02d0\u026dukj\u0259 ] ) was a Classical Indian royal dynasty that ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries . During this period , they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties . The earliest dynasty , known as the Badami Chalukyas , ruled from Vatapi ( modern Badami ) from the middle of the 6th century . The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II . After the death of Pulakeshin II , the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan . They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century . In the western Deccan , the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants , the Western Chalukyas , in the late 10th century . These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani ( modern Basavakalyan ) until the end of the 12th century . The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka . The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas .

The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration , overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called Chalukyan architecture .",
