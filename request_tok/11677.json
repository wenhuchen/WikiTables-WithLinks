Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

The team have played in the English Premier Ice Hockey League from the 2010-2017 season . After their first season in the EPL , the team achieved a playoff semi-final berth with an 8th-placed finish . The team started the 2011/12 season under the stewardship of Andre Payette , a Canadian forward who is known for his physical presence on the ice rather than his scoring touch , and many in British Ice Hockey had predicted that Sheffield would struggle to a bottom-three finish . Payette 's team , made up predominantly of local players and a small band of Eastern European imports , excelled during the 2011/12 season , pulling off several shock wins , including a win against fierce rivals Manchester Phoenix , a strong 3:1 win against Slough Jets and a fantastic 2:0 away shutout at MK Lightning . The Steeldogs had mixed physical hockey with attacking flare to fire their way to a solid top-5 spot and dispelled any notions of a goon hockey tag by achieving a semi-final place against Milton Keynes Lightning ( Sheffield Steeldogs won the first leg 1:0 at Ice Sheffield ) . The Steeldogs went on to finish third in the league after hinting at a title challenge . A two-goal victory of the Basingstoke Bison in their playoff quarter final led to their first appearance at the playoff finals in Coventry . There the Steeldogs met archrivals the Manchester Phoenix in an epic battle that was decided on penalty shots in favour of the Lancashire outfit . The Steeldogs also reached the EPL cup final but were soundly beaten by league champion Guildford Flames as they did the double . Andre Payette once again led the Steeldogs in 2012/13 but faced a big challenge to repeat the success of the previous season . With young goaltender Ben Bowns making the switch to the EIHL and an aging defence , it proved to be a difficult rebuilding process for the still inexperienced coach .",
