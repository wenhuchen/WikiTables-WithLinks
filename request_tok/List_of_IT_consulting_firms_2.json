Teaneck was created on February 19 , 1895 by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township , both of which are now defunct ( despite existing municipalities with similar names ) , along with portions of Bogota and Leonia . Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January 14 , 1895 , in which voters favored incorporation by a 46-7 margin . To address the concerns of Englewood Township 's leaders , the new municipality was formed as a township , rather than succumbing to the borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time . On May 3 , 1921 , and June 1 , 1926 , portions of what had been Teaneck were transferred to Overpeck Township . Teaneck lies at the junction of Interstate 95 and the eastern terminus of Interstate 80 .

Teaneck 's location at the crossroads of river , road , train and other geographical features has made it a site of many momentous events across the centuries .
