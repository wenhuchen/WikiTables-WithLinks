US 20 and US 30 break the general U.S. Route numbering rules in Oregon , since US 30 actually starts north of US 20 in Astoria , and runs parallel to the north throughout the state ( the Columbia River and Interstate 84 ) . The two run concurrently and continue in the correct positioning near Caldwell , Idaho . This is because US 20 was not a planned coast-to-coast route while US 30 was .
