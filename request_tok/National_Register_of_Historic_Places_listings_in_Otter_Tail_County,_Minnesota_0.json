  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing .

The asylums built in the Kirkbride design , often referred to as Kirkbride Buildings ( or simply Kirkbrides ) , were constructed during the mid-to-late-19th century in the United States . The structural features of the hospitals as designated by Dr. Kirkbride were contingent on his theories regarding the healing of the mentally ill , in which environment and exposure to natural light and air circulation were crucial . The hospitals built according to the Kirkbride Plan would adopt various architectural styles , but had in common the bat wing style floor plan , housing numerous wings that sprawl outward from the center . The first hospital designed under the Kirkbride Plan was the Trenton State Hospital in Trenton , New Jersey , constructed in 1848 . Throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century , numerous psychiatric hospitals were designed under the Kirkbride Plan across the United States . By the twentieth century , popularity of the design had waned , largely due to the economic pressures of maintaining the immense facilities , as well as contestation of Dr. Kirkbride 's theories amongst the medical community . Numerous Kirkbride structures still exist today , though many have been demolished or partially-demolished and repurposed .

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s .

Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 .

  "/wiki/Phelps_Mill": "Phelps Mill is a flour mill in Otter Tail County , Minnesota , United States , on the Otter Tail River . The mill was built in 1888-1889 by William E. Thomas , a local entrepreneur who owned a flour and feed business in Fergus Falls . During that time , wheat was a high-demand crop , and nearly one thousand flour mills were in operation throughout Minnesota . Thomas began constructing a wooden dam on the river in the spring of 1888 , although the dam was prone to leakage and had to be shored up with sandbags , dirt , gravel , and other materials . The mill itself was built by Royal Powers , who built and framed the mill without using blueprints . He was able to keep the entire plan within his head and did not even have to mark out the lumber he was cutting . The mill opened in October 1889 and was designed to produce 60 to 75 barrels of flour per day . It was very successful during its initial several years of operation , and in 1895 Thomas built an addition to grind buckwheat and rye . Thomas also built a bunkhouse for overnight guests and a barn for stabling horses . A general store also was established in the area and is still in operation .",
