( For details , see the section Interpreting shrine names . ) Structurally , a Shinto shrine is usually characterized by the presence of a honden [ note 1 ] or sanctuary , where the kami is enshrined . The honden may however be completely absent , as for example when the shrine stands on a sacred mountain to which it is dedicated , and which is worshipped directly . The honden may also be missing when there are nearby altar-like structures called himorogi or objects believed to be capable of attracting spirits called yorishiro that can serve as a direct bond to a kami . There may be a haiden ( \u62dd\u6bbf , meaning : hall of worship ) and other structures as well ( see below ) . However , a shrine 's most important building is used for the safekeeping of sacred objects rather than for worship . Miniature shrines ( hokora ) can occasionally be found on roadsides .

  "/wiki/Kagura": "The epics Kojiki and Nihon Shoki describe a folktale origin for the dances . In these texts , there is a famous legendary tale about the sun goddess Amaterasu , who retreated into a cave , bringing darkness and cold to the world . Ame-no-Uzume , goddess of the dawn and of revelry , led the other gods in a wild dance , and persuaded Amaterasu to emerge to see what the ruckus was all about . Kagura is one of a number of rituals and arts said to derive from this event . Originally called kamukura or kamikura ( \u795e\u5ea7 ) , kagura began as sacred dances performed at the Imperial court by shrine maidens ( miko ) who were supposedly descendants of Ame-no-Uzume . Over time , however , these Mikagura ( \u5fa1\u795e\u697d ) performed within the sacred and private precincts of the Imperial courts , inspired popular ritual dances , called satokagura ( \u91cc\u795e\u697d ) , which , being popular forms , practiced in villages all around the country , were adapted into various other folk traditions and developed into a number of different forms . Among these are miko kagura , shishi kagura , and Ise-style and Izumo-style kagura dances . Many more variations have developed over the centuries , including some which are fairly new , and most of which have become highly secularized folk traditions . Kagura , in particular those forms that involve storytelling or reenactment of fables , is also one of the primary influences on the Noh theatre .",

Both names translate literally to Japanese stringed instrument . According to Shint\u014d myth as written in the Kojiki , the yamatogoto played an important role in the origins of Japan itself . In the myth , Amaterasu , goddess of the sun , is insulted by her brother Susano-o no Mikoto and hides in a cave , refusing to emerge . The world is therefore plunged into darkness . Amaterasu is eventually coaxed out of her cave by the goddess Ame no Uzume , who performs a dance outside the cave , to music provided by the twanging of six hunting bows . Amused by the music , and by the entertained sounds of the other gods , Amaterasu leaves the cave and returns to the firmament . The six bows are lashed together to form an instrument , and the first wagon or yamatogoto is born . The instrument 's form has changed very little since the eighth century . Similar in shape to the more commonly known koto , the yamatogoto is narrower , as it has fewer strings . Bridges are made from the natural forks of tree branches , particularly maple trees , according to tradition . Unlike many instruments , the yamatogoto 's strings are not arranged in a scale , from low to high pitch , but in a preset melodic sequence which is played in rhythmic patterns .",

  "/wiki/Kana": "Kana ( \u4eee\u540d , Japanese pronunciation : [ kana ] ) are the syllabaries that form parts of the Japanese writing system , contrasted with the logographic Chinese characters known in Japan as kanji ( \u6f22\u5b57 ) . The modern Japanese writing system makes use of two syllabaries : cursive hiragana ( \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a ) and angular katakana ( \u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca ) . Also classified as kana is the ancient syllabic use of kanji known as man'y\u014dgana ( \u4e07\u8449\u4eee\u540d ) , which was ancestral to both hiragana and katakana . Hentaigana ( \u5909\u4f53\u4eee\u540d , variant kana ) are historical variants of modern standard hiragana . In modern Japanese , hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding sets of characters representing the same series of sounds . Katakana , with a few additions , are also used to write Ainu . Taiwanese kana were used in Taiwanese Hokkien as glosses ( furigana ) for Chinese characters in Taiwan under Japanese rule . Each kana character ( syllabogram ) corresponds to one sound in the Japanese language . Apart from the five vowels , this is always CV ( consonant onset with vowel nucleus ) , such as ka , ki , etc. , or V ( vowel ) , such as a , i , etc. , with the sole exception of the C grapheme for nasal codas usually romanised as n. This structure has led some scholars to label the system moraic instead of syllabic , because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda ( i.e . CVn , CVm , CVng ) , a CVV syllable with complex nucleus ( i.e . multiple or expressively long vowels ) , or a CCV syllable with complex onset ( i.e . including a glide , CyV , CwV ) .",

  "/wiki/Saibara": "Saibara ( \u50ac\u99ac\u697d ) is a genre of accompanied vocal Japanese court music that existed during the Heian period in the Nara and Kyoto regions . It draws from traditional folk music ( f\u016bzokuuta ( \u98a8\u4fd7\u6b4c ) ) of the Nara period accompanied by togaku instruments , with the exception of the uchimono ( \u6253\u7269 , percussion instruments ) , which are replaced by shakubyoshi ( \u7b0f\u62cd\u5b50 ) , wooden sticks used for rhythm . It may have developed out of music to drive horses along , as the Chinese characters that compose its name seem to indicate but , according to German musicologist Eta Harich-Schneider , there are several other theories . Song texts are short and simple in character and describe scenes of life . The repertoire was once estimated at some 400 songs . In the late Nara period the aristocracy became more interested in complex foreign musical imports . Emperor Horikawa ( 1079-1107 ) , despite the taste for Chinese culture since the Nara period , also cultivated an interest in f\u016bzokuuta . Courtiers sang saibara songs for entertainment . A fashionable aristocrat was not regarded \u00e0 jour if he did not know of the latest Chinese imports , such as toka music . In the 14th century , because of the many wars , the repertoire of saibara declined , as many were lost due to the turmoil , and it was only at the crowning ceremony ( Daij\u014de ( \u5927\u5617\u4f1a ) ) of emperor Emperor Go-Mizunoo , who ruled from 1611 to 1629 , at Nijo Palace that a reconstruction of the old saibara pieces was attempted and the famous saibara piece Ise no umi was performed at the Imperial palace in Ky\u014dto . The emperor 's wife , Fujiwara no Fusahi , tells in her court chronicles how little old material could be found .

The title , sometimes abbreviated as My\u014dgish\u014d , combines the ruiju ( classified dictionary ) from the Wamy\u014d Ruijush\u014d and the my\u014dgi ( pronunciation and meaning/definition ) from the Tenrei Bansh\u014d My\u014dgi .

The origins of the Ruiju my\u014dgish\u014d are uncertain . Bailey ( 1960:6 ) concludes it was compiled early in the twelfth century , presumably by a priest . Kaneko ( 1996:269 ) believes the received edition dates from the late 12th century , but the original version was compiled around 1081-1100 CE . There are various received texts of the Ruiju my\u014dgish\u014d and several indexes . Like other early Japanese dictionaries , the Ruiju my\u014dgish\u014d borrowed heavily from Chinese dictionaries , in particular the ( ca . 543 CE ) Yupian and the ( 601 CE ) Qieyun . For collation of character entries , the Chinese Yupian has a system of 542 logographic radicals . The Ruiju my\u014dgish\u014d cuts them down into 120 radicals ( bu \u90e8 ) , even simpler than the ( ca . 900 CE ) Japanese Shinsen Jiky\u014d system of 160 .",
