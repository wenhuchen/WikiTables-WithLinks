  "/wiki/Bagatelle_Plantation_House": "The Bagatelle Plantation is a Southern plantation with a historic mansion in Sunshine , Louisiana , USA . The house was designed by architect Robert S. Chadsey in the Greek Revival architectural style in 1841 for the plantation owner , Augustin Marius Tureaud . The historic house has been moved twice . After the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 it was moved a further back from the levee , inside the same property in St. James Parish . In 1977 a second move , due to a purchase of the land by Missouri-Portland Cement Company , brought the house to its present location in Iberville Parish . The house was moved in one piece on a barge up Mississippi River course , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) north of its original location . The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 9 , 2007 .",

  "/wiki/Sunshine,_Louisiana": "Sunshine is a northern neighborhood of the city of St. Gabriel in Iberville Parish , Louisiana , United States . Located approximately 15 miles south of Baton Rouge along the Mississippi River , the community was originally named Forlorn Hope by inhabitants but was given its current name by Oscar Richard , Sr. , who was the post master of the Forlorn Hope , La . post office . He petitioned the federal government for permission to change the name of the post office to Sunshine , La. , in order to give it a more uplifting name . As frequently happens , the villages took the name of the local post office ; hence , the name of the village and community became known as Sunshine , La . The community was annexed to St. Gabriel in 1987 . The Sunshine type of vetiver grass , whose roots have long been used in Louisiana as an insect repellent , was given that name by the USDA in 1989 for Sunshine , Louisiana , where Eugene LeBlanc Sr. grew a heritage clone given to his grandparents by Felix Perilloux , who in turn had acquired it from his wife Myrthee Froisy Perilloux in the 1860s . Vetiver was clonally introduced throughout the tropics in the 19th century , and DNA fingerprinting has shown that almost all the vetiver grown worldwide for perfumery , agriculture , and bioengineering is essentially the same nonfertile cultigen as Sunshine . This type of essential-oil vetiver is known by various names in different locations ( e.g. , 'Monto ' in Australia ) , but because Sunshine was the earliest name used in modern times , that is how it is collectively known throughout the world today .",

  "/wiki/Bayou_Plaquemine_Lock": "Plaquemine Lock State Historic Site , located in Plaquemine , Louisiana , commemorates an early example of hydraulic engineering design and the historic significance of Bayou Plaquemine , an important navigable waterway that was once a distributary of the Mississippi River . Bayou Plaquemine promoted settlement beginning in the 18th century and helped the area economically by providing an access route between southwestern Louisiana ( and thus Texas ) and the Mississippi via the Atchafalaya Basin . The lock itself was designed by Colonel George Washington Goethals of the United States Army Corps of Engineers , who later served as chief engineer of the construction of the Panama Canal Lock , and went on to be the Canal Zone 's first governor . Plaquemine Lock was opened on April 9 , 1909 after 14 years of construction . When it was built , Plaquemine Lock was the highest freshwater lift of any lock in the world . The lock initially utilized a gravity-flow principle until pumps were installed years later . The lock was closed after 52 years of service in 1961 due to increased river traffic and the demand for a larger lock , which opened thereafter in Port Allen . The Plaquemine Lock structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 . Today , the Gary James Hebert Memorial Lockhouse serves as an on-site museum and visitors center . It is named for the man who led the way to help preserve the Lock site , which today covers 19 acres ( 7.7 ha ) .",
  "/wiki/Mississippi_River": "The Mississippi River is the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent , second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system . From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota , it flows generally south for 2,320 miles ( 3,730 km ) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico . With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains . The main stem is entirely within the United States ; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi ( 2,980,000 km2 ) , of which only about one percent is in Canada . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States . Formed from thick layers of the river 's silt deposits , the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States ; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods .",
