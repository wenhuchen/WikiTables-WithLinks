Approximately 130 km south of the city of Bahawalpur , the forty bastions of Derawar are visible for many miles in the Cholistan Desert . The walls have a perimeter of 1500 metres and stand up to thirty metres high .

The fort was initially known as Dera Rawal , and later referred to as Dera Rawar , which with the passage of time came to be pronounced Derawar , its present name . In the 18th century , the fort was taken over by Muslim Nawabs of Bahawalpur from the Shahotra tribe . It was later rebuilt in its current form in 1732 by the Abbasi ruler Nawab Sadeq Muhammad , but in 1747 the fort slipped from their hands owing to Bahawal Khan 's preoccupations at Shikarpur . Nawab Mubarak Khan took the stronghold back in 1804 . 1,000 year-old catapult shells were found in the debris near a decaying wall in the fort . Nawab Sadeq Muhammad Khan Abbasi V , the 12th and last ruler of Bahawalpur state , was born in the fort in 1904 .

It originated with the life and teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad ( 1835-1908 ) , who claimed to have been divinely appointed as both the promised Mahdi ( Guided One ) and Messiah expected by Muslims to appear towards the end times and bring about , by peaceful means , the final triumph of Islam ; as well as to embody , in this capacity , the expected eschatological figure of other major religious traditions . Adherents of the Ahmadiyya - a term adopted expressly in reference to Muhammad 's alternative name A\u1e25mad - are known as Ahmadi Muslims or simply Ahmadis . Ahmadi thought emphasizes the belief that Islam is the final dispensation for humanity as revealed to Muhammad and the necessity of restoring it to its true intent and pristine form , which had been lost through the centuries . Its adherents consider Ahmad to have appeared as the Mahdi - bearing the qualities of Jesus in accordance with their reading of scriptural prophecies - to revitalize Islam and set in motion its moral system that would bring about lasting peace . They believe that upon divine guidance he purged Islam of foreign accretions in belief and practice by championing what is , in their view , Islam 's original precepts as practised by Muhammad and the early Muslim community . Ahmadis thus view themselves as leading the propagation and renaissance of Islam . Mirza Ghulam Ahmad established the Community ( or Jam\u0101\u02bfat ) on 23 March 1889 by formally accepting allegiance from his supporters . Since his death , the Community has been led by a number of Caliphs and has spread to 210 countries and territories of the world as of 2017 with concentrations in South Asia , West Africa , East Africa , and Indonesia . The Ahmadis have a strong missionary tradition and formed the first Muslim missionary organization to arrive in Britain and other Western countries . Currently , the Community is led by its Caliph , Mirza Masroor Ahmad , and is estimated to number between 10 and 20 million worldwide . The population is almost entirely contained in the single , highly organized and united movement .",

  "/wiki/Shia_Islam": "Shia Islam or Shi'ism is one of the two main branches of Islam . It holds that the Islamic prophet Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor and the Imam ( leader ) after him , most notably at the event of Ghadir Khumm , but was prevented from the caliphate as a result of the incident of Saqifah . This view primarily contrasts with that of Sunni Islam , whose adherents believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor and consider Abu Bakr , who was appointed caliph by a small group of Muslims at Saqifah , to be the first rightful caliph after the Prophet . Unlike the first three Rashidun caliphs , Ali was from the same clan as Muhammad , Banu Hashim , as well as being the prophet 's cousin and being the first male to become Muslim . Shia Islam is the second largest branch of Islam : as of the late 2000s , Shia Muslims constituted 10-15% of all Muslims . Twelver Shia is the largest branch of Shia Islam , with 2012 estimates saying that 85% of Shias were Twelvers . Shia Islam is based on the prophet 's hadith ( Ghadir Khumm ) . Shia consider Ali to have been divinely appointed as the successor to Muhammad , and as the first Imam . The Shia also extend this Imammah to Muhammad 's family , the Ahl al-Bayt ( the people/family of the House ) , and some individuals among his descendants , known as Imams , who they believe possess special spiritual and political authority over the community , infallibility and other divinely ordained traits .

Their founder Babur , a Timurid prince from the Fergana Valley ( in modern Uzbekistan ) , was a direct descendant of Timur ( generally known in western nations as Tamerlane ) and also affiliated with Genghis Khan through Timur 's marriage to a Genghisid princess .

  "/wiki/Mughal_Empire": "The Mughal Empire or Mogul Empire , was an early-modern empire in South Asia . For some two centuries , the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus basin in the west , northern Afghanistan in the northwest , and Kashmir in the north , to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east , and the uplands of the Deccan plateau in South India . The Mughal empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur , a warrior chieftain from what today is Uzbekistan , who employed aid from the neighboring Safavid- and Ottoman empires , to defeat the Sultan of Delhi , Ibrahim Lodhi , in the First Battle of Panipat , and to sweep down the plains of Upper India . The Mughal imperial structure , however , is sometimes dated to 1600 , to the rule of Babur 's grandson , Akbar , This imperial structure lasted until 1720 , until shortly after the death of the last major emperor , Aurengzeb , during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent . Reduced subsequently , especially during the East India Company rule in India , to the region in and around Old Delhi , the empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . Although the Mughal empire was created and sustained by military warfare , it did not vigorously suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule , but rather equalized and placated them through new administrative practices , and diverse ruling elites , leading to more efficient , centralised , and standardized rule . The base of the empire 's collective wealth was agricultural taxes , instituted by the third Mughal emperor , Akbar . These taxes , which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator , were paid in the well-regulated silver currency , and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets . The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India 's economic expansion . Burgeoning European presence in the Indian ocean , and its increasing demand for Indian raw- and finished products , created still greater wealth in the Mughal courts . There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite , resulting in greater patronage of painting , literary forms , textiles , and architecture , especially during the reign of Shah Jahan . Among the Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Asia are : Agra Fort , Fatehpur Sikri , Red Fort , Humayun 's Tomb , Lahore Fort and the Taj Mahal , which is described as , The jewel of Muslim art in India , and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world 's heritage .",

These orders meet for spiritual sessions ( majalis ) in meeting places known as zawiyas , khanqahs or tekke . They strive for ihsan ( perfection of worship ) , as detailed in a hadith : Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him ; if you ca n't see Him , surely He sees you . Sufis regard Muhammad as al-Ins\u0101n al-K\u0101mil , the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God , and see him as their leader and prime spiritual guide . All Sufi orders trace most of their original precepts from Muhammad through his cousin and son-in-law Ali , with the notable exception of the Naqshbandi order , who trace their original precepts to Muhammad through his companion and father-in-law , Abu Bakr . It has historically been mistaken as a sect of Islam , when it is in fact a religious order for any Islamic denomination .

Though the Karachi region has been inhabited for millennia , the city was founded as the fortified village of Kolachi in 1729 . The settlement drastically increased in importance with the arrival of British East India Company in the mid 19th century , who not only embarked on major works to transform the city into a major seaport , but also connected it with their extensive railway network . By the time of the Partition of British India , the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000 . Following the independence of Pakistan , the city 's population increased dramatically with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from India .

Any act of worship that follows the Islamic rules of prayer can be said to create a mosque , whether or not it takes place in a special building . Informal and open-air places of worship are called musalla , while mosques used for communal prayer on Fridays are known as j\u0101mi\u02bf . Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche ( mihrab ) set into the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca ( qiblah ) , ablution facilities and minarets from which calls to prayer are issued . The pulpit ( minbar ) , from which the Friday ( jumu'ah ) sermon ( khutba ) is delivered , was in earlier times characteristic of the central city mosque , but has since become common in smaller mosques . Mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women . This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region , period and denomination . Mosques commonly serve as locations for prayer , Ramadan vigils , funeral services , Sufi ceremonies , marriage and business agreements , alms collection and distribution , as well as homeless shelters . Historically , mosques were also important centers of elementary education and advanced training in religious sciences . In modern times , they have preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate , but higher learning now generally takes place in specialised institutions . Special importance is accorded to the Great Mosque of Mecca ( centre of the hajj ) , the Prophet 's Mosque in Medina ( burial place of Muhammad ) and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem ( believed to be the site of Muhammad 's ascent to heaven ) . In the past , many mosques in the Muslim world were built over burial places of Sufi saints and other venerated figures , which has turned them into popular pilgrimage destinations .",

  "/wiki/Shia": "Shia Islam or Shi'ism is one of the two main branches of Islam . It holds that the Islamic prophet Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor and the Imam ( leader ) after him , most notably at the event of Ghadir Khumm , but was prevented from the caliphate as a result of the incident of Saqifah . This view primarily contrasts with that of Sunni Islam , whose adherents believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor and consider Abu Bakr , who was appointed caliph by a small group of Muslims at Saqifah , to be the first rightful caliph after the Prophet . Unlike the first three Rashidun caliphs , Ali was from the same clan as Muhammad , Banu Hashim , as well as being the prophet 's cousin and being the first male to become Muslim . Shia Islam is the second largest branch of Islam : as of the late 2000s , Shia Muslims constituted 10-15% of all Muslims . Twelver Shia is the largest branch of Shia Islam , with 2012 estimates saying that 85% of Shias were Twelvers . Shia Islam is based on the prophet 's hadith ( Ghadir Khumm ) . Shia consider Ali to have been divinely appointed as the successor to Muhammad , and as the first Imam . The Shia also extend this Imammah to Muhammad 's family , the Ahl al-Bayt ( the people/family of the House ) , and some individuals among his descendants , known as Imams , who they believe possess special spiritual and political authority over the community , infallibility and other divinely ordained traits . Although there are many Shia subsects , modern Shia Islam has been divided into two main groupings : Twelvers and Ismailis , with Twelver Shia being the largest and most influential group among Shia .",
