  "/wiki/Islamic_terrorism": "Islamic terrorism , Islamist terrorism or radical Islamic terrorism are terrorist acts against civilians committed by violent Islamists who claim a religious motivation . The largest numbers of incidents and fatalities caused by Islamic terrorism have occurred in places like Iraq , Afghanistan , Nigeria , Pakistan , Yemen and Syria . In 2015 four Islamic extremist groups were responsible for 74% of all deaths from Islamic terrorism : ISIS , Boko Haram , the Taliban and Al-Qaeda , according to the Global Terrorism Index 2016 . Since approximately 2000 , these incidents have occurred on a global scale , affecting not only Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia , but also states with non-Muslim majority such as United States , United Kingdom , France , Germany , Spain , Belgium , Russia , Australia , Canada , Israel , China , India and Philippines along with some occasional targeting of citizens from Italy , Sweden , Denmark , New Zealand , South Korea and Japan . Such attacks have targeted both Muslims and non-Muslims , however the majority affects Muslims themselves . In a number of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions , these terrorists have been met by armed , independent resistance groups , state actors and their proxies , and elsewhere by condemnation coming from prominent Islamic figures . Justifications given for attacks on civilians by Islamic extremist groups come from extreme interpretations of the Quran and Hadith , and sharia law . These include retribution by armed jihad for the perceived injustices of unbelievers against Muslims ( especially by Al-Qaeda ) ; the belief that the killing of many self-proclaimed Muslims is required because they have violated Islamic law and are actually disbelievers ( kafir ) ; the need to restore and purify Islam by establishing sharia law , especially by restoring the Caliphate as a pan-Islamic state ( especially ISIS ) ; the glory and heavenly rewards of martyrdom ; the supremacy of Islam over all other religions . [ Note 1 ] Use of the phrase Islamic terrorism is disputed . In Western political speech it has variously been called counter-productive , highly politicized , intellectually contestable and damaging to community relations . Others have condemned the refusal to use the term as an act of self-deception , full-blown censorship and intellectual dishonesty .",
  "/wiki/Terrorism": "Terrorism is , in the broadest sense , the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes . It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants ( mostly civilians and neutral military personnel ) . The terms terrorist and terrorism originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland , the Basque Country and Palestine . The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington , D.C. in 2001 . There are different definitions of terrorism . Terrorism is a charged term . It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong . Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups . Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives . These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations , nationalist groups , religious groups , revolutionaries and ruling governments . Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states . When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states , it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it , making legality a largely grey-area issue .",
  "/wiki/Firing_squad": "Execution by firing squad , in the past sometimes called fusillading ( from the French fusil , rifle ) , is a method of capital punishment , particularly common in the military and in times of war . Execution by shooting is a fairly old practice . Some reasons for its use are that firearms are usually readily available and a gunshot to a vital organ , such as brain or heart , usually kills relatively quickly . A firing squad is normally composed of several military personnel . Usually , all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously , thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot . To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head , the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart , sometimes aided by a paper target . The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded , as well as restrained , although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered . Media portrayals have frequently shown condemned being offered a final cigarette as well . Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting . There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light or at sunrise . This gave rise to the phrase shot at dawn . Execution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms , such as an execution by shooting to the back of the head or neck .",

It is the seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",

  "/wiki/Mercenary": "A mercenary , sometimes known as a soldier of fortune , is an individual who takes part in military conflict for personal profit , is otherwise an outsider to the conflict , and is not a member of any other official military . Mercenaries fight for money or other forms of payment rather than for political interests . Beginning in the 20th century , mercenaries have increasingly come to be seen as less entitled to protections by rules of war than non-mercenaries . Indeed , the Geneva Conventions declare that mercenaries are not recognized as legitimate combatants and do not have to be granted the same legal protections as captured service personnel of a regular army . In practice , whether or not a person is a mercenary may be a matter of degree , as financial and political interests may overlap , as was often the case in all of history .",
  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",

  "/wiki/Hanging": "Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck . The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck , though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain hanging . Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times , and is the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions . The first known account of execution by hanging was in Homer 's Odyssey ( Book XXII ) . In this specialised meaning of the common word hang , the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung . Hanging is also a common method of suicide in which a person applies a ligature to the neck and brings about unconsciousness and then death by suspension or partial suspension .",

Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

  "/wiki/Eswatini": "Eswatini ( /\u02cc\u025bsw\u0251\u02d0\u02c8ti\u02d0ni/ ESS-wah-TEE-nee ; Swazi : eSwatini [ \u025bsw\u00e1\u02c8t\u02bci\u02d0ni ] ) , officially the Kingdom of Eswatini ( Swazi : Umbuso weSwatini ) and also known as Swaziland ( /\u02c8sw\u0251\u02d0zil\u00e6nd/ SWAH-zee-land ; officially renamed in 2018 ) , is a landlocked country in Southern Africa . It is bordered by Mozambique to its northeast and South Africa to its north , west , and south . At no more than 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) north to south and 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) east to west , Eswatini is one of the smallest countries in Africa ; despite this , its climate and topography are diverse , ranging from a cool and mountainous highveld to a hot and dry lowveld . The population is composed primarily of ethnic Swazis . The language is Swazi ( siSwati in native form ) . The Swazis established their kingdom in the mid-18th century under the leadership of Ngwane III . The country and the Swazi take their names from Mswati II , the 19th-century king under whose rule Swazi territory was expanded and unified ; the present boundaries were drawn up in 1881 in the midst of the Scramble for Africa . After the Second Boer War , the kingdom , under the name of Swaziland , was a British protectorate from 1903 until it regained its independence on 6 September 1968 . In April 2018 , the official name was changed from Kingdom of Swaziland to Kingdom of Eswatini , mirroring the name commonly used in Swazi . The government is an absolute monarchy , ruled by King Mswati III since 1986 . Elections are held every five years to determine the House of Assembly and the Senate majority . The current constitution was adopted in 2005 ."
