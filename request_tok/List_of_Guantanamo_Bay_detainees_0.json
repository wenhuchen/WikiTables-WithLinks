Aamer was seized in Afghanistan by bounty hunters , who handed him over to US forces in December 2001 during the United States military operation in the country . Two months later , the US rendered Aamer to the Guant\u00e1namo camp ; he was held there without trial or charge . Aamer had been a legal resident in Britain for years before his imprisonment ; the UK government repeatedly demanded his release , and many people there called for him to be released . According to documents published in the Guantanamo Bay files leak , the US military Joint Task Force Guantanamo believed that Aamer had led a unit of fighters in Afghanistan , including the Battle of Tora Bora , while his family was paid a stipend by Osama bin Laden . The file asserts past associations with Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui . Aamer denies being involved in terrorist activity and his lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , said the leaked documents would not stand up in court . He claimed that part of the evidence came from an unreliable witness and that confessions Aamer made had been obtained through torture . Aamer 's father-in-law , Saaed Ahmed Siddique , said : All of these claims have no basis . If any of this was true he would be in a court now . The Bush administration acknowledged later that it had no evidence against Aamer . Aamer has never been charged with any wrongdoing , was never on trial , and his lawyer says he is totally innocent .",
