Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland , Botswana adopted its name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966 . Since then , it has been a representative republic , with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections and the lowest perceived corruption ranking in Africa since at least 1998 . It is currently Africa 's oldest continuous democracy. , Botswana is topographically flat , with up to 70 percent of its territory being the Kalahari Desert . It is bordered by South Africa to the south and southeast , Namibia to the west and north , and Zimbabwe to the northeast . Its border with Zambia to the north near Kazungula is poorly defined but is , at most , a few hundred metres long . A mid-sized country of just over 2.3 million people , Botswana is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world . Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city , Gaborone . Formerly one of the poorest countries in the world - with a GDP per capita of about US $ 70 per year in the late 1960s - Botswana has since transformed itself into one of the world 's fastest-growing economies . The economy is dominated by mining , cattle , and tourism . Botswana boasts a GDP ( purchasing power parity ) per capita of about $ 18,825 per year as of 2015 [ update ] , which is one of the highest in Africa . Its high gross national income ( by some estimates the fourth-largest in Africa ) gives the country a relatively high standard of living and one of the highest Human Development Index of continental Sub-Saharan Africa .",

  "/wiki/Armaniidae": "Armaniidae was sometimes treated as the most basal of the Formicidae subfamilies , and classed as a stem-group which is more distant in relation to modern ants than the next stem group , Sphecomyrminae . More often the group , treated as ant-like wasps , was elevated to the rank of family , and considered as a possible sister group to Formicidae . It has been suggested by Engel and Grimaldi that the group may be paraphyletic . This position is in contrast to the original hypothesis of Russian paleoentomologist Gennady Dlussky , who first described the family . Dlussky considered the group , when erected in 1983 , have been an intermediate family bridging the families Scoliidae and the true formicids . In contrast to both the treatment as a separate family and as a distinct subfamily , entomologist E. O. Wilson , in a 1987 paper , suggested that the then known armaniids and Sphecomyrma represented a single species . Wilson , in synonymizing the groups , made the hypothesis that the different described genera were actually fossils of different castes of the same species , with Sphecomyrma freyi being workers , Armania robusta being queens , and Paleomyrmex zherichini as the winged males . This view was rejected as new fossils and species were described . The group is known exclusively from impression fossils , which have a limited preservation quality , leading to the uncertainty of what features are present in the described species . Overall armaniids have a poorly developed petiole which is broadly attached to the thorax , short scapes on the antennae , and queen-like looking females . The mandibles are vespid like , with possibly only one or two teeth , though this may be an artifact of preservation . The short scape is a feature that is also seen in Sphecomyrminae members , and does not exclude armaniids from Formicidae .",

In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Mainland Southeast Asia . The early 19th century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well .
