  "/wiki/Manchester": "Manchester ( /\u02c8m\u00e6nt\u0283\u025bst\u0259r/ ) is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester , England , with a population of 547,627 as of 2018 ( 5th most populous English district ) . It lies within the United Kingdom 's second-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.9 million , and second-most populous metropolitan area , with a population of 3.3 million . It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",
  "/wiki/John_Ruskin": "John Ruskin ( 8 February 1819 - 20 January 1900 ) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era , as well as an art patron , draughtsman , watercolourist , prominent social thinker and philanthropist . He wrote on subjects as varied as geology , architecture , myth , ornithology , literature , education , botany and political economy . His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied . He penned essays and treatises , poetry and lectures , travel guides and manuals , letters and even a fairy tale . He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks , plants , birds , landscapes , and architectural structures and ornamentation . The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively . In all of his writing , he emphasised the connections between nature , art and society . He was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the First World War . After a period of relative decline , his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work . Today , his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism , sustainability and craft . Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of Modern Painters ( 1843 ) , an extended essay in defence of the work of J. M. W. Turner in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is truth to nature . From the 1850s , he championed the Pre-Raphaelites , who were influenced by his ideas .",

  "/wiki/County_Durham": "County Durham ( /\u02c8d\u028cr\u0259m/ , locally /\u02c8d\u025cr\u0259m/ listen ) [ note 1 ] is a county in North East England . The county town is Durham , a cathedral city . County Durham can refer to the modern ceremonial county , the smaller area of a unitary authority , or the historic county with different boundaries . The largest settlement in the ceremonial county is Darlington , closely followed by Hartlepool , Billingham and Stockton-on-Tees . It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east , Northumberland to the north , Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south . The area of the unitary authority , Durham County Council , does not include Darlington , Hartlepool or Stockton-on-Tees . The historic county 's boundaries stretch between the rivers Tyne and Tees , thus including places such as Gateshead , Jarrow , South Shields and Sunderland , but do not include the part of the modern county south of the Tees . During the Middle Ages , the county was an ecclesiastical centre , due largely to the presence of St Cuthbert 's shrine in Durham Cathedral , and the extensive powers granted to the Bishop of Durham as ruler of the County Palatine of Durham . The county has a mixture of mining , farming and heavy railway heritage , with the latter especially noteworthy in the southeast of the county , in Darlington , Shildon and Stockton . It is an area of regeneration and promoted as a tourist destination ; in the centre of the city of Durham , Durham Castle and Durham Cathedral are UNESCO-designated World Heritage Sites .",

  "/wiki/Cast_iron": "Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2% . Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature . The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured : white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through , grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks , and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite nodules which stop the crack from further progressing . Carbon ( C ) ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt% , and silicon ( Si ) 1-3 wt% , are the main alloying elements of cast iron . Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel . Cast iron tends to be brittle , except for malleable cast irons . With its relatively low melting point , good fluidity , castability , excellent machinability , resistance to deformation and wear resistance , cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes , machines and automotive industry parts , such as cylinder heads , cylinder blocks and gearbox cases . It is resistant to damage by oxidation . The earliest cast-iron artefacts date to the 5th century BC , and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu in China . Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare , agriculture , and architecture . During the 15th century , cast iron became utilized for cannon in Burgundy , France , and in England during the Reformation . The amounts of cast iron used for cannon required large scale production .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Cant_(architecture)": "Cant or canted in architecture is an angled ( oblique ) line or surface particularly which cuts off a corner . Canted facades are a typical of , but not exclusive to , Baroque architecture . The angle breaking the facade is less than a right angle , thus enabling a canted facade to be viewed as , and remain , one composition . Bay windows frequently have canted sides .",
  "/wiki/Turret": "In architecture , a turret ( from Italian : torretta , little tower ; Latin : turris , tower ) is a small tower that projects vertically from the wall of a building such as a medieval castle . Turrets were used to provide a projecting defensive position allowing covering fire to the adjacent wall in the days of military fortification . As their military use faded , turrets were used for decorative purposes , as in the Scottish baronial style . A turret can have a circular top with crenelations as seen in the picture at right , a pointed roof , or other kind of apex . It might contain a staircase if it projects higher than the building ; however , a turret is not necessarily higher than the rest of the building ; in this case , it is typically part of a room , that can be simply walked into - see the turret of Chateau de Chaumont on the collection of turrets , which also illustrates a turret on a modern skyscraper . A building may have both towers and turrets ; turrets might be smaller or higher but turrets instead project from the edge of a building rather than continue to the ground . The size of a turret is therefore limited , since it puts additional stresses on the structure of the building . Turrets were traditionally supported by a corbel . In modern times , a gun turret is a weapon mount that houses the crew or mechanism of a projectile-firing weapon , allowing the weapon to be aimed and fired in some degree of azimuth and elevation . It can be found on warships , combat vehicles , military aircraft , and land fortifications , and usually offers some degree of armour or protection .",
  "/wiki/Lucarne": "In architecture , a lucarne is a feature of a warehouse , mill or factory . A window or opening high up on an outside wall supports a hoist above doors on the floors below . The original term French : lucarne refers to a dormer window , usually set into the middle of a roof although it can also apply to a facade lucarne , where the gable of the lucarne is aligned with the face of the wall . This general meaning is also preserved in British use , particularly for small windows into unoccupied attic or spire spaces . Pevsner gives its meaning as a small gabled opening in a roof or a spire .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/French_Gothic_architecture": "French Gothic architecture is an architectural style which emerged in France in 1140 , and was dominant until the mid-16th century . The most notable examples are the great Gothic cathedrals of France , including Notre-Dame Cathedral , Reims Cathedral , Chartres Cathedral , and Amiens Cathedral . Its main characteristics were the search for verticality , or height , and the innovative use of flying buttresses and other architectural innovations to distribute the weight of the stone structures to supports on the outside , allowing unprecedented height and volume , The new techniques also permitted the addition of larger windows , including enormous stained glass windows , which filled the cathedrals with light . The French style was widely copied in other parts of northern Europe , particularly Germany and England . It was gradually supplanted as the dominant French style in the mid-16th century by French Renaissance architecture .",
  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

Merseyside , which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , takes its name from the River Mersey . Merseyside spans 249 square miles ( 645 km2 ) of land which border Lancashire ( to the north-east ) , Greater Manchester ( to the east ) , Cheshire ( to the south and south-east ) and the Irish Sea to the west . North Wales is across the Dee Estuary . There is a mix of high density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Merseyside , but overwhelmingly the land use is urban . It has a focused central business district , formed by Liverpool City Centre , but Merseyside is also a polycentric county with five metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . The Liverpool Urban Area is the fifth most populous conurbation in England , and dominates the geographic centre of the county , while the smaller Birkenhead Urban Area dominates the Wirral Peninsula in the south . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Merseyside County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) are now effectively unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and several county-wide services are co-ordinated by authorities and joint-boards , such as Merseytravel ( for public transport ) , Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the Merseyside Police ( for law-enforcement ) ; as a ceremonial county , Merseyside has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . As the Lancashire county palatine boundaries remain the same as the historic boundaries , the High Sheriff of Merseyside , along with those of Lancashire and Greater Manchester are appointed within the Duchy and County Palatine of Lancaster .",
  "/wiki/Liverpool_Lime_Street_railway_station": "Liverpool Lime Street is a terminus railway station , and the main station serving the city centre of Liverpool . Opened in August 1836 , it is the oldest grand terminus mainline station still in use in the world . A branch of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston terminates at the station , as does the original Liverpool and Manchester Railway . Services from this station serve a wide range of destinations across England and Wales , with direct services to Scottish destinations to be reintroduced in autumn 2019 . Having realised that their existing Crown Street Station was too far away from the city centre , the Liverpool and Manchester Railway ( L & MR ) commenced construction of the more central Lime Street Station in October 1833 . Designed by John Cunningham , Arthur Holme , and John Foster Jr , it was officially opened in August 1836 . Proving to be very popular with the railway-going public , within six years of its opening , expansion of the station had become necessary . The first expansion , which was collaboratively produced by Joseph Locke , Richard Turner , William Fairbairn and John Kennedy , was completed during 1849 at a total cost of \u00a315,000 ( equivalent to \u00a31,570,000 in 2019 ) .

Several notable royal ch\u00e2teaux in this style were built in the Loire Valley , notably the Chateau de Montsoreau , the Chateau de Langeais , the Chateau d'Amboise , the Chateau of Blois , the Chateau of Gaillon , and the Chateau of Chambord , and , closer to Paris , the Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau . This style of French architecture had two distinct periods . During the first period , between about 1450 and 1590 , the Italian style was copied directly , often by Italian architects and craftsmen . In the second period , between 1540 and the end of the Valois dynasty in 1589 , French architects and craftsmen gave the style a more distinctive and original French character .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

The historic county therefore includes territory that is now administered by the Vale of White Horse and parts of South Oxfordshire in Oxfordshire , but excludes Caversham , Slough and five less populous settlements in the east of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead . All the changes mentioned , apart from the change to Caversham , took place in 1974 . The towns of Abingdon , Didcot , Faringdon , Wallingford and Wantage were transferred to Oxfordshire , the six places joining came from Buckinghamshire . Berkshire County Council was the main local government of most areas from 1889 to 1998 and was based in Reading , the county town which had its own County Borough administration ( 1888-1974 ) . Since 1998 , Berkshire has been governed by the six unitary authorities of Bracknell Forest , Reading , Slough , West Berkshire , Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham . The ceremonial county borders Oxfordshire ( to the north ) , Buckinghamshire ( to the north-east ) , Greater London ( to the east ) , Surrey ( to the south-east ) , Wiltshire ( to the west ) and Hampshire ( to the south ) .",
  "/wiki/Terracotta": "Terracotta , terra cotta or terra-cotta ( pronounced [ \u02cct\u025brra\u02c8k\u0254tta ] ; Italian : baked earth , from the Latin terra cocta ) , a type of earthenware , is a clay-based unglazed or glazed ceramic , where the fired body is porous . Terracotta is the term normally used for sculpture made in earthenware , and also for various practical uses including vessels ( notably flower pots ) , water and waste water pipes , roofing tiles , bricks , and surface embellishment in building construction . The term is also used to refer to the natural brownish orange color of most terracotta , which varies considerably . [ citation needed ] This article covers the senses of terracotta as a medium in sculpture , as in the Terracotta Army and Greek terracotta figurines , and architectural decoration . Asian and European sculpture in porcelain is not covered . Glazed architectural terracotta and its unglazed version as exterior surfaces for buildings were used in Asia for some centuries before becoming popular in the West in the 19th century . Architectural terracotta can also refer to decorated ceramic elements such as antefixes and revetments , which made a large contribution to the appearance of temples and other buildings in the classical architecture of Europe , as well as in the Ancient Near East . [ citation needed ] In archaeology and art history , terracotta is often used to describe objects such as figurines not made on a potter 's wheel . Vessels and other objects that are or might be made on a wheel from the same material are called earthenware pottery ; the choice of term depends on the type of object rather than the material or firing technique . Unglazed pieces , and those made for building construction and industry , are also more likely to be referred to as terracotta , whereas tableware and other vessels are called earthenware ( though sometimes terracotta if unglazed ) , or by a more precise term such as faience .

  "/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London": "The Natural History Museum in London is a natural history museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history . It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington , the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum . The Natural History Museum 's main frontage , however , is on Cromwell Road . The museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections : botany , entomology , mineralogy , paleontology and zoology . The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy , identification and conservation . Given the age of the institution , many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value , such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin . The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architecture - sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature - both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling . The Natural History Museum Library contains extensive books , journals , manuscripts , and artwork collections linked to the work and research of the scientific departments ; access to the library is by appointment only . The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world . Although commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum , it was officially known as British Museum ( Natural History ) until 1992 , despite legal separation from the British Museum itself in 1963 . Originating from collections within the British Museum , the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881 and later incorporated the Geological Museum . The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition , partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections .",
  "/wiki/Cromwell_Road": "Cromwell Road is a major London road in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea , designated as part of the A4 . It was created in the 19th century and is said to be named after Richard Cromwell , son of Oliver Cromwell , who once owned a house there . The Security Service ( MI5 ) was based at 35 Cromwell Road from 1929 to 1934 . Cromwell Road was not always the main traffic route it is now , as when it was built , it ended at Earls Court . The Cromwell Road extension , across the West London railway line and towards Hammersmith , was authorised as a bridge across the railway in 1884 but completed only in 1941 . Thus , it was only after the Second World War that it became the main A4 route into London . The large traffic increase brought much demolition and road rearrangement beyond Earls Court Road in 1967 to 1972 , but the main part of Cromwell Road has not had its basic building line changed . 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) long , it starts as West Cromwell Road , near West Kensington Underground station , and continues eastwards from Talgarth Road . It becomes Cromwell Road proper as it crosses Earl 's Court Road . It travels just south of Cromwell Hospital , and then past Gloucester Road and Gloucester Road Underground station . The next major crossroads comes at the intersection with Queen 's Gate , on the corner of which stands Baden-Powell House , the former headquarters of The Scout Association . The road then passes to the south of a museum-academic complex , informally known as Albertopolis , including the Natural History Museum , the Science Museum , Imperial College London and the Victoria and Albert Museum , near South Kensington Underground station .",

  "/wiki/Greater_London": "Greater London is a ceremonial county of England that makes up the majority of the London region . This region forms the administrative boundaries of London and is organised into 33 local government districts - the 32 London boroughs and the City of London , which is located within the region but is separate from the county . The Greater London Authority , based in Southwark , is responsible for strategic local government across the region and consists of the Mayor of London and the London Assembly . The City of London Corporation is the principal local authority for the City of London , with a similar role to that of the 32 London borough councils . Administratively , Greater London was first established as a sui generis council area under the Greater London Council between 1963 and 1986 . The county of Greater London was created on 1 April 1965 through the London Government Act 1963 . The area was re-established as a region in 1994 . The Greater London Authority was formed in 2000 . The region covers 1,572 km2 ( 607 sq mi ) and had a population of 8,174,000 at the 2011 census .

  "/wiki/Wrought_iron": "Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon ( less than 0.08% ) content in contrast to cast iron ( 2.1% to 4% ) . It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions ( up to 2% by weight ) , which gives it a grain resembling wood that is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure . Wrought iron is tough , malleable , ductile , corrosion-resistant and easily welded . Before the development of effective methods of steelmaking and the availability of large quantities of steel , wrought iron was the most common form of malleable iron . It was given the name wrought because it was hammered , rolled or otherwise worked while hot enough to expel molten slag . [ note 1 ] The modern functional equivalent of wrought iron is mild steel , also called low-carbon steel . Neither wrought iron nor mild steel contain enough carbon to be hardenable by heating and quenching . :145 Wrought iron is highly refined , with a small amount of slag forged out into fibres . It consists of around 99.4% iron by mass . The presence of slag is beneficial for blacksmithing operations , and gives the material its unique fibrous structure . The silicate filaments of the slag also protect the iron from corrosion and diminish the effect of fatigue caused by shock and vibration . Historically , a modest amount of wrought iron was refined into steel , which was used mainly to produce swords , cutlery , chisels , axes and other edged tools as well as springs and files .",
  "/wiki/Portland_stone": "Portland Stone or Portland Stone Formation is a limestone formation from the Tithonian stage of the Jurassic period quarried on the Isle of Portland , Dorset . The quarries are cut in beds of white-grey limestone separated by chert beds . It has been used extensively as a building stone throughout the British Isles , notably in major public buildings in London such as St Paul 's Cathedral and Buckingham Palace . Portland Stone is also exported to many countries - being used for example in the United Nations headquarters building in New York City .",

  "/wiki/Timber_framing": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers , creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs . It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century . If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered , and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect . The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany . Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast . The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber . Hewing this with broadaxes , adzes , and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers ( brace and bit ) and other woodworking tools , artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building . Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world , many styles of historic framing have developed . These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation , walls , how and where the beams intersect , the use of curved timbers , and the roof framing details .",
  "/wiki/Plinth": "A pedestal ( from French pi\u00e9destal , Italian piedistallo , foot of a stall ) or plinth is the support of a statue or a vase , and of a column in architecture . Smaller pedestals , especially if round in shape may be called socles . An elevated pedestal or plinth which bears a statue and which is raised from the substructure supporting it ( typically roofs or corniches ) is sometimes called an acropodium . The term is from the Greek akros or topmost and pous ( root pod- ) or foot .",

  "/wiki/Wigan": "Wigan ( /\u02c8w\u026a\u0261\u0259n/ WIG-\u0259n ) is a town in Greater Manchester , England , on the River Douglas , 10 miles ( 16 km ) south-west of Bolton , 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of Warrington and 17 miles ( 27.4 km ) west-northwest of Manchester . Wigan is the largest settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan and is its administrative centre . The town has a population of 103,608 , whilst the wider borough has a population of 318,100 . Historically in Lancashire , Wigan during classical antiquity was in the territory of the Brigantes , an ancient Celtic tribe that ruled much of what is now northern England . The Brigantes were subjugated in the Roman conquest of Britain during the 1st century , and it is asserted that the Roman settlement of Coccium was established where Wigan lies . Wigan is believed to have been incorporated as a borough in 1246 following the issue of a charter by King Henry III of England . At the end of the Middle Ages , it was one of four boroughs in Lancashire established by Royal charter . During the Industrial Revolution Wigan experienced dramatic economic expansion and a rapid rise in population . Although porcelain manufacture and clock making had been major industries , Wigan became known as a major mill town and coal mining district . A coal mine was recorded in 1450 and at its peak , there were 1,000 pit shafts within 5 miles ( 8 km ) of the town centre . Mining was so extensive that a town councillor remarked that a coal mine in the backyard was not uncommon in Wigan . Coal mining ceased during the latter part of the 20th century .",
  "/wiki/Greater_Manchester": "Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county and combined authority area in North West England , with a population of 2.8 million ; the third largest in England after Greater London and the West Midlands . It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs : Bolton , Bury , Oldham , Rochdale , Stockport , Tameside , Trafford , Wigan , and the cities of Manchester and Salford . Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , and designated a functional city region on 1 April 2011 . Greater Manchester spans 493 square miles ( 1,277 km2 ) , which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area , the second most populous urban area in the UK . It is landlocked and borders Cheshire ( to the south-west and south ) , Derbyshire ( to the south-east ) , West Yorkshire ( to the north-east ) , Lancashire ( to the north ) and Merseyside ( to the west ) . There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry . It has a focused central business district , formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford , but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . Greater Manchester is governed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) , which consists of political leaders from each of the ten metropolitan borough councils , plus a directly elected mayor , with responsibility for economic development , regeneration and transport . Andy Burnham is the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester , elected in 2017 . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) effectively became unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county , with a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff .",
  "/wiki/Tudor_Revival_architecture": "Tudor Revival architecture ( also known as mock Tudor in the UK ) first manifested itself in domestic architecture in the United Kingdom in the latter half of the 19th century . Based on revival of aspects that were perceived as Tudor architecture , in reality it usually took the style of English vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages that had survived into the Tudor period . The style later became an influence elsewhere , especially the British colonies . For example , in New Zealand , the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate . In Singapore , then a British colony , architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House . The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey , in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design . Tudorbethan is a subset of Tudor Revival architecture that eliminated some of the more complex aspects of Jacobethan in favor of more domestic styles of Merrie England , which were cosier and quaint . It was associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144 .",
