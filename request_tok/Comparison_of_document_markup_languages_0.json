  "/wiki/Markup_language": "In computer text processing , a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text , meaning when the document is processed for display , the markup language is not shown , and is only used to format the text . The idea and terminology evolved from the marking up of paper manuscripts ( i.e. , the revision instructions by editors ) , which is traditionally written with a red or blue pencil on authors ' manuscripts . Such markup typically includes both content corrections ( such as spelling , punctuation , or movement of content ) , and also typographic instructions , such as to make a heading larger or boldface . In digital media , this blue pencil instruction text was replaced by tags which ideally indicate what the parts of the document are , rather than details of how they might be shown on some display . This lets authors avoid formatting every instance of the same kind of thing redundantly ( and possibly inconsistently ) . It also avoids the specification of fonts and dimensions which may not apply to many users ( such as those with different-size displays , impaired vision and screen-reading software ) . Early markup systems typically included typesetting instructions , as troff , TeX and LaTeX do , while Scribe and most modern markup systems name components , and later process those names to apply formatting or other processing , as in the case of XML . Some markup languages , such as the widely used HTML , have pre-defined presentation semantics - meaning that their specification prescribes some aspects of how to present the structured data on particular media . HTML , like DocBook , Open eBook , JATS and countless others , is a specific application of the markup meta-languages SGML and XML . That is , SGML and XML enable users to specify particular schemas , which determine just what elements , attributes , and other features are permitted , and where . One extremely important characteristic of most markup languages is that they allow mixing markup directly into text streams . This happens all the time in documents : A few words in a sentence must be emphasized , or identified as a proper name , defined term , or other special item .",

  "/wiki/XHTML": "eXtensible HyperText Markup Language ( XHTML ) is part of the family of XML markup languages . It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used HyperText Markup Language ( HTML ) , the language in which Web pages are formulated . While HTML , prior to HTML5 , was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language ( SGML ) , a flexible markup language framework , XHTML is an application of XML , a more restrictive subset of SGML . XHTML documents are well-formed and may therefore be parsed using standard XML parsers , unlike HTML , which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser . XHTML 1.0 became a World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) recommendation on January 26 , 2000 . XHTML 1.1 became a W3C recommendation on May 31 , 2001 . The standard known as XHTML5 is being developed as an XML adaptation of the HTML5 specification .",
  "/wiki/HTML": "Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML ) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser . It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) and scripting languages such as JavaScript . Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages . HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document . HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages . With HTML constructs , images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page . HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings , paragraphs , lists , links , quotes and other items . HTML elements are delineated by tags , written using angle brackets . Tags such as < img / > and < input / > directly introduce content into the page . Other tags such as < p > surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements . Browsers do not display the HTML tags , but use them to interpret the content of the page . HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript , which affects the behavior and content of web pages .",
  "/wiki/DocBook": "DocBook is a semantic markup language for technical documentation . It was originally intended for writing technical documents related to computer hardware and software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation . As a semantic language , DocBook enables its users to create document content in a presentation-neutral form that captures the logical structure of the content ; that content can then be published in a variety of formats , including HTML , XHTML , EPUB , PDF , man pages , Web help and HTML Help , without requiring users to make any changes to the source . In other words , when a document is written in DocBook format it becomes easily portable into other formats , rather than needing to be rewritten .",

PDF was standardized as ISO 32000 in 2008 , and no longer requires any royalties for its implementation . Today , PDF files may contain a variety of content besides flat text and graphics including logical structuring elements , interactive elements such as annotations and form-fields , layers , rich media ( including video content ) and three dimensional objects using U3D or PRC , and various other data formats .

  "/wiki/EPUB": "EPUB is an e-book file format that uses the .epub file extension . The term is short for electronic publication and is sometimes styled ePub . EPUB is supported by many e-readers , and compatible software is available for most smartphones , tablets , and computers . EPUB is a technical standard published by the International Digital Publishing Forum ( IDPF ) . It became an official standard of the IDPF in September 2007 , superseding the older Open eBook standard . The Book Industry Study Group endorses EPUB 3 as the format of choice for packaging content and has stated that the global book publishing industry should rally around a single standard . The EPUB format is implemented as an archive file consisting of HTML files carrying the content , along with images and other supporting files . EPUB is the most widely supported vendor-independent XML-based ( as opposed to PDF ) e-book format ; that is , it is supported by almost all hardware readers , except for Kindle .",
  "/wiki/Device_independent_file_format": "The device independent file format ( DVI ) is the output file format of the TeX typesetting program , designed by David R. Fuchs and implemented by Donald E. Knuth in 1982 . Unlike the TeX markup files used to generate them , DVI files are not intended to be human-readable ; they consist of binary data describing the visual layout of a document in a manner not reliant on any specific image format , display hardware or printer . DVI files are typically used as input to a second program ( called a DVI driver ) which translates DVI files to graphical data . For example , most TeX software packages include a program for previewing DVI files on a user 's computer display ; this program is a driver . Drivers are also used to convert from DVI to popular page description languages ( e.g . PostScript , PDF ) and for printing . TeX markup may be at least partially reverse-engineered from DVI files , although this process is unlikely to produce high-level constructs identical to those present in the original markup , especially if the original markup used high-level TeX extensions ( e.g . LaTeX ) . DVI differs from PostScript and PDF in that it does not support any form of font embedding . ( Both PostScript and PDF formats can either embed their fonts inside the documents , or reference external ones . ) For a DVI file to be printed or even properly previewed , the fonts it references must be already installed . Like PDF , DVI uses a limited sort of machine language with termination guarantees that is not a full , Turing-complete programming language like PostScript .",

When writing , the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in What You See Is What You Get word processors like Microsoft Word , LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages . The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document ( such as article , book , and letter ) , to stylise text throughout a document ( such as bold and italics ) , and to add citations and cross-references . A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file ( such as PDF or DVI ) suitable for printing or digital distribution . Within the typesetting system , its name is stylised as LaTeX . LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields , including mathematics , statistics , computer science , engineering , chemistry , physics , economics , linguistics , quantitative psychology , philosophy , and political science . It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials , such as Sanskrit and Greek . LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output , and is itself written in the TeX macro language . LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system , or as an intermediate format . In the latter role , for example , it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating DocBook and other XML-based formats to PDF . The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing , including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures , chapter and section headings , the inclusion of graphics , page layout , indexing and bibliographies . Like TeX , LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists , but even from early in its development , it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts , such as Arabic , Sanskrit and Chinese .",

  "/wiki/Postscript": "A postscript ( P.S . ) is an afterthought , thought that 's occurring after the letter has been written and signed . The term comes from the Latin post scriptum , an expression meaning written after ( which may be interpreted in the sense of that which comes after the writing ) . A postscript may be a sentence , a paragraph , or occasionally many paragraphs added , often hastily and incidentally , after the signature of a letter or ( sometimes ) the main body of an essay or book . In a book or essay , a more carefully composed addition ( e.g. , for a second edition ) is called an afterword . The word postscript has , poetically , been used to refer to any sort of addendum to some main work , even if it is not attached to a main work , as in S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard 's book titled Concluding Unscientific Postscript . Sometimes , when additional points are made after the first postscript , abbreviations such as PSS ( post-super-scriptum ) , PPS ( postquam-post-scriptum or post-post-scriptum ) and PPPS ( post-post-post-scriptum ) , and so on , ad infinitum are used , though only PPS has somewhat common usage .",

Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $ 1 million in fines , 35 years in prison , asset forfeiture , restitution , and supervised release . Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison . Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz , he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment , where he had hanged himself . In 2013 , Swartz was inducted posthumously into the Internet Hall of Fame .",

  "/wiki/TeX": "TeX ( /t\u025bx , t\u025bk/ , see below ) , stylized within the system as TeX , is a typesetting system ( or a formatting system ) which was designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978 . TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae ; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems . TeX is popular in academia , especially in mathematics , computer science , economics , engineering , linguistics , physics , statistics , and quantitative psychology . It has largely displaced Unix troff , [ b ] the other favored formatting system , in many Unix installations which use both for different purposes . It is also used for many other typesetting tasks , especially in the form of LaTeX , ConTeXt , and other macro packages . TeX was designed with two main goals in mind : to allow anybody to produce high-quality books with minimal effort , and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers , at any point in time ( together with the Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces ) . TeX is free software , which made it accessible to a wide range of users .",
  "/wiki/Word_processor": "A word processor ( WP ) is a device or computer program that provides for input , editing , formatting and output of text , often with some additional features . Early word processors were stand-alone devices dedicated to the function , but current word processors are word processor programs running on general purpose computers . The functions of a word processor program fall somewhere between those of a simple text editor and a fully functioned desktop publishing program . However the distinctions between these three have changed over time , and were unclear after 2010 .",
  "/wiki/Music_Encoding_Initiative": "The Music Encoding Initiative ( MEI ) is an open-source effort to create a system for representation of musical documents in a machine-readable structure . MEI closely mirrors work done by text scholars in the Text Encoding Initiative ( TEI ) and while the two encoding initiatives are not formally related , they share many common characteristics and development practices . The term MEI , like TEI , describes the governing organization and the markup language . The MEI community solicits input and development directions from specialists in various music research communities , including technologists , librarians , historians , and theorists in a common effort to discuss and define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures . The results of these discussions are then formalized into the MEI schema , a core set of rules for recording physical and intellectual characteristics of music notation documents . This schema is expressed in an XML Schema Language , with RelaxNG being the preferred format . The MEI schema is developed using the One-Document-Does-it-all ( ODD ) format , a literate programming XML format developed by the Text Encoding Initiative . MEI is often used for music metadata catalogs , critical editing ( particularly of early music ) , and OMR-based data collection and interchange . MEI uses permissive software licence ; the Educational Community License , Version 2.0 , ( related to the Apache license , 2.0 ) .

  "/wiki/Office_suite": "Productivity software ( also called personal productivity software or office productivity software ) is application software used for producing information ( such as documents , presentations , worksheets , databases , charts , graphs , digital paintings , electronic music and digital video ) . Its names arose from the fact that it increases productivity , especially of individual office workers , from typists to knowledge workers , although its scope is now wider than that . Office suites , which brought word processing , spreadsheet , and relational database programs to the desktop in the 1980s , are the core example of productivity software . They revolutionized the office with the magnitude of the productivity increase they brought as compared with the pre-1980s office environments of typewriters , paper filing , and handwritten lists and ledgers . In the United States , some 78% of middle-skill occupations ( those that call for more than a high school diploma but less than a bachelor 's degree ) now require the use of productivity software . In the 2010s , productivity software has become even more consumerized than it already was , as computing becomes ever more integrated into daily personal life .",

The name is used to encompass plain text files ( org files ) that include simple marks to indicate levels of a hierarchy ( such as the outline of an essay , a topic list with subtopics , nested computer code , etc . ) , and an editor with functions that can read the markup and manipulate hierarchy elements ( expand/hide elements , move blocks of elements , check off to-do list items , etc. ) . Org-mode was created by Carsten Dominik in 2003 , originally to organize his own life and work , and since the first release numerous other users and developers have contributed to this free software package . Emacs includes Org-mode as a major mode by default . Bastien Guerry is the current maintainer , in cooperation with an active development community . Since its success in Emacs , some other systems have also begun providing functions to work with org files . Almost orthogonally , Org-mode has functionalities aimed at executing code in various external languages ; these functionalities form org-babel .",
  "/wiki/Emacs": "Emacs /\u02c8i\u02d0m\u00e6ks/ or EMACS ( Editor MACroS ) is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility . The manual for the most widely used variant , GNU Emacs , describes it as the extensible , customizable , self-documenting , real-time display editor . Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s , and work on its direct descendant , GNU Emacs , continues actively as of 2020 [ update ] . Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands and its user interface allows the user to combine these commands into macros to automate work . Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the Lisp programming language that provides a deep extension capability , allowing users and developers to write new commands and applications for the editor . Extensions have been written to manage email , files , outlines , and RSS feeds , as well as clones of ELIZA , Pong , Conway 's Life , Snake and Tetris . The original EMACS was written in 1976 by Carl Mikkelsen , David A . Moon and Guy L. Steele Jr. as a set of Editor MACroS for the TECO editor . It was inspired by the ideas of the TECO-macro editors TECMAC and TMACS . The most popular , and most ported , version of Emacs is GNU Emacs , which was created by Richard Stallman for the GNU Project . XEmacs is a variant that branched from GNU Emacs in 1991 . GNU Emacs and XEmacs use similar Lisp dialects and are for the most part compatible with each other .",
  "/wiki/FreeMind": "FreeMind is a free mind mapping application written in Java . FreeMind is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 . It provides extensive export capabilities . It runs on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS via the Java Runtime Environment . As with other mind mapping software packages , FreeMind allows the user to edit a hierarchical set of ideas around a central concept . The non-linear approach assists in brainstorming new outlines and projects as ideas are added around the mind map . As a Java application , FreeMind is portable across multiple platforms and retains the same user interface , causing some amount of variation from the common interface on each platform . Mac users may notice the most difference from their traditional user interface , but a MacWorld reviewer says the software 's features should still appeal to the segment of users who accept function over form . FreeMind was a finalist for Best Project in SourceForge.net 's Community Choice Awards for 2008 , which featured open-source software projects ."
