It originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the Royal Navy . Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head , who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron . The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral , who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle . In the rear of the naval squadron , a third admiral would command the remaining ships and , as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger , the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals . This has survived into the modern age , with the rank of rear admiral the most-junior of the admiralty ranks of many navies . In some European navies ( e.g. , that of France ) , and in the Canadian Forces ' French rank translations , the rank of rear admiral is known as contre-amiral .
