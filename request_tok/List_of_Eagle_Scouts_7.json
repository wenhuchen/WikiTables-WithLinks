Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating . Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use , or for production of weapons-grade plutonium .

He began as an advance man on President Dwight D. Eisenhower 's reelection campaign in 1956 , again worked as an advance man on Nixon 's 1960 presidential campaign , and managed Nixon 's 1962 run for Governor of California .

Haldeman is credited with implementing more significant changes to White House staffing systems and Executive Branch governance and operations than any Chief of Staff before him or since , and it is the Haldeman system that presidential administrations continue to operate on today . His intensity and no-nonsense management style earned him a reputation as a stern taskmaster who expected top-notch performance . After he left the Nixon administration in April 1973 , Haldeman was tried on counts of perjury , conspiracy , and obstruction of justice for his role in the Watergate cover-up .
