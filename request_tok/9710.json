  "/wiki/Operation_Crossroads": "Operation Crossroads was a pair of nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946 . They were the first nuclear weapon tests since Trinity in July 1945 , and the first detonations of nuclear devices since the atomic bombing of Nagasaki on August 9 , 1945 . The purpose of the tests was to investigate the effect of nuclear weapons on warships . The Crossroads tests were the first of many nuclear tests held in the Marshall Islands , and the first to be publicly announced beforehand and observed by an invited audience , including a large press corps . They were conducted by Joint Army/Navy Task Force One , headed by Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy rather than by the Manhattan Project , which had developed nuclear weapons during World War II . A fleet of 95 target ships was assembled in Bikini Lagoon and hit with two detonations of Fat Man plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapons of the kind dropped on Nagasaki , each with a yield of 23 kilotons of TNT ( 96 TJ ) . The first test was Able . The bomb was named Gilda after Rita Hayworth 's character in the 1946 film Gilda , and was dropped from the B-29 Superfortress Dave 's Dream of the 509th Bombardment Group on July 1 , 1946 . It detonated 520 feet ( 158 m ) above the target fleet and caused less than the expected amount of ship damage because it missed its aim point by 2,130 feet ( 649 m ) . The second test was Baker . The bomb was known as Helen of Bikini and was detonated 90 feet ( 27 m ) underwater on July 25 , 1946 . Radioactive sea spray caused extensive contamination .",

  "/wiki/Operation_Greenhouse": "Operation Greenhouse was the fifth American nuclear test series , the second conducted in 1951 and the first to test principles that would lead to developing thermonuclear weapons ( hydrogen bombs ) . Conducted at the new Pacific Proving Ground , on islands of the Enewetak Atoll , all of the devices were mounted in large steel towers , to simulate air bursts . This series of nuclear weapons tests was preceded by Operation Ranger and succeeded by Operation Buster-Jangle . Operation Greenhouse showcased new and aggressive designs for nuclear weapons . The main idea was to reduce the size , weight , and most importantly , reduce the amount of fissile material necessary for nuclear weapons , while increasing the destructive power . With the Soviet Union 's first nuclear test a year and half earlier , the United States had begun stockpiling the new designs before they were actually proven . Thus the success of Operation Greenhouse was vital before the development of thermonuclear weapons could continue . A number of target buildings , including bunkers , houses and factories were built on Mujinkarikku Islet to test nuclear weapon effects .",

In 1999 , U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as United States Joint Forces Command . USLANTCOM was active from the 1947 to 1993 as a primarily U.S. Navy command , focused upon the wartime defense of the Atlantic sea lanes against Soviet attack , with the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and other subunified commands such as the Iceland Defense Force under its authority . The Navy 's leading place within the command had been marked by having Commander-in-Chief U.S. Atlantic Fleet , CINCLANTFLT acting also as the Commander-in-Chief United States Atlantic Command between 1947 and 1985 . CINCLANTFLT , in addition to the LANTCOM post , also held the position of NATO 's Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic ( SACLANT ) . There were also Army and Air Force components , CINCARLANT and CINCAFLANT ; these posts were allocated to Commanding General , CONARC , and Commander , Tactical Air Command , during the Cuban Missile Crisis . The beginning of the Congo Crisis in mid 1960 shift planners ' attention to potential tasks in Central Africa . In November 1960 , the Secretary of Defense gave CINCLANT the responsibility for sub-Saharan Africa plans and operations , and instructed CINCLANT to establish a small headquarters , Joint Task Force 4 , under an Army lieutenant general . Lieutenant General Louis W. Truman served as Commander JTF-4 . Several months later , in response to a JCS request , Secretary Robert S. McNamara changed the Unified Command Plan 's wording so that CINCLANT no longer bore responsibility for routine matters in sub-Saharan Africa but was , instead , responsible for contingency planning and for commanding any JCS-directed operations . In July 1961 Secretary McNamara apportioned sub-Saharan responsibilities as follows : Military Assistance Program ( MAP ) to USCINCEUR and the Secretary of the Army , Congo air evacuation to USCINCEUR , and the Congo sea evacuation to CINCLANT . After the end of the Cold War , a 1993 reorganization gave the Command a new acronym , USACOM , and brought United States Army Forces Command and Air Combat Command under its authority .",

The confrontation is often considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale nuclear war . In response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961 and the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey , Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to Cuba 's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion . An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Fidel Castro in July 1962 , and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer . Meanwhile , the 1962 United States elections were under way , and the White House had for months denied charges that it was ignoring dangerous Soviet missiles 90 miles ( 140 km ) from Florida . The missile preparations were confirmed when an Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range ( SS-4 ) and intermediate-range ( R-14 ) ballistic missile facilities . The US established a naval blockade on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba ; Oval Office tapes during the crisis revealed that Kennedy had also put the blockade in place , as an attempt to provoke Soviet-backed forces in Berlin as well . The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union . After several days of tense negotiations , an agreement was reached between US President John F. Kennedy and Khrushchev . Publicly , the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union , subject to United Nations verification , in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again . Secretly , the United States agreed that it would dismantle all US-built Jupiter MRBMs , which had been deployed in Turkey against the Soviet Union ; there has been debate on whether or not Italy was included in the agreement as well .",

They differed from Crossroads in that they were conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission , with the armed forces having only a supporting role . The purpose of the Sandstone tests was also different : they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of the effects of nuclear weapons . Three tests were carried out in April and May 1948 by Joint Task Force 7 , with a work force of 10,366 personnel , of whom 9,890 were military . The successful testing of the new cores in the Operation Sandstone tests rendered every component of the old weapons obsolete . Even before the third test had been carried out , production of the old cores was halted , and all effort concentrated on the new Mark 4 nuclear bomb , which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon . More efficient use of fissionable material as a result of Operation Sandstone would increase the U.S. nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949 .",

The operation involved some 75,000 troops and 261 naval vessels , and led to the recapture of the South Korean capital of Seoul two weeks later . The code name for the operation was Operation Chromite . The battle began on 15 September 1950 and ended on 19 September . Through a surprise amphibious assault far from the Pusan Perimeter that UN and Republic of Korea Army ( ROK ) forces were desperately defending , the largely undefended city of Incheon was secured after being bombed by UN forces . The battle ended a string of victories over the Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) . The subsequent UN recapture of Seoul partially severed the KPA 's supply lines in South Korea . The UN and ROK forces were commanded by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur of the United States Army .

It followed Operation Upshot-Knothole and preceded Operation Teapot . Conducted as a joint venture between the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) and the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , the ultimate objective of the operation was to test designs for an aircraft-deliverable thermonuclear weapon . Operation Castle was considered by government officials to be a success as it proved the feasibility of deployable dry fuel designs for thermonuclear weapons . There were technical difficulties with some of the tests : one device had a yield much lower than predicted ( a fizzle ) , while two other bombs detonated with over twice their predicted yields . One test in particular , Castle Bravo , resulted in extensive radiological contamination . The fallout affected nearby islands including inhabitants and U.S. soldiers stationed there , as well as a nearby Japanese fishing boat ( the Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru ) , resulting in one direct fatality , and then continued health problems for many of those exposed . Public reaction to the tests and an awareness of the long-range effects of nuclear fallout has been attributed as being part of the motivation for the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963 .",

  "/wiki/Doolittle_Raid": "The Doolittle Raid , also known as the Tokyo Raid , was an air raid on 18 April 1942 by the United States on the Japanese capital Tokyo and other places on Honshu during World War II . It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago . It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attack , served as retaliation for the attack on Pearl Harbor , and provided an important boost to American morale . The raid was planned , led by , and named after Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle , later General of the United States Army Air Forces . Sixteen B-25B Mitchell medium bombers were launched without fighter escort from the U.S. Navy 's aircraft carrier USS Hornet deep in the Western Pacific Ocean , each with a crew of five men . The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan and to continue westward to land in China . The bombing raid killed about 50 people , including civilians , and injured 400 . Fifteen aircraft reached China but all crashed , while the 16th landed at Vladivostok in the Soviet Union . Of the 80 crew members , 77 survived the mission . Eight airmen were captured by Japanese Army in China ; three were later executed . The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year before being allowed to escape via Soviet-occupied Iran with the help of the NKVD .
