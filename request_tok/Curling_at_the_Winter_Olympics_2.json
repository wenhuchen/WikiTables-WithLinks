  "/wiki/China_at_the_Olympics": "Originally having participated in Olympics as the delegation of the Republic of China ( ROC ) from 1924 ( Summer Olympics ) to 1976 ( Winter Olympics ) , China competed at the Olympic Games under the name of the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) for the first time in 1952 , at the Summer Games in Helsinki , Finland , although they only arrived in time to participate in one event . That year , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) allowed both the PRC and the Republic of China ( which recently relocated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War ) to compete , although the latter withdrew in protest . Due to the dispute over the political status of China , the PRC did not participate in the Olympics again until the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid , United States . Their first appearance at the Summer Olympic Games after 1952 was the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles , United States . The Chinese Olympic Committee in its current form was recognized in 1979 . Before the Chinese Civil War , athletes competed as the Republic of China ( ROC ) at the Olympics . The ROC continued to compete from 1952 ( Summer Olympics ) to 1976 ( Winter Olympics ) , but only representing athletes from the island of Taiwan ( although the football team members of ROC in the 1960 Olympic Games were overwhelmingly Hong Kongers ) . The dispute over use of the name China resulted in the PRC boycotting the Games completely during these years . In 1979 , the International Olympic Committee passed a resolution for the ROC team to be designated Chinese Taipei , and this opened the door for the PRC to finally join the Olympic movement . Hong Kong has had a distinct National Olympic Committee since 1950 and has competed at the Games since 1952 . After the territory was returned to the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was created in 1997 , this arrangement has continued , with Hong Kong competing independently from the rest of the nation under the name Hong Kong , China .",
