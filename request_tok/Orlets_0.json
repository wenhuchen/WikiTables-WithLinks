  "/wiki/Soyuz-U": "The Soyuz-U launch vehicle was an improved version of the original Soyuz rocket . Soyuz-U was part of the R-7 family of rockets based on the R-7 Semyorka missile . Members of this rocket family were designed by the TsSKB design bureau and constructed at the Progress Factory in Samara , Russia ( now a united company , TsSKB-Progress ) . The first Soyuz-U flight took place on 18 May 1973 , carrying as its payload Kosmos 559 , a Zenit military surveillance satellite . The final flight of a Soyuz-U rocket took place on February 22 , 2017 , carrying Progress MS-05 to the International Space Station . Soyuz-U was in use continuously for almost 44 years . Production of R-7 derived launch vehicles peaked in the late 1970s-early 1980s at 55-60 a year . Soyuz-U held the world record of highest launch rate in a year in 1979 with 47 flights . Over its operational lifetime , the Soyuz-U variant flew a total of 786 missions , another world record . Soyuz-U has also been one of the most reliable launchers , with a success rate of 97.3% .",

  "/wiki/Soyuz-U2": "The Soyuz-U2 ( GRAU index 11A511U2 ) was a Soviet , later Russian , carrier rocket . It was derived from the Soyuz-U , and a member of the R-7 family of rockets . It featured increased performance compared with the baseline Soyuz-U , due to the use of syntin propellant , as opposed to RP-1 paraffin , used on the Soyuz-U . The increased payload of the Soyuz-U2 allowed heavier spacecraft to be launched , while lighter spacecraft could be placed in higher orbits , compared to those launched by Soyuz-U rockets . In 1996 , it was announced that the Soyuz-U2 had been retired , as the performance advantage gained through the use of syntin did not justify the additional cost of its production . The final flight , Soyuz TM-22 , occurred on 3 September 1995 from Gagarin 's Start in Baikonur . The Soyuz-U2 was first used to launch four Zenit reconnaissance satellites , then it delivered crewed Soyuz spacecraft to space stations Salyut 7 and Mir : missions Soyuz T-12 to T-15 and Soyuz TM-1 to TM-22 . It also supplied the stations with Progress cargo spacecraft : Progress 20 to Salyut 7 , Progress 25 to 42 to Mir , followed by the new generation Progress M-1 to M-18 and finally M-23 . Other missions included the Gamma telescope and three Orlets reconnaissance satellites . In total , Soyuz-U2 was launched 72 times and experienced no failures over its operational lifetime .",
  "/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Site_31": "Baikonur Site 31 , also known as Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome , in Kazakhstan , is a launch site used by derivatives of the R-7 Semyorka missile . From 2011 onwards , it was supposed to be the launch site for manned Soyuz missions to the International Space Station , when launches switched from the Soyuz-FG carrier rocket to the Soyuz-2 , which was unable to use the launch pad at Site 1/5 . However , Site 1/5 has undergone modifications that allow the manned ISS missions to be launched from it . Only few manned missions to the International Space Station are launched from Site 31/6 ( Soyuz TMA-06M , Soyuz TMA-15M , Soyuz MS-02 ) , when Site 1/5 is unavailable . It was first used on 14 January 1961 , for an R-7A ICBM test mission . It is currently used for commercial Soyuz-FG/Fregat missions , and Soyuz-2 launches . In the 1970s and early 1980s , several manned missions were launched from the site .",
  "/wiki/Zenit-2": "The Zenit-2 is a Russian-Ukrainian , previously Soviet , expendable carrier rocket . First flown in 1985 , it has been launched 37 times , with 6 failures . It is a member of the Zenit family of rockets and was designed by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau .",
  "/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Site_45": "Site 45 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome is a launch site used by Zenit rockets . It consists of two pads , one of which is still in use . It has been the launch site for all Soviet and Russian government Zenit launches , along with a commercial launch conducted for Globalstar in 1998 , and continuing commercial launches under the Land Launch programme . The main pad at the site is area 45/1 , which was completed in 1983 following five years of construction . A second pad , area 45/2 , was completed in 1990 , but was destroyed by a launch failure in the same year . The first launch from site 45 , using pad 1 , occurred on 13 April 1985 . This was a sub-orbital test flight of the Zenit-2 , and the maiden flight of the Zenit rocket . The launch failed , and was followed up with a second , successful , test flight launched at 08:21 GMT on 21 June 1985 . Whilst this launch was also intended to be suborbital , some debris from the launch reached low Earth orbit . The first launch from pad 2 occurred on 22 May 1990 , when a Zenit-2 successfully orbited a Tselina-2 ELINT satellite . On the next launch , also from pad 2 , the first stage RD-171 engine failed five seconds after launch and the rocket fell back onto the launch pad from a height of about 70 metres ( 230 ft ) . The resulting explosion completely destroyed the launch pad , and was reported to have lifted a 1,000 tonne metal structure 20 metres into the air , and to have caused significant damage to lighting towers 100 metres from the pad ."
