During the American Revolutionary War , the provisional government of the Virginia Colony authorized the purchase , outfitting , and manning of armed vessels to protect the colony 's waters from threats posed it by the Royal Navy . Early in the American Civil War , after the state of Virginia seceded from the Union on April 17 , 1861 , it briefly had naval forces of its own ; these were eventually adopted by the Confederate States Navy .",
  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",
  "/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America": "The Confederate States of America ( CSA or C.S . ) - commonly referred to as the Confederacy - was an unrecognized republic in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865 . The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states - South Carolina , Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas - in the Lower South region of the United States , whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture , particularly cotton , and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves . Convinced that the institution of slavery was threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories , the Confederacy declared its secession in rebellion against the United States , with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War . Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and normal condition . Before Lincoln took office in March , a new Confederate government was established in February 1861 which was considered illegal by the government of the United States . States volunteered militia units , and the new government hastened to form its own Confederate States Army from nothing practically overnight . After the American Civil War began in April , four slave states of the Upper South - Virginia , Arkansas , Tennessee , and North Carolina - also seceded and joined the Confederacy . The Confederacy later accepted Missouri and Kentucky as members , although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces ; Confederate shadow governments attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them . The government of the United States ( the Union ) rejected the claims of secession , considering it illegitimate . The war began April 12 , 1861 , when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter , a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina . No foreign government ever officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country , although Great Britain and France granted it belligerent status , which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies .",

  "/wiki/Admiral": "Admiral is one of the highest ranks in some navies , and in many navies is the highest rank .

  "/wiki/United_States_Maritime_Commission": "The United States Maritime Commission ( MARCOM ) was an independent executive agency of the U.S. federal government that was created by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 , passed by Congress on June 29 , 1936 , and replaced the United States Shipping Board which had existed since World War I . It was intended to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and build five hundred modern merchant cargo ships to replace the World War I vintage vessels that comprised the bulk of the United States Merchant Marine , and to administer a subsidy system authorized by the Act to offset the cost differential between building in the U.S. and operating ships under the American flag . It also formed the United States Maritime Service for the training of seagoing ship 's officers to man the new fleet . As a symbol of the rebirth of the U.S . Merchant Marine and Merchant Shipbuilding under the Merchant Marine Act , the first vessel contracted for was SS America . Owned by the United States Lines , she briefly operated in the passenger liner and cruise service before being converted into a high-speed transport , per her design . From 1939 through the end of World War II , the Maritime Commission funded and administered the largest and most successful merchant shipbuilding effort in world history , producing thousands of ships , including Liberty ships , Victory ships , and others , notably Type C1 , Type C2 , Type C3 , Type C4 freighters and T2 tankers . By the end of the war , U.S. shipyards working under Maritime Commission contracts had built a total of 5,777 oceangoing merchant and naval ships . A huge postwar contraction followed , with massive sell-offs to foreign militaries and commercial fleets . The last major shipbuilding project undertaken by the Commission was to oversee the design and construction of the super passenger liner SS United States which was intended to be both a symbol of American technological might and maritime predominance but also could be quickly converted into the world 's fastest naval troop transport . The Maritime Commission was abolished on 24 May 1950 , and its functions were divided between the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission which was responsible for regulating shipping trades and trade routes and the United States Maritime Administration , which was responsible for administering the construction and operating subsidy programs , maintaining NDRF , and operating the U.S .

  "/wiki/Destroyer": "In naval terminology , a destroyer is a fast , maneuverable , long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet , convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers . They were originally developed in the late 19th century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats , and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 , these torpedo boat destroyers ( TBDs ) were large , swift , and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats . Although the term destroyer had been used interchangeably with TBD and torpedo boat destroyer by navies since 1892 , the term torpedo boat destroyer had been generally shortened to simply destroyer by nearly all navies by the First World War . Before World War II , destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations ; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together . After the war , the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers . This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation . At the start of the 21st century , destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships , with only two nations ( United States and Russia ) operating the heavier class cruisers , with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining . Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era , and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . At 510 feet ( 160 m ) long , a displacement of 9,200 tons , and with armament of more than 90 missiles , guided missile destroyers such as the Arleigh Burke-class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers . Some European navies , such as the French , Spanish , Dutch or German , use the term frigate for their destroyers , which leads to some confusion . After the Second World War , destroyers grew in size . The Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer had a displacement of 2200 tons , while the Arleigh Burke class has a displacement of up to 9600 tons , thus growing in size almost 340% .",

  "/wiki/Cold_War": "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies , the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc , after World War II . The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union . The term cold is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers , but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars . The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers , following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 . Whilst the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc generally espoused the economic theories of capitalism and socialism , respectively , the conflict was mostly geopolitical in nature . Each power had a nuclear strategy that discouraged a pre-emptive attack by the other side , on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker - the doctrine of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) . Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment , the struggle for dominance was expressed via psychological warfare , massive propaganda campaigns and espionage , far-reaching embargoes , rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race . The West was led by the United States , a federal republic with a two-party presidential system , as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but economically and politically entwined with a network of authoritarian states , most of which were the Western Bloc 's former colonies . [ A ] The Soviet Union was a self-declared Marxist-Leninist state that had a totalitarian government ultimately led by a committee known as the Politburo . The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) had influence across the Second World . The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world , while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world .
