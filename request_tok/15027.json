  "/wiki/Benicia_Arsenal": "The Benicia Arsenal ( 1851-1964 ) and Benicia Barracks ( 1852-66 ) were part of a large military reservation located next to Suisun Bay in Benicia , California . For over 100 years , the arsenal was the primary US Army Ordnance facility for the West Coast of the United States . In 1847 a 252-acre ( 102 ha ) parcel of land adjoining the Benicia city limits on the east was acquired for a military reserve . First occupation of the post was on April 9 , 1849 , when two companies of the 2nd Infantry Regiment set up camp to establish Benicia Barracks , which also housed the 3rd Artillery Regiment . In 1851 , after the urging of General Persifor F. Smith , the first Ordnance Supply Depot in the West was established in Benicia . In 1852 it was designated Benicia Arsenal . Notable military personnel who were stationed there during this time include Ulysses Grant , Edward Ord , and Joseph Hooker , among others . The grounds of the Benicia Arsenal are also famous for stabling one of the elements of the Army 's Camel Corps . The short-lived Camel Corps was disbanded in 1863 , but the Camel Barns , built in 1855 , remain and are now the Benicia Historical Museum . The Benicia Arsenal was a staging area during the Civil War for Union troops from the West , and the installation remained a garrisoned post until 1898 when troops were assigned to duty in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War . During World War I , the Benicia Arsenal gave ordnance support to all large Army installations in the Western States as well as supplying Ordnance material to American expeditionary forces in Siberia . Italian Service Units of the 4th , 4th and 50th Italian Quartermaster Service Company worked at the Arsenal during World War 2 .",
  "/wiki/Interstate_680_(California)": "Interstate 680 ( I-680 ) is a major north-south auxiliary Interstate Highway in Northern California . It curves around the eastern cities of the San Francisco Bay Area from San Jose to Interstate 80 at Fairfield , bypassing cities along the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay such as Oakland and Richmond while serving others more inland such as Pleasanton and Concord . Built in the 1920s and designated in 1955 , I-680 begins at a junction with I-280 and US 101 ( Bayshore Freeway ) , and heads northeast and north-northwest through the northeast part of San Jose . After passing State Route 237 ( SR 237 ) in Milpitas and SR 262 in Fremont , I-680 abruptly turns northeast ( where a connection to a SR 238 freeway was planned ) and enters the hills and valleys of the California Coast Ranges . The highway crosses over Mission Pass , also known as the Sunol Grade , and descends into the Sunol Valley , where it meets SR 84 near Sunol . From Sunol , I-680 again heads north-northwesterly through valleys , including the San Ramon Valley , along the Calaveras Fault . Junctions along this portion include I-580 in Dublin and SR 24 in Walnut Creek . Beyond the latter interchange , a three-way directional junction with the SR 24 freeway west to Oakland , I-680 heads north into Pleasant Hill , where SR 242 splits and I-680 again heads northwesterly . After the junction with SR 4 in Martinez , the highway crosses the Carquinez Strait on the Benicia-Martinez Bridge , immediately meeting the east end of I-780 on the Benicia end . The remainder of I-680 , from Benicia to I-80 at Fairfield , lies between a hilly area to the west representing the southwestern tip of the Vaca Mountains , and a marshy area ( along the Suisun Bay and Cordelia Slough ) to the east .",
