  "intro": "References to Wikipedia in western culture have increased as more people learn about and use the online encyclopedia project. Many parody Wikipedia's openness, with individuals vandalizing or modifying articles in nonconstructive ways. Still, others feature individuals using Wikipedia as a reference work, or positively comparing their intelligence to Wikipedia. In some cases, Wikipedia is not used as an encyclopedia at all, but instead serves more as a character trait or even as a game. Wikipedia has also become culturally significant with many individuals seeing the presence of their own Wikipedia entry as a status symbol."
