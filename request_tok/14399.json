  "/wiki/Cannibal_Tours": "Cannibal Tours is a 1988 quasi-documentary film by Australian director and cinematographer Dennis O'Rourke . While it borrows heavily from ethnographic modes of representation , the film is a biting commentary on the nature of modernity . The film is also widely celebrated for its depiction of Western touristic desires and exploitation among a 'tribal ' people . The film follows a number of affluent European and American tourists and ecotourists as they travel from village to village along the middle Sepik River in Papua New Guinea . Most of the villages in the film are inhabited by the Iatmul people . The film shows the tourists driving hard bargains for local handcrafts such as woodcarvings and baskets , relentlessly taking photos of local people , handing out cigarettes , balloons , and perfume , viewing staged dance performances , and offering naive comments on native people living in harmony with nature . The film , too , tacks between the tourists and black-and-white photographs from the era of German colonialism of New Guinea ( 1880s-1914 ) . With some prodding , the tourists unwittingly reveal an unattractive and pervasive ethnocentrism to O'Rourke 's cameras . The tourists thus become somewhat dehumanized by the filmmaker 's camera even as they themselves dehumanize and exoticize even the most mundane aspects of Sepik River life . The title of the film can be read in at least a couple of ways . At one point early in the film , a German tourist , clearly titillated , describes the bygone practice of raiding and cannibalism . He is obsessed with cannibalism , asking local men about the former practice , and snapping photos of locations where local people once practiced headhunting ; other tourists also attempt to discuss the symbolic meaning of cannibalism .",

Celsius 41.11 performed less well at the box office than comparable left-leaning documentaries and significantly poorer than Fahrenheit 9/11 . The producer attributed this to voter fatigue and to a timetabling clash with the World Series . The critics ' response was described as irk [ ed ] by the BBC .
