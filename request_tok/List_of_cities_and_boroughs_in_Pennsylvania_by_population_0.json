Backup quarterback Nick Foles , who was widely underestimated and discredited by pre-game broadcasts , was the Eagles ' starting quarterback for the rest of the season . With Foles , the Eagles advanced to their third Super Bowl appearance , having previously lost to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XV and to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX .

  "/wiki/Liberty_Bell": "The Liberty Bell , previously called the State House Bell or Old State House Bell , is an iconic symbol of American independence , located in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Once placed in the steeple of the Pennsylvania State House ( now renamed Independence Hall ) , the bell today is located in the Liberty Bell Center in Independence National Historical Park . The bell was commissioned in 1752 by the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from the London firm of Lester and Pack ( known subsequently as the Whitechapel Bell Foundry ) , and was cast with the lettering Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof , a Biblical reference from the Book of Leviticus ( 25:10 ) . The bell first cracked when rung after its arrival in Philadelphia , and was twice recast by local workmen John Pass and John Stow , whose last names appear on the bell . In its early years , the bell was used to summon lawmakers to legislative sessions and to alert citizens about public meetings and proclamations . Although no immediate announcement was made of the Second Continental Congress 's vote for independence - and so the bell could not have rung on July 4 , 1776 , related to that vote - bells were rung on July 8 to mark the reading of the United States Declaration of Independence . While there is no contemporary account of the Liberty Bell ringing , most historians believe it was one of the bells rung . After American independence was secured , the bell fell into relative obscurity until , in the 1830s , the bell was adopted as a symbol by abolitionist societies , who dubbed it the Liberty Bell . The bell acquired its distinctive large crack some time in the early 19th century - a widespread story claims it cracked while ringing after the death of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835 . The bell became famous after an 1847 short story claimed that an aged bellringer rang it on July 4 , 1776 , upon hearing of the Second Continental Congress ' vote for independence . Despite the fact that the bell did not ring for independence on that July 4 , the tale was widely accepted as fact , even by some historians . Beginning in 1885 , the city of Philadelphia - which owns the bell - allowed it to go to various expositions and patriotic gatherings .",

The city features 30 skyscrapers , two inclined railways , a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers . The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest , as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires , Virginians , Whiskey Rebels , and Civil War raiders . Aside from steel , Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum , glass , shipbuilding , petroleum , foods , sports , transportation , computing , autos , and electronics . For part of the 20th century , Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment ; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita . Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 80s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined , and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out . The population dropped from a peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990 . However , this rich industrial history left the area with renowned museums , medical centers , parks , research centers , and a diverse cultural district .

New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century .

  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",

Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of Simon de Montfort , 6th Earl of Leicester , after de Montfort 's death and attainder at the end of the Second Barons ' War . When Edmund 's son Thomas , 2nd Earl of Lancaster , inherited his father-in-law 's estates and title of Earl of Lincoln he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England , with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels . This brought him - and Henry , his younger brother - into conflict with their cousin Edward II of England , leading to Thomas 's execution . Henry inherited Thomas 's titles and he and his son , who was also called Henry , gave loyal service to Edward 's son - Edward III of England . The second house of Lancaster was descended from John of Gaunt , who married the heiress of the first house , Blanche of Lancaster . Edward III married all his sons to wealthy English heiresses rather than following his predecessors ' practice of finding continental political marriages for royal princes . Henry of Grosmont , 1st Duke of Lancaster , had no male heir so Edward married his son John to Henry 's heiress daughter and John 's third cousin Blanche of Lancaster .

Penn was a writer , early member of the Religious Society of Friends ( Quakers ) , and founder of the English North American colony the Province of Pennsylvania . He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom , notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans . Under his direction , the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed . In 1681 , King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn 's father . This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware . Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil , sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River , ( past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies ) in New Castle ( now in Delaware ) in 1682 . On this occasion , the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor , and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held . Afterward , Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia , on the west bank . However , Penn 's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch , Swedish colonists , and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware , but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland 's proprietor family , the Calverts and Lord Baltimore . These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a Pennsylvania , so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly . 23 years later in 1704 , they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware , were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware .",

  "/wiki/American_Revolution": "The American Revolution was a colonial revolt which occurred between 1765 and 1783 . The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) with the assistance of France , winning independence from Great Britain and establishing the United States of America . The American colonials proclaimed no taxation without representation starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 . They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they had no representatives in that governing body . Protests steadily escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772 , followed by the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 . The British responded by closing Boston Harbor and enacting a series of punitive laws which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony 's rights of self-government . The other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts , and a group of American Patriot leaders set up their own government in late 1774 at the Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance of Britain ; other colonists retained their allegiance to the Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories . Tensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when King George 's forces attempted to destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 . The conflict then developed into war , during which the Patriots ( and later their French allies ) fought the British and Loyalists in the Revolutionary War . Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress which assumed power from the former colonial governments , suppressed Loyalism , and recruited a Continental Army led by General George Washington . The Continental Congress declared King George a tyrant who trampled the colonists ' rights as Englishmen , and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2 , 1776 . The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy , and they proclaimed that all men are created equal .",
  "/wiki/Continental_Congress": "The Continental Congress was initially a convention of delegates from a number of British American colonies at the height of the American Revolution , who acted collectively for the people of the Thirteen Colonies that ultimately became the United States of America . After declaring the colonies independent from the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1776 , it acted as the provisional governing structure for the collective United States , while most government functions remained in the individual states . The term most specifically refers to the First Continental Congress of 1774 and the Second Continental Congress of 1775-1781 . More broadly , it also refers to the Congress of the Confederation of 1781-1789 , thus covering the three congressional bodies of the Thirteen Colonies and the United States that met between 1774 and the inauguration of a new government in 1789 under the United States Constitution . Convened in response to the Intolerable Acts passed by the British Parliament in 1774 , the First Continental Congress sought to help repair the frayed relationship between the British government and its American colonies while also asserting the rights of colonists . The Second Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence in July 1776 , proclaiming that the 13 colonies were now independent sovereign states , no longer under British rule . This body functioned as the provisional government for the U.S. until the nation 's first Frame of Government , the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union , came into force on March 1 , 1781 , at which time it became the Congress of the Confederation . Officially styled The United States in Congress Assembled , this unicameral governing body would convene in eight sessions ( a ninth would fail to achieve a quorum ) prior to being disbanded in 1789 , when the 1st United States Congress under the new constitution took over the role as the nation 's legislative branch of government . Much of what is known today about the daily activities of these congresses comes from the journals kept by the secretary for all three congresses , Charles Thomson . Printed contemporaneously , the Papers of the Continental Congress contain the official congressional papers , letters , treaties , reports and records . The delegates to the Continental and Confederation congresses had extensive experience in deliberative bodies , with a cumulative total of nearly 500 years of experience in their Colonial assemblies , and fully a dozen of them had served as speakers of the houses of their legislatures .",

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country .

  "/wiki/Industrial_Revolution": "The Industrial Revolution , now also known as the First Industrial Revolution , was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States , in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840 . This transition included going from hand production methods to machines , new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes , the increasing use of steam power and water power , the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system . The Industrial Revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth . Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment , value of output and capital invested . The textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods . :40 The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain , and many of the technological innovations were of British origin . By the mid-18th century Britain was the world 's leading commercial nation , controlling a global trading empire with colonies in North America and the Caribbean , and with major military and political hegemony on the Indian subcontinent , particularly with the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal , through the activities of the East India Company . The development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the Industrial Revolution . :15 The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history ; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way . In particular , average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth . Some economists say that the major effect of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history , although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries . GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy , while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies .",
  "/wiki/Pennsylvania_Canal": "Pennsylvania Canal ( or sometimes Pennsylvania Canal system ) refers generally to a complex system of transportation infrastructure improvements including canals , dams , locks , tow paths , aqueducts , and viaducts .

[ notes 1 ] It should be understood the first use of any railway in North America was the year 1826 , [ notes 2 ] so the newspapers and the Pennsylvania Assembly of 1824 applied the term then to the proposed rights of way mainly for the canals of the Main Line of Public Works to be built across the southern part of Pennsylvania . Enacted while railroads were in their infancy , the focus of the act was to create through building a canal system , the capability to ship heavy or bulk goods and connect Philadelphia to Pittsburgh - and more importantly - and beyond to the new growth markets in the developing Northwest Territory reached by the Ohio River now called the midwest . [ notes 3 ] Later , when updated in 1837 to reflect the experience of twelve years of toddler-railways , [ notes 4 ] the term was also applied to railroads and new canals to be added to the state transportation system . As a crowning achievement , the Main Line of Public Works and the Pennsylvania Canal system topped 2,100 feet ( 640 m ) in elevation by erecting the Allegheny Portage Railroad , which used a system of five inclines and five planes on each side of the Eastern Continental Divide at Cresson Pass in Cambria County to actually haul wheeled flat cars , which had halved canal boats placed on them , up and over the Allegheny Front and connect Pittsburgh to the Susquehanna .

  "/wiki/Urban_decentralization": "Urban sprawl or suburban sprawl mainly refers to the unrestricted growth in many urban areas of housing , commercial development , and roads over large expanses of land , with little concern for urban planning . In addition to describing a particular form of urbanization , the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development . In the postindustrial era , sprawl has entailed no clear-cut disadvantage , such as the loss of protection , nor resulted in a uniquely identifiable cost such as investment in new fortification , however its disadvantages and costs include increased travel time , transport costs , pollution , destruction of countryside , and so on . In Continental Europe , the term peri-urbanisation is often used to denote similar dynamics and phenomena , although the term urban sprawl is currently being used by the European Environment Agency . There is widespread disagreement about what constitutes sprawl and how to quantify it . For example , some commentators measure sprawl only with the average number of residential units per acre in a given area . But others associate it with decentralization ( spread of population without a well-defined centre ) , discontinuity ( leapfrog development , as defined below ) , segregation of uses , and so forth . The term urban sprawl is highly politicized and almost always has negative connotations . It is criticized for causing environmental degradation , intensifying segregation , and undermining the vitality of existing urban areas and is attacked on aesthetic grounds .

[ N 1 ] After 1765 , growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies . Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts , which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor . Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony . Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves , and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown . Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress ( with the exception of Georgia ) to coordinate their resistance , establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power . British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in Concord led to open combat and a British defeat on April 19 , 1775 . Militia forces then besieged Boston , forcing a British evacuation in March 1776 , and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army . Concurrently , the Americans failed decisively in an attempt to invade Quebec and raise insurrection against the British . On July 2 , 1776 , the Second Continental Congress voted for independence , issuing its declaration on July 4 .

The Articles of Confederation came into force on March 1 , 1781 , after being ratified by all 13 states . A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states . The weak central government established by the Articles received only those powers which the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament . The document provided clearly written rules for how the states ' league of friendship would be organized . During the ratification process , the Congress looked to the Articles for guidance as it conducted business , directing the war effort , conducting diplomacy with foreign nations , addressing territorial issues and dealing with Native American relations . Little changed politically once the Articles of Confederation went into effect , as ratification did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing . That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation ; but most Americans continued to call it the Continental Congress , since its organization remained the same . As the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states , delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so . As the government 's weaknesses became apparent , especially after Shays ' Rebellion , some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling nation began asking for changes to the Articles .

  "/wiki/Home_rule_municipality": "Devolution is the statutory delegation of powers from the central government of a sovereign state to govern at a subnational level , such as a regional or local level . It is a form of administrative decentralization . Devolved territories have the power to make legislation relevant to the area and thus granting them a higher level of autonomy . Devolution differs from federalism in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority may be temporary and are reversible , ultimately residing with the central government . Thus , the state remains de jure unitary . Legislation creating devolved parliaments or assemblies can be repealed or amended by central government in the same way as any statute . In federal systems , by contrast , sub-unit government is guaranteed in the constitution , so the powers of the sub-units can not be withdrawn unilaterally by the central government ( i.e . without the consent of the sub-units being granted through the process of constitutional amendment ) . The sub-units therefore have a lower degree of protection under devolution than under federalism .",
