At a distance of about 50 kiloparsecs ( \u2248163,000 light-years ) , the LMC is the second- or third-closest galaxy to the Milky Way , after the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal ( ~16 kpc ) and the possible dwarf irregular galaxy known as the Canis Major Overdensity . Based on readily visible stars and a mass of approximately 10 billion solar masses , the diameter of the LMC is about 14,000 light-years ( 4.3 kpc ) , making it roughly one one-hundredth as massive as the Milky Way . This makes the LMC the fourth-largest galaxy in the Local Group , after the Andromeda Galaxy ( M31 ) , the Milky Way , and the Triangulum Galaxy ( M33 ) . The LMC is classified as a Magellanic spiral . It contains a stellar bar that is geometrically off-center , suggesting that it was a barred dwarf spiral galaxy before its spiral arms were disrupted , likely by tidal interactions from the Small Magellanic Cloud ( SMC ) and the Milky Way 's gravity . With a declination of about \u221270\u00b0 , the LMC is visible as a faint cloud only in the southern celestial hemisphere and from latitudes south of 20\u00b0 N , straddling the border between the constellations of Dorado and Mensa , and appears longer than 20 times the Moon 's diameter ( about 10\u00b0 across ) from dark sites away from light pollution .

  "/wiki/Homo_sapiens": "Homo sapiens is the only extant human species . The name is Latin for 'wise man ' and was introduced in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus ( who is himself the lectotype for the species ) . Extinct species of the genus Homo include Homo erectus , extant from roughly 1.9 to 0.4 million years ago , and a number of other species ( by some authors considered subspecies of either H. sapiens or H. erectus ) . The divergence of the lineage leading to H. sapiens out of ancestral H. erectus ( or an intermediate species such as Homo antecessor ) is estimated to have occurred in Africa roughly 500,000 years ago . The earliest fossil evidence of early Homo sapiens appears in Africa around 300,000 years ago , with the earliest genetic splits among modern people , according to some evidence , dating to around the same time . [ note 1 ] Sustained archaic admixture is known to have taken place both in Africa and ( following the recent Out-Of-Africa expansion ) in Eurasia , between about 100,000 and 30,000 years ago . The term anatomically modern humans ( AMH ) is used to distinguish H. sapiens having an anatomy consistent with the range of phenotypes seen in contemporary humans from varieties of extinct archaic humans . This is useful especially for times and regions where anatomically modern and archaic humans co-existed , for example , in Paleolithic Europe . Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) .",
  "/wiki/Nitrogen": "Nitrogen is the chemical element with the symbol N and atomic number 7 . It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 . Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time , Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first . The name nitrog\u00e8ne was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 , when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates . Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote , from the Greek \u1f00\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 no life , as it is an asphyxiant gas ; this name is instead used in many languages , such as French , Russian , Romanian and Turkish , and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine , azides and azo compounds . Nitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table , often called the pnictogens . The name comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd to choke , directly referencing nitrogen 's asphyxiating properties . It is a common element in the universe , estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System . At standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dinitrogen , a colourless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula N2 . Dinitrogen forms about 78% of Earth 's atmosphere , making it the most abundant uncombined element . Nitrogen occurs in all organisms , primarily in amino acids ( and thus proteins ) , in the nucleic acids ( DNA and RNA ) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate . The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass , the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen , carbon , and hydrogen .",

Members of the dominant species of the planet Krypton are indistinguishable from humans in terms of their appearance ; their physiology and genetics ; however , they are vastly different . In some continuities Kryptonians are difficult to clone because their DNA is so complex that human science is not advanced enough to decipher it . The cellular structure of Kryptonians allows for solar energy to be absorbed at extremely high levels . On the planet Krypton , whose parent star has often been depicted as an ancient red supergiant with a relatively low energy output , their natural abilities were the same as humans . When exposed to a young yellow star like Earth 's Sun , which is much smaller than their own sun and with a vastly higher energy output , their bodies are able to absorb and process so much energy that it eventually manifests as vast superhuman powers ( such as superhuman strength , superhuman speed , invulnerability , flight , x-ray vision , heat vision and superhuman senses ) . Almost all Kryptonians were killed when the planet exploded shortly after the infant Kal-El was sent to Earth . In some continuities , he is the planet 's only survivor .",

  "/wiki/Human": "Humans ( Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina . Together with chimpanzees , gorillas , and orangutans , they are part of the family Hominidae ( the great apes , or hominids ) . Terrestrial animals , humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion ; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals ; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications ; larger , more complex brains than other animals ; and highly advanced and organized societies . Early hominins - particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes - are less often referred to as human than hominins of the genus Homo . Several of these hominins used fire , occupied much of Eurasia , and the lineage that gave rise to Homo sapiens is thought to have diverged in Africa around 500,000 years ago , with the earliest fossil evidence of evidence of early Homo sapiens appearing ( also in Africa ) around 300,000 years ago . The oldest early H. sapiens fossils were found in Jebel Irhoud , Morocco dating to about 315,000 years ago . Discovered in 1967 , Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is , as of 2017 [ update ] , the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) . Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000-70,000 years ago and ( according to recent evidence ) as far back as around 300,000 years ago , in the Middle Stone Age , with some features of behavioral modernity possibly beginning earlier , and possibly in parallel with evolutionary brain globularization in H. sapiens . In several waves of migration , H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world . The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide . Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , which enable advanced abstract reasoning , language , problem solving , sociality , and culture through social learning . Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal : they are the only extant species to build fires , cook food , clothe themselves , and create and use numerous other technologies and arts .",

An offshoot of the Homo sapiens species with an as yet undisclosed origin , Homo mermanus are a mammalian species , but with some fish-like characteristics . Each one possesses two twin gills located on their necks near the clavicle bone , which allow them to breathe underwater . Their skin pigmentation can be either blue ( most Atlanteans ) or green ( most Lemurians and nomads ) Their physiology is also much stronger and more durable than that of the Homo sapiens , necessitated by their exposure to the vast pressure of the deep sea . As a consequence they are physically much stronger than regular humans and can swim up to 30 miles ( 48 km ) per hour . The typical lifespan for a Homo mermanus is 150 years .

The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment . Branchia ( pl . branchiae ) is the zoologists ' name for gills ( from Ancient Greek ) . With the exception of some aquatic insects , the filaments and lamellae ( folds ) contain blood or coelomic fluid , from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls . The blood carries oxygen to other parts of the body . Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water . Gills or gill-like organs , located in different parts of the body , are found in various groups of aquatic animals , including mollusks , crustaceans , insects , fish , and amphibians .

  "/wiki/Olympians_(Marvel_Comics)": "The Olympians are a fictional species appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . These characters are based loosely on the Twelve Olympians/Dii Consentes and other deities of Greek and Roman mythology . During the beginning of the 1960s , the exploits of the Asgardians Thor and his evil brother Loki demonstrated that an updating of ancient myths could again win readers . In 1965 , Stan Lee and Jack Kirby introduced the Olympians in Journey into Mystery Annual # 1 .",
  "/wiki/Twelve_Olympians": "In ancient Greek religion and mythology , the twelve Olympians are the major deities of the Greek pantheon , commonly considered to be Zeus , Hera , Poseidon , Demeter , Athena , Apollo , Artemis , Ares , Hephaestus , Aphrodite , Hermes , and either Hestia or Dionysus . They were called Olympians because , according to tradition , they resided on Mount Olympus . Although Hades was a major ancient Greek god , and was the brother of the first generation of Olympians ( Zeus , Poseidon , Hera , Demeter , and Hestia ) , his realm was the underworld , far from Olympus , and thus was not usually considered to be one of the Olympians . Besides the twelve Olympians , there were many other cultic groupings of twelve gods .",
  "/wiki/Deity": "A deity ( /\u02c8di\u02d0\u026ati/ ( listen ) , /\u02c8de\u026a-/ ( listen ) ) or god is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred . The Oxford Dictionary of English defines deity as a god or goddess ( in a polytheistic religion ) , or anything revered as divine . C. Scott Littleton defines a deity as a being with powers greater than those of ordinary humans , but who interacts with humans , positively or negatively , in ways that carry humans to new levels of consciousness , beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary life . In the English language , a male deity is referred to as a god , while a female deity is referred to as a goddess . Religions can be categorized by how many deities they worship . Monotheistic religions accept only one deity ( predominantly referred to as God ) , polytheistic religions accept multiple deities . Henotheistic religions accept one supreme deity without denying other deities , considering them as aspects of the same divine principle ; and nontheistic religions deny any supreme eternal creator deity but accept a pantheon of deities which live , die and may be reborn like any other being . :35-37:357-58 Although most monotheistic religions traditionally envision their God as omnipotent , omnipresent , omniscient , omnibenevolent , and eternal , none of these qualities are essential to the definition of a deity and various cultures conceptualized their deities differently . Monotheistic religions typically refer to God in masculine terms , :96 while other religions refer to their deities in a variety of ways - masculine , feminine , androgynous and without gender . Historically , many ancient cultures - including the ancient Mesopotamians , Egyptians , Greeks , Romans , and Norsemen- personified natural phenomena , variously as either deliberate causes or effects . Some Avestan and Vedic deities were viewed as ethical concepts . In Indian religions , deities were envisioned as manifesting within the temple of every living being 's body , as sensory organs and mind .",
  "/wiki/Greek_mythology": "Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks and a genre of Ancient Greek folklore . These stories concern the origin and the nature of the world , the lives and activities of deities , heroes , and mythological creatures , and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks ' own cult and ritual practices . Modern scholars study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece and its civilization , and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself . The Greek myths were initially propagated in an oral-poetic tradition most likely by Minoan and Mycenaean singers starting in the 18th century BC ; eventually the myths of the heroes of the Trojan War and its aftermath became part of the oral tradition of Homer 's epic poems , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias . Aside from this narrative deposit in ancient Greek literature , pictorial representations of gods , heroes , and mythic episodes featured prominently in ancient vase paintings and the decoration of votive gifts and many other artifacts . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes .",

  "/wiki/Aztec": "The Aztecs ( /\u02c8\u00e6zt\u025bks/ ) were a Mesoamerican culture that flourished in central Mexico in the post-classic period from 1300 to 1521 . The Aztec peoples included different ethnic groups of central Mexico , particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to the 16th centuries . Aztec culture was organized into city-states ( altepetl ) , some of which joined to form alliances , political confederations , or empires . The Aztec Empire was a confederation of three city-states established in 1427 : Tenochtitlan , city-state of the Mexica or Tenochca ; Texcoco ; and Tlacopan , previously part of the Tepanec empire , whose dominant power was Azcapotzalco . Although the term Aztecs is often narrowly restricted to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan , it is also broadly used to refer to Nahua polities or peoples of central Mexico in the prehispanic era , as well as the Spanish colonial era ( 1521-1821 ) . The definitions of Aztec and Aztecs have long been the topic of scholarly discussion ever since German scientist Alexander von Humboldt established its common usage in the early nineteenth century . Most ethnic groups of central Mexico in the post-classic period shared basic cultural traits of Mesoamerica , and so many of the traits that characterize Aztec culture can not be said to be exclusive to the Aztecs . For the same reason , the notion of Aztec civilization is best understood as a particular horizon of a general Mesoamerican civilization . The culture of central Mexico includes maize cultivation , the social division between nobility ( pipiltin ) and commoners ( macehualtin ) , a pantheon ( featuring Tezcatlipoca , Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl ) , and the calendric system of a xiuhpohualli of 365 days intercalated with a tonalpohualli of 260 days . Particular to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan was the patron God Huitzilopochtli , twin pyramids , and the ceramic ware known as Aztec I to IV . From the 13th century , the Valley of Mexico was the heart of dense population and the rise of city-states . The Mexica were late-comers to the Valley of Mexico , and founded the city-state of Tenochtitlan on unpromising islets in Lake Texcoco , later becoming the dominant power of the Aztec Triple Alliance or Aztec Empire .",

Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen , it was not until 1823 that J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form . Its melting and boiling points of 1414 \u00b0C and 3265 \u00b0C respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals , being only surpassed by boron . Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass , but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth 's crust . It is most widely distributed in dusts , sands , planetoids , and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide ( silica ) or silicates . More than 90% of the Earth 's crust is composed of silicate minerals , making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth 's crust ( about 28% by mass ) after oxygen . Most silicon is used commercially without being separated , and often with little processing of the natural minerals . Such use includes industrial construction with clays , silica sand , and stone .

Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth 's crust , and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen , helium , and oxygen . Carbon 's abundance , its unique diversity of organic compounds , and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life . It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass ( about 18.5% ) after oxygen . The atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways , resulting in various allotropes of carbon .

  "/wiki/Hibernation": "Hibernation is a state of inactivity and metabolic depression in endotherms . Hibernation refers to a season of heterothermy characterized by low body-temperature , slow breathing and heart-rate , and low metabolic rate . It most commonly occurs during winter months . Although traditionally reserved for deep hibernators such as rodents , the term has been redefined to include animals such as bears and is now applied based on active metabolic suppression rather than any absolute decline in body temperature . Many experts believe that the processes of daily torpor and hibernation form a continuum and utilize similar mechanisms . The equivalent during the summer months is aestivation . Hibernation functions to conserve energy when sufficient food is unavailable . To achieve this energy saving , an endothermic animal decreases its metabolic rate and thereby its body temperature . Hibernation may last days , weeks , or months - depending on the species , ambient temperature , time of year , and the individual 's body-condition . Before entering hibernation , animals need to store enough energy to last through the duration of their dormant period , possibly as long as an entire winter . Larger species become hyperphagic , eating a large amount of food and storing the energy in fat deposits . In many small species , food caching replaces eating and becoming fat .",
