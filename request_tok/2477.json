  "/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings": "The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien . The story began as a sequel to Tolkien 's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work . Written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written , with over 150 million copies sold . The title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the Dark Lord Sauron , [ a ] who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth . From quiet beginnings in the Shire , a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside , the story ranges across Middle-earth , following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters , most notably the hobbits Frodo , Sam , Merry and Pippin . Although generally known to readers as a trilogy , the work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , the other to be The Silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher . For economic reasons , The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 . The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers and The Return of the King . Structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end . Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume . The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages . Tolkien 's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins .",
  "/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien": "John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL ( /ru\u02d0l \u02c8t\u0252lki\u02d0n/ ; [ a ] 3 January 1892 - 2 September 1973 ) was an English writer , poet , philologist , and academic , who authored the classic high fantasy works The Hobbit , The Lord of the Rings , and The Silmarillion . He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College , Oxford , from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College , Oxford , from 1945 to 1959 . He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis - they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings . Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972 . After Tolkien 's death , his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father 's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts , including The Silmarillion . These , together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings , form a connected body of tales , poems , fictional histories , invented languages , and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth [ b ] within it . Between 1951 and 1955 , Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings . While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien , the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre . This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the father of modern fantasy literature - or , more precisely , of high fantasy . In 2008 , The Times ranked him sixth on a list of The 50 greatest British writers since 1945 . Forbes ranked him the fifth top-earning dead celebrity in 2009 .",

Its roots are in oral traditions , which then became fantasy literature and drama . From the twentieth century it has expanded further into various media , including film , television , graphic novels , manga and video games . Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the absence of scientific or macabre themes respectively , though these genres overlap .

Most reviews were very favourable , commenting on Rowling 's imagination , humour , simple , direct style and clever plot construction , although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed . The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen , one of Rowling 's favourite authors ; Roald Dahl , whose works dominated children 's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter ; and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer . While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories , others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues , as well as overcoming obstacles like bullies . Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , along with the rest of the Harry Potter series , has been attacked by some religious groups and banned in some countries because of accusations that the novels promote witchcraft under the guise of a heroic , moral story .",

  "/wiki/Farce": "In theatre , a farce is a comedy that aims at entertaining the audience through situations that are highly exaggerated , extravagant , and thus improbable . Farce is also characterized by physical humor , the use of deliberate absurdity or nonsense , and broadly stylized performances . It is also often set in one particular location , where all events occur . Farces have been written for the stage and film . The term farce is derived from the French word for stuffing , in reference to improvisations applied by actors to medieval religious dramas . Later forms of this drama were performed as comical interludes during the 15th and 16th centuries . The oldest surviving farce may be Le Gar\u00e7on et l'aveugle ( The Boy and the Blind Man ) from after 1266 , although the earliest farces that can be dated come from between 1450 and 1550 .

  "/wiki/Romance_novel": "Although the genre is very old , the romance novel or romantic novel discussed in this article is the mass-market version . Novels of this type of genre fiction place their primary focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people , and must have an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending . There are many subgenres of the romance novel , including fantasy , historical romance , paranormal fiction , and science fiction . Romance novels are read primarily by women . The term romance is also applied to a type of novel defined by Walter Scott as a fictitious narrative in prose or verse ; the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents . A thriving genre of works conventionally referred to as romance novels existed in ancient Greece . Other precursors can be found in the literary fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries , including Samuel Richardson 's sentimental novel Pamela , or Virtue Rewarded ( 1740 ) and the novels of Jane Austen . Austen inspired Georgette Heyer , the British author of historical romance set around the time Austen lived , as well as detective fiction . Heyer 's first romance novel , The Black Moth ( 1921 ) , was set in 1751 . The British company Mills and Boon began releasing escapist fiction for women in the 1930s .

Although satire is usually meant to be humorous , its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism , using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society . A feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm - in satire , irony is militant - but parody , burlesque , exaggeration , juxtaposition , comparison , analogy , and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing . This militant irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of ( or at least accept as natural ) the very things the satirist wishes to question .

The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children 's literature . The Hobbit is set within Tolkien 's fictional universe and follows the quest of home-loving Bilbo Baggins , the titular hobbit , to win a share of the treasure guarded by Smaug the dragon . Bilbo 's journey takes him from light-hearted , rural surroundings into more sinister territory . The story is told in the form of an episodic quest , and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien 's geography . Bilbo gains a new level of maturity , competence , and wisdom by accepting the disreputable , romantic , fey , and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense . The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies , where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict . Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story , along with motifs of warfare . These themes have led critics to view Tolkien 's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story . The author 's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in mythology and fairy tales are often noted as influences . The publisher was encouraged by the book 's critical and financial success and , therefore , requested a sequel .",

  "/wiki/Mystery_fiction": "Mystery fiction is a genre of fiction usually involving a mysterious death or a crime to be solved . Often with a closed circle of suspects , each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime . The central character will often be a detective ( like Sherlock Holmes and his assistant John H. Watson ) who eventually solves the mystery by logical deduction from facts presented to the reader . Sometimes mystery books are nonfictional . Mystery fiction can be detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle or suspense element and its logical solution such as a whodunit . Mystery fiction can be contrasted with hardboiled detective stories , which focus on action and gritty realism . Mystery fiction involve a supernatural mystery where the solution does not have to be logical , and even no crime involved . This usage was common in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s , where titles such as Dime Mystery , Thrilling Mystery and Spicy Mystery offered what at the time were described as complicated to solve and weird stories - supernatural horror in the vein of Grand Guignol . This contrasted with parallel titles of the same names which contained conventional hardboiled crime fiction . The first use of mystery in this sense was by Dime Mystery , which started out as an ordinary crime fiction magazine but switched to weird menace during the later part of 1933 .",
