The Ford Model T was named the most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 Car of the Century competition , ahead of the BMC Mini , Citro\u00ebn DS , and Volkswagen Type 1 .

With 16.5 million sold , it stood eighth on the top ten list of most sold cars of all time , as of 2012 [ update ] . Although automobiles had been produced from the 1880s , until the Model T was introduced in 1908 , they were mostly scarce , expensive , and often unreliable . Positioned as reliable , easily maintained , mass-market transportation , it was a runaway success . In a matter of days after the release , 15,000 orders had been placed . The first production Model T was built on August 12 , 1908 and left the factory on September 27 , 1908 , at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit , Michigan .
