He studied under director Kajiro Yamamoto , as did Akira Kurosawa , Ishir\u014d Honda , and Senkichi Taniguchi . When the latter two trainees were drafted into Japan 's war in China , Oda found his career accelerated . He was promoted to director in 1940 with Song of Kunya , after a relatively scant few years of training . Perhaps because of this relative lack of training , and certainly because Oda was not drafted into the army , P.C.L . and Toho kept Oda going as a maker of programmers - trivial pictures that had to be made in order to keep product flowing into the theaters , but which offered little time or room for artistic achievement . Probably his most distinguished credits are Lady From Hell ( 1949 , based on a Kurosawa script ) , Tomei Ningen a 1954 Japanese horror classic inspired by The Invisible Man , a follow-up to his earlier 1954 film Ghost Man . The only film he made ever to be shown outside Japan was the second Godzilla film , Godzilla Raids Again ( 1955 ) , released in the United States as Gigantis , the Fire Monster .

He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema . Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936 , following a brief stint as a painter . After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter , he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata ( a.k.a . Judo Saga ) . After the war , the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel ( 1948 ) , in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role , cemented the director 's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan . The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films . Rashomon , which premiered in Tokyo , became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival . The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry , which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers . Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , including a number of highly regarded ( and often adapted ) films , such as Ikiru ( 1952 ) , Seven Samurai ( 1954 ) and Yojimbo ( 1961 ) .
