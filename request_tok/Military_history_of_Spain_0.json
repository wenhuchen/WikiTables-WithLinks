It was a title in the Norman kingdom of Sicily , applied to palatine officials and members of the curia , usually to those who were Muslims or converts to Islam . The word entered the Latin language as Latin : gaitus or Latin : gaytus . Later the word was used in North Africa for the governor of a fortress or the warden of a prison , also in Spain and Portugal in the form with the definite article alcayde ( Spanish ) alcaide ( Portuguese ) . It is also used as a male Arabic given name .",
  "/wiki/Castellan": "A castellan is the title used in Medieval Europe for an appointed official , a governor of a castle and its surrounding territory referred to as the castellany . The title of governor is retained in the English prison system , as a remnant of the medieval idea of the castellan as head of the local prison . The word stems from the Latin Castellanus , derived from castellum castle . Sometimes also known as a constable of the castle district , the Constable of the Tower of London is , in fact , a form of castellan , with representative powers in the local or national assembly . A castellan was almost always male , but could occasionally be female , as when , in 1194 , Beatrice of Bourbourg [ fr ; nl ] inherited her father 's castellany of Bourbourg upon the death of her brother , Roger . Similarly of Agnes at Harlech Castle upon the death of her husband John de Bonvillars in 1287 .",

The term is a diminutive of city and thus means little city , so called because it is a smaller part of the city of which it is the defensive core . Ancient Sparta had a citadel , as did many other Greek cities and towns . In a fortification with bastions , the citadel is the strongest part of the system , sometimes well inside the outer walls and bastions , but often forming part of the outer wall for the sake of economy . It is positioned to be the last line of defense , should the enemy breach the other components of the fortification system . The functions of the police and the army , as well as the army barracks were developed in the citadel .",

  "/wiki/Castle": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders . Scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . This is distinct from a palace , which is not fortified ; from a fortress , which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility ; and from a fortified settlement , which was a public defence - though there are many similarities among these types of construction . Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses . Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built , they took on a great many forms with many different features , although some , such as curtain walls , arrowslits , and portcullises , were commonplace . European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries , after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes . These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures ; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies . Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies , the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power . Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes , and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community , such as mills , fertile land , or a water source . Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber , but had their defences replaced later by stone . Early castles often exploited natural defences , lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep . In the late 12th and early 13th centuries , a scientific approach to castle defence emerged .",
  "/wiki/Alf\u00e9rez": "In medieval Iberia , an alf\u00e9rez ( Spanish : [ al\u02c8fe\u027ee\u03b8 ] , Galician : [ al\u02c8fe\u027e\u026a\u03b8 ] ) or alferes ( Portuguese : [ \u0250l\u02c8fe\u027e\u0268\u0283 ] , Catalan : [ \u0259l\u02c8fe\u027e\u0259s ] ) was a high-ranking official in the household of a king or magnate . The term is derived from the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633 ( al-f\u0101ris ) , meaning horseman or cavalier , and it was commonly Latinised as alferiz or alferis , although it was also translated into Latin as armiger or armentarius , meaning armour-bearer . The connexion with arms-bearing is visible in several Latin synonyms : fertorarius , inferartis , and offertor . The office was sometimes the same as that of the standard-bearer or signifer . The alf\u00e9rez was generally the next highest-ranking official after the majordomo . He was generally in charge of the king or magnate 's mesnada ( private army ) , his personal retinue of knights , and perhaps also of his armoury and his guard . He generally followed his lord on campaign and into battle . The office of alf\u00e9rez originated in the tenth century . In the Kingdom of Navarre in the tenth and eleventh centuries , the office of alf\u00e9rez changed hands with higher frequency than others , and there is also evidence of rotation . It is the only courtly office for which two officers are cited at the same time : Fort\u00fan Jim\u00e9nez and Ort\u00ed Ortiz were both inferartes in a charter of 1043 . In the kingdoms of Castile and Le\u00f3n in the eleventh and twelfth centuries the office was generally bestowed on young noble members of the court , often as a prelude to promotion to the rank of count . It is known that Alfonso VIII of Castile rewarded his alf\u00e9rez \u00c1lvaro N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara with the grant of a village for carrying his standard in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa .",

  "/wiki/Admiral": "Admiral is one of the highest ranks in some navies , and in many navies is the highest rank .

The French version - amiral without the additional d - tends to add evidence for the Arab origin . In the Commonwealth nations and the United States , a full admiral is equivalent to a full general in the army , and is above vice admiral and below admiral of the fleet , or fleet admiral .

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet . Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome , known as Latium . Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy , and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire . Latin has contributed many words to the English language . In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved . Latin was used as the language of international communication , scholarship and science until well into the 18th century , when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars ( including the Romance languages ) .",

  "/wiki/Great_Armada": "The Spanish Armada ( Spanish : Grande y Felic\u00edsima Armada , lit . 'Great and Most Fortunate Navy ' ) was a Habsburg Spanish fleet of 130 ships that sailed from Corunna in late May 1588 , under the command of the Duke of Medina Sidonia , with the purpose of escorting an army from Flanders to invade England . Medina Sidonia was an aristocrat without naval command experience but was made commander by King Philip II . The aim was to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I and her establishment of Protestantism in England , to stop English interference in the Spanish Netherlands and to stop the harm caused by English and Dutch privateering ships that interfered with Spanish interests in the Americas . English ships sailed from Plymouth to attack the Armada and were faster and more manoeuvrable than the larger Spanish Galleons , enabling them to fire on the Armada without loss as it sailed east off the south coast of England . The Armada could have anchored in The Solent between the Isle of Wight and the English mainland and occupied the Isle of Wight , but Medina Sidonia was under orders from King Philip II to meet up with the Duke of Parma 's forces in the Netherlands so England could be invaded by Parma 's soldiers and other soldiers carried in ships of the Armada . English guns damaged the Armada and a Spanish ship was captured by Sir Francis Drake in the English Channel . The Armada anchored off Calais . While awaiting communications from Duke of Parma , the Armada was scattered by an English fireship night attack and abandoned its rendezvous with Parma 's army , that was blockaded in harbour by Dutch flyboats . In the ensuing Battle of Gravelines , the Spanish fleet was further damaged and was in risk of running aground on the Dutch coast when the wind changed . The Armada , driven by southwest winds , withdrew north , with the English fleet harrying it up the east coast of England . On return to Spain round the north of Scotland and south around Ireland , the Armada was disrupted further by storms .",

  "/wiki/Spanish_warship_Destructor": "Destructor was a 19th-century Spanish warship . She was a fast ocean-going torpedo gunboat and a precursor of the destroyer type of vessel . Destructor was the first warship classified as a destroyer at the time of her commissioning . Her designer was a Spanish Navy officer , Fernando Villaamil , commissioned by the Minister of the Navy , Vice-Admiral Manuel Pezuela .",
  "/wiki/Destroyer": "In naval terminology , a destroyer is a fast , maneuverable , long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet , convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers . They were originally developed in the late 19th century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats , and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 , these torpedo boat destroyers ( TBDs ) were large , swift , and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats . Although the term destroyer had been used interchangeably with TBD and torpedo boat destroyer by navies since 1892 , the term torpedo boat destroyer had been generally shortened to simply destroyer by nearly all navies by the First World War . Before World War II , destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations ; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together . After the war , the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers . This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation . At the start of the 21st century , destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships , with only two nations ( United States and Russia ) operating the heavier class cruisers , with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining . Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era , and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . At 510 feet ( 160 m ) long , a displacement of 9,200 tons , and with armament of more than 90 missiles , guided missile destroyers such as the Arleigh Burke-class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers . Some European navies , such as the French , Spanish , Dutch or German , use the term frigate for their destroyers , which leads to some confusion . After the Second World War , destroyers grew in size . The Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer had a displacement of 2200 tons , while the Arleigh Burke class has a displacement of up to 9600 tons , thus growing in size almost 340% .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_Navy": "The Spanish Navy ( Spanish : Armada Espa\u00f1ola ) is the maritime branch of the Spanish Armed Forces and one of the oldest active naval forces in the world . The Spanish navy was responsible for a number of major historic achievements in navigation , the most famous being the discovery of America by Spain and the first global circumnavigation by Magellan and Elcano . For several centuries , it played a crucial logistical role in the Spanish Empire and defended a vast trade network across the Atlantic Ocean between the Americas and Europe and across the Pacific Ocean between Asia and the Americas . The Spanish Navy was the most powerful maritime force in the world in the 16th and 17th centuries and possibly the world 's largest navy at the end of the 16th century and in the early 17th century [ vague ] . Reform under the Bourbon dynasty improved its logistical and military capacity in the 18th century , for most of which Spain possessed the world 's third largest navy . In the 19th century , the Spanish Navy built and operated one of the first military submarines , made important contributions in the development of destroyer warships , and again achieved a first global circumnavigation , this time by an ironclad vessel .

  "/wiki/Flotilla": "A flotilla ( from Spanish , meaning a small flota ( fleet ) of ships ) , or naval flotilla , is a formation of small warships that may be part of a larger fleet . A flotilla is usually composed of a homogeneous group of the same class of warship , such as frigates , destroyers , torpedo boats , submarines , gunboats , or minesweepers . Groups of larger warships are usually called squadrons , but similar units of non-capital ships may be called squadrons in some instances , and flotillas in others . Formations including more than one capital ship , e.g . men-of-war , battleships , and aircraft carriers , typically alongside smaller ships and support craft , are typically called fleets , each portion led by a capital ship being a squadron or task force ( see reference below ) . A flotilla is usually commanded by a rear admiral , a commodore or a captain , depending on the importance of the command ( a vice admiral would normally command a squadron ) . A flotilla is often divided into two or more divisions , each of which might be commanded by the most senior commander , nearly always a lieutenant at the very least . A flotilla is often , but not necessarily , a permanent formation . In modern navies , flotillas have tended to become administrative units containing several squadrons . As warships have grown larger , the term squadron has gradually replaced the term flotilla for formations of destroyers , frigates and submarines in many navies . A naval flotilla has no direct equivalent on land , but is , perhaps , the rough equivalent in tactical value of a brigade or regiment .",

  "/wiki/Grenade": "A grenade is an explosive weapon typically thrown by hand , but can also refer to projectiles shot out of grenade launchers . Generally , a grenade consists of an explosive charge , a detonating mechanism , and firing pin inside the grenade to trigger the detonating mechanism . Once the soldier throws the grenade , the safety lever releases , the striker throws the safety lever away from the grenade body as it rotates to detonate the primer . The primer explodes and ignites the fuze ( sometimes called the delay element ) . The fuze burns down to the detonator , which explodes the main charge . There are several types of grenades like the fragmentation ( frag ) , high explosive ( HE ) concussion and smoke grenades . Fragmentation grenades are probably the most common in modern armies . They are missiles designed to disperse shrapnel on detonation . The body is generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel , which will provide limited fragmentation through sharding and splintering , though in modern grenades a pre-formed fragmentation matrix inside the grenade is commonly used . The pre-formed fragmentation may be spherical , cuboid , wire or notched wire . Most anti-personnel ( AP ) grenades are designed to detonate either after a time delay or on impact .

  "/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War": "The Spanish Civil War ( Spanish : Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola ) [ note 2 ] was a civil war in Spain fought from 1936 to 1939 . Republicans loyal to the left-leaning Second Spanish Republic , in alliance with anarchists and communists , fought against a revolt by the Nationalists , an alliance of Falangists , monarchists , conservatives and Catholics , led by a military group among whom General Francisco Franco soon achieved a preponderant role . Due to the international political climate at the time , the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle , a war of religion , a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy , between revolution and counterrevolution , and between fascism and communism . It has been frequently called the dress rehearsal for World War II . The Nationalists won the war , which ended in early 1939 , and ruled Spain until Franco 's death in November 1975 . The war began after a pronunciamiento ( a declaration of military opposition ) against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces , originally under the leadership of Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo . The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans , supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties , under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Aza\u00f1a . The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups , including CEDA , monarchists , including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists , and the FE de las JONS , a fascist political party . After the deaths of Sanjurjo , Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis , Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side . The coup was supported by military units in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco , Pamplona , Burgos , Zaragoza , Valladolid , C\u00e1diz , C\u00f3rdoba , and Seville . However , rebelling units in some important cities - such as Madrid , Barcelona , Valencia , Bilbao , and M\u00e1laga - did not gain control , and those cities remained under the control of the government .

  "/wiki/Tercio": "A tercio ( Spanish pronunciation : [ \u02c8te\u027e\u03b8jo ] third ) or tercio espa\u00f1ol ( Spanish third ) was a powerful Spanish infantry division during the time of Habsburg Spain known for its victories on European battlefields in the early modern period . The tercio was an administrative unit with command of up to 3,000 soldiers , subdivided originally into 10 , later 12 compa\u00f1\u00edas , made up of pikemen , swordsmen and arquebusiers or musketeers . These companies were deployed in battle and were further subdivided into units of 30 soldiers . These smaller units could be deployed individually or brought together to form what were sometimes called Spanish squares . These powerful infantry squares were also much used by other European powers , especially the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire . The care that was taken to maintain a high number of old soldiers ( veterans ) in the units , and their professional training , together with the particular personality imprinted on them by the proud hidalgos of the lower nobility that nurtured them , made the tercios for more than two centuries the best infantry in Europe . Moreover , the tercios were the first to efficiently mix pikes and firearms .

  "/wiki/Italian_Wars": "The Italian Wars , often referred to as the Great Wars of Italy and sometimes as the Habsburg-Valois Wars , were a long series of wars fought between 1494 and 1559 in Italy during the Renaissance . The Italian peninsula , economically advanced but politically divided among several states , became the main battleground for European supremacy . The conflicts involved the major powers of Italy and Europe , in a series of events that followed the end of the 40-year long Peace of Lodi agreed in 1454 with the formation of the Italic League . The collapse of the alliance in the 1490s left Italy open to the ambitions of Charles VIII of France , who invaded the Kingdom of Naples in 1494 on the ground of a dynastic claim . The French were however forced to leave Naples after the Republic of Venice formed an alliance with Maximilian I of Austria and Ferdinand V of Spain . In 1499 , Louis XII of France initiated a second campaign against Naples by first taking control of the Duchy of Milan thanks to Cesare Borgia , son of Pope Alexander VI and condottiero for Louis XII , marking an open alliance between the Papacy and France . The second war ended in 1503 , when Ferdinand of Spain ( already ruler of Sicily and Sardinia ) captured the Kingdom of Naples from Louis XII . The new Pope , Julius II ( 1503-1513 ) , reversed the policies of the Borgias and exiled Cesare . With France taking over almost all of Northern Italy after defeating Venice at the Battle of Agnadello , and Ferdinand of Aragon emerging as ruler of the whole south , Julius II planned to free Italy from the barbarians and orchestrated the recapture of the peninsula . After Spain recognized the Two Sicilies as a papal fief , Julius II personally led his armed forces at the Battle of Mirandola , and subsequently forced the French of Louis XII out of Italy in alliance with Switzerland and the Holy Roman Empire . The sudden death of Julius II and the Battle of Marignano led to the restoration of the status quo ante bellum in 1516 : the treaties of Brussels and Noyon , mediated by Maximilian I , Holy Roman Emperor and Pope Leo X , recognized French control in the north ( excluding the Venetian republic ) and Spanish control in the south . War resumed in 1521 as Pope Leo X and Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor ( simultaneously ruler of Austria , the Spanish kingdoms , and the Low Countries ) expelled French forces from Milan ."
