  "/wiki/Cat": "The cat ( Felis catus ) is a small carnivorous mammal . It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family . The cat is either a house cat , a farm cat or a feral cat ; latter ranges freely and avoids human contact . Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt rodents . About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries . The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species , has a strong flexible body , quick reflexes , sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey . Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed . Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing , purring , trilling , hissing , growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language . It is a solitary hunter , but a social species . It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears , such as those made by mice and other small mammals . It is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk . It secretes and perceives pheromones .",
  "/wiki/Fur": "Fur is a thick growth of hair that covers the skin of many animals . It is a defining characteristic of mammals . It consists of a combination of oily guard hair on top and thick underfur beneath . The guard hair keeps moisture and the underfur acts as an insulating blanket that keeps the animal warm . The fur of mammals has many uses : protection , sensory purposes , waterproofing , and camouflaging , with the primary usage being thermoregulation . The types of hair include definitive , which may be shed after reaching a certain length ; vibrissae , which are sensory hairs and are most commonly whiskers ; pelage , which consists of guard hairs , under-fur , and awn hair ; spines , which are a type of stiff guard hair used for defense in , for example , porcupines ; bristles , which are long hairs usually used in visual signals , such as the mane of a lion ; velli , often called down fur , which insulates newborn mammals ; and wool , which is long , soft , and often curly . :99 Hair length is negligible in thermoregulation , as some tropical mammals , such as sloths , have the same fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation ; and , conversely , other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals . The denseness of fur can increase an animal 's insulation value , and arctic mammals especially have dense fur ; for example , the musk ox has guard hairs measuring 30 cm ( 12 in ) as well as a dense underfur , which forms an airtight coat , allowing them to survive in temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C ( \u221240 \u00b0F ) . :162-163 Some desert mammals , such as camels , use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin , allowing the animal to stay cool ; a camel 's fur may reach 70 \u00b0C ( 158 \u00b0F ) in the summer , but the skin stays at 40 \u00b0C ( 104 \u00b0F ) . :188 Aquatic mammals , conversely , trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry . :162-163",
  "/wiki/Chicken": "The chicken ( Gallus gallus domesticus ) is a type of domesticated fowl , a subspecies of the red junglefowl ( Gallus gallus ) . They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals , with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011 . There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl . Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food ( consuming both their meat and eggs ) and , less commonly , as pets . Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies , chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period ( 4th-2nd centuries BC ) . Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia , Southeast Asia , and East Asia , but with the clade found in the Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent . From ancient India , the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor , and to Greece by the 5th century BC . Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC , with the bird that gives birth every day having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar , Babylonia , according to the annals of Thutmose III .",
  "/wiki/Feather": "Feathers are epidermal growths that form the distinctive outer covering , or plumage , on dinosaurs , both avian and some non-avian , and possibly other archosauromorphs . They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates and a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty . They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups . Although feathers cover most of the bird 's bodies , they arise only from certain well-defined tracts on the skin . They aid in flight , thermal insulation , and waterproofing . In addition , coloration helps in communication and protection . Plumology ( or plumage science ) is the name for the science that is associated with the study of feathers .",
  "/wiki/Dog": "The domestic dog ( Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species ) is a member of the genus Canis ( canines ) , which forms part of the wolf-like canids , and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore . The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated , which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct . The dog was the first species to be domesticated , and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes . Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids . Dogs vary widely in shape , size and colors . They perform many roles for humans , such as hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police and military , companionship and , more recently , aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles . This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of man 's best friend .",
  "/wiki/Canid": "Canidae /\u02c8k\u00e6n\u026adi\u02d0/ ( from Latin , canis , dog ) is a biological family of dog-like carnivorans . A member of this family is called a canid . There are three subfamilies found within the canid family , which are the extinct Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae , and the extant Caninae . The Caninae are known as canines , which includes domestic dogs , wolves , foxes and other extant and extinct species . Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica , having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time . Canids vary in size from the 2-metre-long ( 6.6 ft ) gray wolf to the 24-centimetre-long ( 9.4 in ) fennec fox . The body forms of canids are similar , typically having long muzzles , upright ears , teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh , long legs , and bushy tails . They are mostly social animals , living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively . Typically , only the dominant pair in a group breeds , and a litter of young are reared annually in an underground den . Canids communicate by scent signals and vocalizations . One canid , the domestic dog , long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals .",
  "/wiki/Melatonin": "Melatonin is a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle . It is primarily released by the pineal gland . As a supplement , it is often used for the short-term treatment of trouble sleeping such as from jet lag or shift work . Evidence of benefit , however , is unclear . One review found onset of sleep occurred 6 minutes faster with use but found no change in total time asleep . It may work as well as the medication ramelteon . It is typically taken by mouth . Side effects from supplements are minimal at low doses for short durations . Side effects may include sleepiness , headaches , nausea , diarrhea , and abnormal dreams . Use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding . Use is also not recommended in those with liver problems . In animals ( including humans ) , melatonin is involved in synchronizing the circadian rhythm including sleep-wake timing , blood pressure regulation , and seasonal reproduction .",
  "/wiki/Pineal": "The pineal gland , conarium , or epiphysis cerebri , is a small endocrine gland in the brain of most vertebrates . The pineal gland produces melatonin , a serotonin-derived hormone which modulates sleep patterns in both circadian and seasonal cycles . The shape of the gland resembles a pine cone from which it derived its name . The pineal gland is located in the epithalamus , near the center of the brain , between the two hemispheres , tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join . The pineal gland is one of the neuroendocrine secretory circumventricular organs in which there does not exist the blood-brain barrier at the capillary level . Nearly all vertebrate species possess a pineal gland . The most important exception is a primitive vertebrate , the hagfish . Even in the hagfish , however , there may be a pineal equivalent structure in the dorsal diencephalon . The lancelet Branchiostoma lanceolatum , the nearest existing relative to vertebrates , also lacks a recognizable pineal gland . The lamprey ( another primitive vertebrate ) , however , does possess one . A few more developed vertebrates have lost pineal glands over the course of their evolution . The results of various scientific research in evolutionary biology , comparative neuroanatomy and neurophysiology have explained the evolutionary history ( phylogeny ) of the pineal gland in different vertebrate species .",
  "/wiki/Snake": "Snakes are elongated , legless , carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes . Like all other squamates , snakes are ectothermic , amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales . Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors , enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws . To accommodate their narrow bodies , snakes ' paired organs ( such as kidneys ) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side , and most have only one functional lung . Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca . Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution , leading to many lineages of legless lizards . Legless lizards resemble snakes , but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears , which snakes lack , although this rule is not universal ( see Amphisbaenia , Dibamidae , and Pygopodidae ) . Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica , and on most smaller land masses ; exceptions include some large islands , such as Ireland , Iceland , Greenland , the Hawaiian archipelago , and the islands of New Zealand , and many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans . Additionally , sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans . More than 20 families are currently recognized , comprising about 520 genera and about 3,600 species . They range in size from the tiny , 10.4 cm ( 4.1 in ) -long Barbados thread snake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters ( 22.8 ft ) in length . The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters ( 42 ft ) long .",
  "/wiki/Snakeskin": "Snakeskin may either refer to the skin of a live snake , the shed skin of a snake after molting , or to a type of leather that is made from the hide of a dead snake .",
  "/wiki/Lizard": "Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles , with over 6,000 species , ranging across all continents except Antarctica , as well as most oceanic island chains . The group is paraphyletic as it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia ; some lizards are more closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to other lizards . Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3 meter long Komodo dragon . Most lizards are quadrupedal , running with a strong side-to-side motion . Others are legless , and have long snake-like bodies . Some such as the forest-dwelling Draco lizards are able to glide . They are often territorial , the males fighting off other males and signalling , often with brightly colours , to attract mates and to intimidate rivals . Lizards are mainly carnivorous , often being sit-and-wait predators ; many smaller species eat insects , while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo . Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations , including venom , camouflage , reflex bleeding , and the ability to sacrifice and regrow their tails .",
  "/wiki/Skin": "Skin is the soft outer tissue covering of vertebrates with three main functions : protection , regulation , and sensation . Other animal coverings , such as the arthropod exoskeleton , have different developmental origin , structure and chemical composition . The adjective cutaneous means of the skin ( from Latin cutis , skin ) . In mammals , the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue , and guards the underlying muscles , bones , ligaments and internal organs . Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians , reptiles , and birds . All mammals have some hair on their skin , even marine mammals like whales , dolphins , and porpoises which appear to be hairless . The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors . For example , the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss . Its other functions are insulation , temperature regulation , sensation , and the production of vitamin D folates . Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue . This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented . The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism .",
  "/wiki/Hermit_crab": "Hermit crabs are decapod crustaceans of the superfamily Paguroidea . Most of the approximately 1,110 species possess an asymmetric abdomen concealed in a scavenged mollusc shell .",
  "/wiki/Exoskeleton": "An exoskeleton ( from Greek \u03ad\u03be\u03c9 , \u00e9x\u014d outer and \u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 , skelet\u00f3s skeleton ) is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal 's body , in contrast to the internal skeleton ( endoskeleton ) of , for example , a human . In usage , some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as shells . Examples of animals with exoskeletons include insects such as grasshoppers and cockroaches , and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters , as well as the shells of certain sponges and the various groups of shelled molluscs , including those of snails , clams , tusk shells , chitons and nautilus . Some animals , such as the tortoise , have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton .",
  "/wiki/Amphibian": "Amphibians are ectothermic , tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia . Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia . They inhabit a wide variety of habitats , with most species living within terrestrial , fossorial , arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems . Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water , but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this . The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs . Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin . They are superficially similar to lizards but , along with mammals and birds , reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed . With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins , amphibians are often ecological indicators ; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe . The earliest amphibians evolved in the Devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins , features that were helpful in adapting to dry land . They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods , but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates . Over time , amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity , leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia . The three modern orders of amphibians are Anura ( the frogs and toads ) , Urodela ( the salamanders ) , and Apoda ( the caecilians ) .",
  "/wiki/Arachnid": "Arachnida ( /\u0259\u02c8r\u00e6kn\u026ad\u0259/ ) is a class of joint-legged invertebrate animals ( arthropods ) , in the subphylum Chelicerata . Spiders are the largest order in the class , which also includes scorpions , ticks , mites , harvestmen , and solifuges . In 2019 , a molecular phylogenetic study also placed horseshoe crabs in Arachnida . Almost all adult arachnids have eight legs , although the front pair of legs in some species has converted to a sensory function , while in other species , different appendages can grow large enough to take on the appearance of extra pairs of legs . The term is derived from the Greek word \u1f00\u03c1\u03ac\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 ( ar\u00e1chn\u0113 ) , from the myth of the hubristic human weaver Arachne who was turned into a spider . Almost all extant arachnids are terrestrial , living mainly on land . However , some inhabit freshwater environments and , with the exception of the pelagic zone , marine environments as well . They comprise over 100,000 named species .",
  "/wiki/Insect": "Insects or Insecta ( from Latin insectum ) are hexapod invertebrates and the largest group within the arthropod phylum . Definitions and circumscriptions vary ; usually , insects comprise a class within the Arthropoda . As used here , the term Insecta is synonymous with Ectognatha . Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton , a three-part body ( head , thorax and abdomen ) , three pairs of jointed legs , compound eyes and one pair of antennae . Insects are the most diverse group of animals ; they include more than a million described species and represent more than half of all known living organisms . The total number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million ; potentially over 90% of the animal life forms on Earth are insects . Insects may be found in nearly all environments , although only a small number of species reside in the oceans , which are dominated by another arthropod group , crustaceans . Nearly all insects hatch from eggs . Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts . The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure , habit and habitat , and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo four-stage metamorphosis . Insects that undergo three-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages . The higher level relationship of the insects is unclear .",
  "/wiki/Mayfly": "Mayflies ( also known as Canadian soldiers in the United States , and as shadflies or fishflies in Canada and the upper Midwestern U.S. ; also up-winged flies in the United Kingdom ) are aquatic insects belonging to the order Ephemeroptera . This order is part of an ancient group of insects termed the Palaeoptera , which also contains dragonflies and damselflies . Over 3,000 species of mayfly are known worldwide , grouped into over 400 genera in 42 families . Mayflies exhibit a number of ancestral traits that were probably present in the first flying insects , such as long tails and wings that do not fold flat over the abdomen . Their immature stages are aquatic fresh water forms ( called naiads or nymphs ) , whose presence indicates a clean , unpolluted environment . They are unique among insect orders in having a fully winged terrestrial preadult stage , the subimago , which moults into a sexually mature adult , the imago . Mayflies hatch ( emerge as adults ) from spring to autumn , not necessarily in May , in enormous numbers . Some hatches attract tourists . Fly fishermen make use of mayfly hatches by choosing artificial fishing flies that resemble the species in question . One of the most famous English mayflies is Rhithrogena germanica , the fisherman 's March brown mayfly . The brief lives of mayfly adults have been noted by naturalists and encyclopaedists since Aristotle and Pliny the Elder in classical times . The German engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer included a mayfly in his 1495 engraving The Holy Family with the Mayfly to suggest a link between heaven and earth ."
