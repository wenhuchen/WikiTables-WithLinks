Originally developed as an IBM PC XT emulator , it later emulates other IBM PC compatible computers as well . A fork known as 86Box is also available , which includes a number of added features , such as support for SCSI and additional boards .",
  "/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible": "IBM PC compatible computers are similar to the original IBM PC , XT , and AT that are able to use the same software and expansion cards . Such computers were referred to as PC clones , or IBM clones . The term IBM PC compatible is now a historical description only , since IBM no longer sells personal computers . The industry jargon PC sometimes does n't mean personal computer generally , but rather a computer running Microsoft Windows , in contrast to Apple 's Mac . These clones duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the IBM PC architecture . This was facilitated by IBM 's choice of commodity hardware components and by various manufacturers ' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a clean room design technique . Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS . [ citation needed ] Early IBM PC compatibles used the same computer bus as the original PC and AT models . The IBM AT compatible bus was later named the Industry Standard Architecture ( ISA ) bus by manufacturers of compatible computers . Descendants of the IBM PC compatibles comprise the majority of personal computers on the market presently , with the dominant operating system being Microsoft Windows , although interoperability with the bus structure and peripherals of the original PC architecture may be limited or non-existent . Some of these computers ran MS-DOS but had enough hardware differences that IBM compatible software could not be used ; examples include slight differences in the memory map , serial ports or video hardware . Only the Macintosh kept significant market share without having compatibility with the IBM PC .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms .

  "/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT": "The IBM Personal Computer XT , often shortened to the IBM XT , PC XT , or simply XT , is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive . It was released as IBM Machine Type number 5160 on March 8 , 1983 . Apart from the hard drive , it was essentially the same as the original PC , with only minor improvements . The XT was mainly intended as an enhanced IBM PC for business users . Later floppy-only models would effectively replace the original model 5150 PC . A corresponding 3270 PC featuring 3270 terminal emulation was released later in October 1983 . XT stands for eXtended Technology .",

  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing , cross-platform software ( also multi-platform software or platform-independent software ) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms . Cross-platform software may be divided into two types ; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports , and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation , e.g. , software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms . For example , a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS . Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms , or on as few as two platforms . Cross-platform frameworks ( such as Qt , Flutter , NativeScript , Xamarin , Phonegap , Ionic , and React Native ) exist to aid cross-platform development .",
  "/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer": "The IBM Personal Computer , commonly known as the IBM PC , is the original version of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform . It is IBM model number 5150 and was introduced on August 12 , 1981 . It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Philip Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton , Florida . The generic term personal computer ( PC ) was in use years before 1981 , applied as early as 1972 to the Xerox PARC 's Alto , but the term PC came to mean more specifically a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM 's Personal Computer branded products . The machine was based on open architecture , and third-party suppliers sprang up to provide peripheral devices , expansion cards , and software . IBM had a substantial influence on the personal computer market in standardizing a platform for personal computers , and IBM compatible became an important criterion for sales growth . Only the Apple Macintosh family kept a significant share of the microcomputer market after the 1980s without compatibility to the IBM personal computer .",
  "/wiki/Intel_8086": "The 8086 ( also called iAPX 86 ) is a 16-bit microprocessor chip designed by Intel between early 1976 and June 8 , 1978 , when it was released . The Intel 8088 , released July 1 , 1979 , is a slightly modified chip with an external 8-bit data bus ( allowing the use of cheaper and fewer supporting ICs ) , [ note 1 ] and is notable as the processor used in the original IBM PC design . The 8086 gave rise to the x86 architecture , which eventually became Intel 's most successful line of processors . On June 5 , 2018 , Intel released a limited-edition CPU celebrating the anniversary of the Intel 8086 , called the Intel Core i7-8086K .",
  "/wiki/Intel_80188": "The Intel 80188 microprocessor was a variant of the Intel 80186 . The 80188 had an 8-bit external data bus instead of the 16-bit bus of the 80186 ; this made it less expensive to connect to peripherals . The 16-bit registers and the one megabyte address range were unchanged , however . It had a throughput of 1 million instructions per second .",
  "/wiki/Freeware": "Freeware is software , most often proprietary , that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user . There is no agreed-upon set of rights , license , or EULA that defines freeware unambiguously ; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers . For instance , modification , redistribution by third parties , and reverse engineering without the author 's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others . Unlike with free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge , the source code for freeware is typically not made available . Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by , for example , encouraging sales of a more capable version , as in the freemium and shareware business models .",

  "/wiki/Linux": "Linux ( /\u02c8l\u026an\u0259ks/ ( listen ) LIN-\u0259ks ) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds . Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",

JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs . Originally used only in web browsers , JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications . Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java , including language name , syntax , and respective standard libraries , the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design .",
  "/wiki/Google_Native_Client": "Google Native Client ( NaCl ) is a sandboxing technology for running either a subset of Intel x86 , ARM , or MIPS native code , or a portable executable , in a sandbox . It allows safely running native code from a web browser , independent of the user operating system , allowing web apps to run at near-native speeds , which aligns with Google 's plans for Chrome OS . It may also be used for securing browser plugins , and parts of other applications or full applications such as ZeroVM . To demonstrate the readiness of the technology , on 9 December 2011 , Google announced the availability of several new Chrome-only versions of games known for their rich and processor-intensive graphics , including Bastion ( no longer supported on the Chrome Web Store ) . NaCl runs hardware-accelerated 3D graphics ( via OpenGL ES 2.0 ) , sandboxed local file storage , dynamic loading , full screen mode , and mouse capture . There are also plans to make NaCl available on handheld devices . Portable Native Client ( PNaCl ) is an architecture-independent version . PNaCl apps are compiled ahead-of-time . PNaCl is recommended over NaCl for most use cases . The general concept of NaCl ( running native code in web browser ) has been implemented before in ActiveX , which , while still in use , has full access to the system ( disk , memory , user-interface , registry , etc. ) . Native Client avoids this issue by using sandboxing . An alternative of sorts to NaCl is asm.js , which also allows applications written in C or C++ to be compiled to run in the browser ( at more than half the native speed ) , and also supports ahead-of-time compilation , but is a subset of JavaScript and hence backwards-compatible with browsers that do not support it directly ."
