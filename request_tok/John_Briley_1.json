  "/wiki/Jewish_American": "American Jews , or Jewish Americans , are Americans who are Jews , whether by religion , ethnicity , culture , or nationality . Today the Jewish community in the United States consists primarily of Ashkenazi Jews , who descend from diaspora Jewish populations of Central and Eastern Europe and comprise about 90-95% of the American Jewish population . Most American Ashkenazim are US-born , with a dwindling number of now-elderly earlier immigrants , as well as some more recent foreign-born immigrants . During the colonial era , prior to the mass immigration of Ashkenazim , Spanish and Portuguese Jews represented the bulk of America 's then-small Jewish population , and while their descendants are a minority today , they , along with an array of other Jewish communities , represented the remainder of American Jews , including other more recent Sephardic Jews , Mizrahi Jews , various other ethnically Jewish communities , as well as a smaller number of converts to Judaism . The American Jewish community manifests a wide range of Jewish cultural traditions , encompassing the full spectrum of Jewish religious observance . Depending on religious definitions and varying population data , the United States has the largest or second largest Jewish community in the world , after Israel . In 2012 , the American Jewish population was estimated at between 5.5 million and eight million , depending on the definition of the term , which constitutes between 1.7% and 2.6% of the total U.S. population .",

  "/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust": "A nuclear holocaust , nuclear apocalypse or atomic holocaust is a theoretical scenario involving widespread destruction and radioactive fallout causing the collapse of civilization , through the use of nuclear weapons . Under such a scenario , some or all of the Earth is made uninhabitable by nuclear warfare in future world wars . Besides the immediate destruction of cities by nuclear blasts , the potential aftermath of a nuclear war could involve firestorms , a nuclear winter , widespread radiation sickness from fallout , and/or the temporary loss of much modern technology due to electromagnetic pulses . Some scientists , such as Alan Robock , have speculated that a thermonuclear war could result in the end of modern civilization on Earth , in part due to a long-lasting nuclear winter . In one model , the average temperature of Earth following a full thermonuclear war falls for several years by 7 to 8 degrees Celsius ( 13 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit ) on average . Nonetheless , early Cold War-era studies suggested that billions of humans would survive the immediate effects of nuclear blasts and radiation following a global thermonuclear war . Some scholars [ who ? ] argue that nuclear war could indirectly contribute to human extinction via secondary effects , including environmental consequences , societal breakdown , and economic collapse . Additionally , it has been argued that even a relatively small-scale nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan involving 100 Hiroshima yield ( 15 kilotons ) weapons , could cause a nuclear winter and kill more than a billion people . Since 1947 , the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has visualized how close the world is to a nuclear war . The threat of a nuclear holocaust plays an important role in the popular perception of nuclear weapons . It features in the security concept of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) [ citation needed ] and is a common scenario in survivalism .",

It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam . North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet Union , China , and other communist allies ; South Vietnam was supported by the United States , South Korea , the Philippines , Australia , Thailand and other anti-communist allies . The war , considered a Cold War-era proxy war by some , lasted 19 years , with direct U.S. involvement ending in 1973 , and included the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War , which ended with all three countries becoming communist in 1975 .

It had both guerrilla and regular army units , as well as a network of cadres who organized peasants in the territory it controlled . Many soldiers were recruited in South Vietnam , but others were attached to the People 's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) , the regular North Vietnamese army . During the war , communists and anti-war activists insisted the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng was an insurgency indigenous to the South , while the U.S. and South Vietnamese governments portrayed the group as a tool of Hanoi . Although the terminology distinguishes northerners from the southerners , communist forces were under a single command structure set up in 1958 . North Vietnam established the National Liberation Front on December 20 , 1960 , to foment insurgency in the South . Many of the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng 's core members were volunteer regroupees , southern Vi\u1ec7t Minh who had resettled in the North after the Geneva Accord ( 1954 ) . Hanoi gave the regroupees military training and sent them back to the South along the Ho Chi Minh trail in the early 1960s . The NLF called for southern Vietnamese to overthrow the camouflaged colonial regime of the American imperialists and to make efforts toward the peaceful unification . The PLAF 's best-known action was the Tet Offensive , a gigantic assault on more than 100 South Vietnamese urban centers in 1968 , including an attack on the U.S. embassy in Saigon . The offensive riveted the attention of the world 's media for weeks , but also overextended the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng . Later communist offensives were conducted predominantly by the North Vietnamese .",

  "/wiki/Revue": "A revue ( from French 'magazine ' or 'overview ' ) is a type of multi-act popular theatrical entertainment that combines music , dance , and sketches . The revue has its roots in 19th century popular entertainment and melodrama but grew into a substantial cultural presence of its own during its golden years from 1916 to 1932 . Though most famous for their visual spectacle , revues frequently satirized contemporary figures , news or literature . Similar to the related subforms of operetta and musical theatre , the revue art form brings together music , dance and sketches to create a compelling show . In contrast to these , however , revue does not have an overarching storyline . Rather , a general theme serves as the motto for a loosely-related series of acts that alternate between solo performances and dance ensembles . Due to high ticket prices , ribald publicity campaigns and the occasional use of prurient material , the revue was typically patronized by audience members who earned more and felt even less restricted by middle-class social mores than their contemporaries in vaudeville . Like much of that era 's popular entertainments , revues often featured material based on sophisticated , irreverent dissections of topical matter , public personae and fads , though the primary attraction was found in the frank display of the female body .",
