  "/wiki/Ontario_Highway_404": "King 's Highway 404 ( pronounced four-oh-four ) , also known as Highway 404 and colloquially as the 404 , is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario connecting Highway 401 and the Don Valley Parkway ( DVP ) in Toronto with East Gwillimbury . The 50.1-kilometre ( 31.1 mi ) controlled-access highway also connects with Highway 407 in Markham . Highway 404 provides access to the eastern edge of Richmond Hill , Aurora and Newmarket and the western edge of Whitchurch-Stouffville , in addition to the southern edge of Keswick . Construction on the freeway began soon after the completion of the Don Valley Parkway , with the first section south of Steeles Avenue opening in 1977 . Over the next twelve years , the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) undertook a continuous construction program to build the freeway to Davis Drive in Newmarket . This was completed on 24 October 1989 . The route has undergone a periodic series of smaller extensions and widening in the years since , now travelling a further 15.5 km ( 9.6 mi ) north to Woodbine Avenue near Ravenshoe Road in the town of East Gwillimbury . Future proposals may one day result in an extension to southeast of Beaverton . Highway 404 is one of several freeways in the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) with High-Occupancy Vehicle ( HOV ) lanes ; the southbound lane was one of the initial projects in the province and opened on 13 December 2005 .

Highway 48 was first designated in 1937 to connect Port Bolster with Highway 12 in Beaverton . It was extended south to meet with Highway 401 in the 1950s in anticipation of a planned freeway connection around the eastern shore of Lake Simcoe that ultimately became Highway 404 . In the mid-1970s , Highway 48 assumed a portion of the route of Highway 46 in Victoria Country , now the city of Kawartha Lakes , extending the route to Highway 35 in Coboconk . Between then and 1998 , the route was 128 km ( 80 mi ) .

During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) . The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada .
