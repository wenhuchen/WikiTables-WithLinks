  "/wiki/Vichy_France": "Vichy France ( French : R\u00e9gime de Vichy ) is the common name of the French State ( \u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais ) headed by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain during World War II . Evacuated from Paris to Vichy in the unoccupied Free Zone ( zone libre ) in the southern part of metropolitan France which included French Algeria , it remained responsible for the civil administration of France as well as the French colonial empire . From 1940 to 1942 , while the Vichy regime was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine , the Germans and Italians militarily occupied northern and south-eastern France . While Paris remained the de jure capital of France , the government chose to relocate to the town of Vichy , 360 km ( 220 mi ) to the south in the zone libre , which thus became the de facto capital of the French State . Following the Allied landings in French North Africa in November 1942 , southern France was also militarily occupied by Germany and Italy to protect the Mediterranean coastline . Petain 's government remained in Vichy as the nominal government of France , albeit one that collaborated with Nazi Germany from November 1942 onwards . The government at Vichy remained there until late 1944 , when it lost its de facto authority due to the Allied invasion of France and the government was compelled to relocate to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany , where it continued to exist on paper until the end of hostilities in Europe . After being appointed Premier by President Albert Lebrun , Marshal P\u00e9tain 's cabinet agreed to end the war and signed an Armistice with Germany on 22 June 1940 . On 10 July , the Third Republic was effectively dissolved as P\u00e9tain was granted full powers by the National Assembly . At Vichy , P\u00e9tain established an authoritarian government that reversed many liberal policies and began tight supervision of the economy , calling for National Regeneration , with central planning a key feature . Labour unions came under tight government control . Conservative Catholics became prominent and clerical input in schools resumed .",

Qualified in submarines during his early years , he later oversaw the conversion of these vessels ' propulsion from gasoline to diesel , and then later was key in acquiring approval to build the world 's first nuclear-powered submarine , USS Nautilus , whose propulsion system later completely superseded diesel-powered submarines in the US . He also , beginning in 1917 , was the Navy 's leading developer of underway replenishment techniques , the tool which during the Pacific war would allow the US fleet to operate away from port almost indefinitely .

USS Arleigh Burke ( DDG-51 ) , the lead ship of its class of Aegis-equipped guided missile destroyers , was commissioned in Burke 's honor in 1991 , during his lifetime .",
  "/wiki/Arleigh_Burke-class_destroyer": "The Arleigh Burke class of guided missile destroyers ( DDGs ) is a United States Navy class of destroyer built around the Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multifunction passive electronically scanned array radar . The class is named for Admiral Arleigh Burke , an American destroyer officer in World War II , and later Chief of Naval Operations . The class leader , USS Arleigh Burke , was commissioned during Admiral Burke 's lifetime . These warships were designed as multimission destroyers , able to fulfill the strategic land strike role with Tomahawk missiles ; antiaircraft warfare ( AAW ) role with powerful Aegis radar and surface-to-air missiles ; antisubmarine warfare ( ASW ) with towed sonar array , anti-submarine rockets , and ASW helicopter ; and antisurface warfare ( ASuW ) with Harpoon missile launcher . With upgrades to their AN/SPY-1 phased radar systems and their associated missile payloads as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System , the ships of this class have also begun to demonstrate some promise as mobile antiballistic missile and anti-satellite weaponry platforms . Some versions of the class no longer have the towed sonar , or Harpoon missile launcher . Their hull and superstructure were designed to have a reduced radar cross-section . The first ship of the class was commissioned on 4 July 1991 . With the decommissioning of the last Spruance-class destroyer , USS Cushing , on 21 September 2005 , the Arleigh Burke-class ships became the U.S. Navy 's only active destroyers , until the Zumwalt class became active in 2016 . The Arleigh Burke class has the longest production run for any post-World War II U.S. Navy surface combatant . Besides the 62 vessels of this class ( comprising 21 of Flight I , 7 of Flight II and 34 of Flight IIA ) in service by 2016 , up to a further 42 ( of Flight III ) have been envisioned . With an overall length of 505 to 509 feet ( 154 to 155 m ) , displacement ranging from 8,315 to 9,200 tons , and weaponry including over 90 missiles , the Arleigh Burke class are larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers .",
  "/wiki/Elmo_R._Zumwalt,_Jr.": "Elmo Russell Bud Zumwalt Jr. ( November 29 , 1920 - January 2 , 2000 ) was a United States Navy officer and the youngest person to serve as Chief of Naval Operations . As an admiral and later the 19th Chief of Naval Operations , Zumwalt played a major role in United States military history , especially during the Vietnam War . A decorated war veteran , Zumwalt reformed United States Navy personnel policies in an effort to improve enlisted life and ease racial tensions . After he retired from a 32-year navy career , he launched an unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate .",
  "/wiki/Zumwalt-class_destroyer": "The Zumwalt-class destroyer is a class of three United States Navy guided missile destroyers designed as multi-mission stealth ships with a focus on land attack . It is a multi-role class that was designed for secondary roles of surface warfare and anti-aircraft warfare and originally designed with a primary role of naval gunfire support . It was intended to take the place of battleships in meeting a congressional mandate for naval fire support . The ship is designed around its two Advanced Gun Systems , their turrets and magazines , and unique Long Range Land Attack Projectile ( LRLAP ) ammunition . LRLAP procurement was cancelled , rendering the guns unusable , so the Navy re-purposed the ships for surface warfare . Procurement was halted after the first three Zumwalts , and the navy reverted to building Arleigh Burke destroyers . A National Review article by Mike Fredenburg calls the Zumwalts an unmitigated disaster . The class design emerged from the DD-21 land attack destroyer program as DD ( X ) . These ships are classed as destroyers , but they are much larger than any other active destroyer or cruiser . The vessels ' distinctive appearance results from the design requirement for a low radar cross-section ( RCS ) . The Zumwalt-class has a wave-piercing tumblehome hull form whose sides slope inward above the waterline , which dramatically reduces RCS by returning much less energy than a conventional flare hull form . The appearance has been compared to that of the historic USS Monitor and her famous antagonist CSS Virginia .",
