Once the primary east-west route across the southern portion of Ontario , most of Highway 2 in Ontario was bypassed by Ontario Highway 401 , completed in 1968 . The August 1997 completion of Highway 403 bypassed one final section through Brantford . Virtually all of the 837.4 km ( 520.3 mi ) length of Highway 2 was deemed a local route and removed from the provincial highway system on January 1 , 1998 , with the exception of a 1-kilometre ( 0.62 mi ) section east of Gananoque .

It stretches 828 kilometres ( 514 mi ) from Windsor in the west to the Ontario-Quebec border in the east . The part of Highway 401 that passes through Toronto is North America 's busiest highway , and one of the widest . Together with Quebec Autoroute 20 , it forms the road transportation backbone of the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor , along which over half of Canada 's population resides and is also a Core Route in the National Highway System of Canada . The route is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) and patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police . The speed limit is 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) throughout its length , with the only exceptions the posted 80 km/h ( 50 mph ) limit westbound in Windsor and in most construction zones . By the end of 1952 , three individual highways were numbered Highway 401 : the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway 11 ( Yonge Street ) ; Highway 2A between West Hill and Newcastle ; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville , now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway . These three sections of highway were 11.8 , 54.7 and 41.2 km , ( 7.3 , 34.0 and 25.6 mi ) , respectively . In 1964 , the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario-Quebec border . In 1965 it was given a second designation , the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway , in honour of two Fathers of Confederation . At the end of 1968 , the Gananoque-Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade-separated near Kingston , making Highway 401 a freeway for its entire 817.9-km length . On August 24 , 2007 , the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway / Highway 404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes , as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner 's office in Toronto .",

Until the late 1990s , Highway 3 formed a single continuous 413.2 km ( 256.8 mi ) route from the Ambassador Bridge to near the Peace Bridge , but since then has had significant portion transferred to regional and county governments . A large segment of the route follows the historic Talbot Trail , a settlement road following the northern shore of Lake Erie constructed by Colonel Talbot in the early 1800s as part of a grand settlement plan along the lake front . East of Canborough , the road generally follows older settlement trails : Forks Road , connecting Dunnville with Wainfleet , portions of Sherk 's Road , through Port Colborne to Gasline , and the Garrison Road , a military road built west from Fort Erie .

A 2004 Border Transportation Partnership study showed that 150,000 jobs in the region and US $ 13 billion in annual production depend on the Detroit-Windsor international border crossing . The bridge is owned by Grosse Pointe billionaire Manuel Moroun through the Detroit International Bridge Company in the United States and the Canadian Transit Company in Canada . In 1979 , when the previous owners put it on the New York Stock Exchange and shares were traded , Moroun was able to buy shares , eventually acquiring the bridge .

The physical highway , however , continues as the Gardiner Expressway into downtown Toronto . The QEW is one of Ontario 's busiest highways , with an average of close to 200,000 vehicles per day on some sections . Major highway junctions are at Highway 420 in Niagara Falls , Highway 405 in Niagara-on-the-Lake , Highway 406 in St. Catharines , the Red Hill Valley Parkway in Hamilton , Highway 403 and Highway 407 in Burlington , Highway 403 at the Oakville-Mississauga boundary , and Highway 427 in Etobicoke . Within the Regional Municipality of Halton , between its two junctions with Highway 403 , the QEW is signed concurrently with Highway 403 . The history of the QEW dates back to 1931 , when work began to widen the Middle Road in a similar fashion to the nearby Dundas Highway and Lakeshore Road as a relief project during the Great Depression . Following the 1934 provincial election , Ontario Minister of Highways Thomas McQuesten and his deputy minister Robert Melville Smith changed the design to be similar to the autobahns of Germany , dividing the opposite directions of travel and using grade-separated interchanges at major crossroads . When opened to traffic in 1937 , it was the first intercity divided highway in North America and featured the longest stretch of consistent illumination in the world . While not a true freeway at the time , it was gradually upgraded , widened , and modernized beginning in the 1950s , more or less taking on its current form by 1975 . Since then , various projects have continued to widen the route . In 1997 , the provincial government turned over the responsibility for the section of the QEW between Highway 427 and the Humber River to the City of Toronto .",

People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years .

Highway 7 was first designated in 1920 between Sarnia and Guelph and extended to Brampton the following year .

The highway once travelled from near Prescott to Ottawa . However , its length was truncated significantly when most of the route was twinned with a second roadway , and renumbered as Highway 416 . However , a short stub remains through Johnstown , crossing the St. Lawrence River on the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge to Ogdensburg , New York , where it becomes New York State Route 812 .

  "/wiki/NY_812": "New York State Route 812 ( NY 812 ) is a state highway in the North Country of New York in the United States . The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 12 and NY 26 in the Lewis County village of Lowville . Its northern terminus is at the Canada-United States border in Ogdensburg , where it crosses the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge and connects to Highway 16 in Ontario . While most of NY 812 passes through rural areas of the North Country , the route also serves several villages and small communities . The GPS services company Geotab has named it the quietest highway in New York due to its low traffic counts . The origins of NY 812 date back to the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , when the portion of modern NY 812 from Lowville to Croghan became part of NY 26A and the segment of modern NY 812 between De Kalb and Ogdensburg was designated as the northernmost portion of New York State Route 87 . NY 87 originally extended as far south as Harrisville ; however , it was truncated north to Edwards in the 1940s and farther north to De Kalb in the 1970s . On July 1 , 1977 , all of NY 87 and the Lowville-Croghan leg of NY 26A were replaced with NY 812 , a new route that began in Lowville and passed through Croghan , Harrisville , Gouverneur , and De Kalb before ending near Ogdensburg . At the time , two sections of the route - from the Croghan village line to a point west of Harrisville and from Harrisville to Fowler - were maintained by the counties that they passed through , and a piece between NY 126 and the Croghan village line was maintained by the village itself . The state of New York assumed maintenance of the Croghan-Harrisville segment in 1980 and took over the Harrisville-Fowler section in 1982 .",

Highway 416 passes through a largely rural area , except near its northern terminus where it enters the suburbs of Ottawa . The freeway also serves several communities along its length , notably Spencerville and Kemptville . Highway 416 had two distinct construction phases .

Sections of both opened throughout the late 1990s . Highway 416 was commemorated as the Veterans Memorial Highway on the 54th anniversary of D-Day in 1998 .
