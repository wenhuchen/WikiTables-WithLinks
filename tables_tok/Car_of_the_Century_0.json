  "section_title": "The selection process",
  "section_text": "An elaborate and formal process for deciding the Car of the Century was devised . It started in October 1996 , when a list of 700 cars was offered by the COTC organising committee as candidates for the award , which their experts had selected from recommendations made from within the car industry and from car clubs . [ 4 ] In February 1997 a list of 200 eligible cars was announced at the AutoRAI motor show in Amsterdam , having been selected from the 700 by an honorary committee of experts who were all independent and highly respected and experienced automotive experts . [ 5 ] The next step was for a jury of 133 professional automotive journalists [ 6 ] from 33 different countries , under the presidency of Lord Montagu of Beaulieu , [ 7 ] to reduce the list to 100 , and the result was announced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1997 . [ 8 ] The elimination process proceeded with an Internet-based public vote [ 9 ] to select 10 cars , and for 25 cars to be selected by the jury of professionals . In the event , 9 out of the 10 cars selected by the public were also amongst the 25 selected by the journalists ( the AC Cobra being the extra car selected by the public ) , so 26 cars were announced at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1999 , as the nominees for the next round .
