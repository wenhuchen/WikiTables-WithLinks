The company was founded in 1949 when the supermarket owning Asquith family merged with the Associated Dairies company of Yorkshire . It expanded into the south of England during the 1970s and 1980s , and acquired Allied Carpets , 61 large Gateway Supermarkets and other businesses , such as MFI , then sold off its acquisitions during the 1990s to concentrate on the supermarkets . It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until 1999 when it was acquired by the American retail giant Walmart for \u00a36.7 billion . Asda was the second-largest supermarket chain in Britain between 2003 and 2014 by market share , at which point it fell into third place . Since April 2019 , it has regained its second-place position , behind Tesco and ahead of Sainsbury 's . Besides its core supermarkets , the company also offers a number of other services , including financial services and a mobile phone provider that uses the existing EE network . Asda 's marketing promotions are usually based solely on price , and since 2015 , like its parent company , Walmart , Asda has promoted itself under the slogan Save Money . Live Better . Since 1987 , Asda has also had its property development subsidiary , McLagan Investments Ltd , which is based at the main Leeds head office site . As a wholly owned division of Walmart , Asda is not required to publish quarterly , half-yearly or full-yearly earnings , but many large UK subsidiaries of US companies submit accounts to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on a voluntary basis . In April 2018 , Sainsbury 's and Asda announced a merger plan that would have given the combined supermarkets an estimated 30% share of the UK grocery market , however it was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority .",
