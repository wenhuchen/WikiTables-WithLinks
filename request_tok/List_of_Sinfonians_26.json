  "/wiki/Congressional_Gold_Medal": "A Congressional Gold Medal is an award bestowed by the United States Congress . The congressional practice of issuing gold medals to occasionally honor recipients from the military began during the American Revolution . Later the practice extended to individuals in all walks of life and in the late 20th century also to groups . The Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the highest civilian awards in the United States . The congressional medal seeks to honor those , individually or as a group , who have performed an achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient 's field long after the achievement . However , There are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals . When a Congressional Gold Medal has been deemed appropriate , Congress has , by legislative action , provided for the creation of a medal on an ad hoc basis . Thus , there are generally fewer gold medals than presidential medals . U.S. citizenship is not a requirement . As of April 4 , 2019 , 163 institutions , people , or events have been awarded a Congressional Gold Medal ."
