  "/wiki/Henry_VI,_Part_1": "Henry VI , Part 1 , often referred to as 1 Henry VI , is a history play by William Shakespeare - possibly in collaboration with Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Nashe - believed to have been written in 1591 . It is set during the lifetime of King Henry VI of England . Whereas Henry VI , Part 2 deals with the King 's inability to quell the bickering of his nobles and the inevitability of armed conflict and Henry VI , Part 3 deals with the horrors of that conflict , Henry VI , Part 1 deals with the loss of England 's French territories and the political machinations leading up to the Wars of the Roses , as the English political system is torn apart by personal squabbles and petty jealousy . Although the Henry VI trilogy may not have been written in chronological order , the three plays are often grouped together with Richard III to form a tetralogy covering the entire Wars of the Roses saga , from the death of Henry V in 1422 to the rise to power of Henry VII in 1485 . It was the success of this sequence of plays that firmly established Shakespeare 's reputation as a playwright . Some regard Henry VI , Part 1 as the weakest of Shakespeare 's plays . Along with Titus Andronicus , it is generally considered one of the strongest candidates for evidence that Shakespeare collaborated with other dramatists early in his career .",

Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",

  "/wiki/Joan_of_Arc_(poem)": "Joan of Arc is a 1796 epic poem composed by Robert Southey . The idea for the story came from a discussion between Southey and Grosvenor Bedford , when Southey realised that the story would be suitable for an epic . The subject further appealed to Southey because the events of the French Revolution were concurrent to the writing of the poem and would serve as a parallel to current events . Eventually , Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped rewrite parts of the poem for a 1798 edition . Later editions removed Coleridge 's additions along with other changes . The poem is divided into two-halves with the first describing Joan 's quest to meet Charles , the Dauphin of France . Eventually , she is capable of gaining the Dauphin 's support and begins to lead the French military . The secondary half describes the French defeat of the British army at Orl\u00e9ans . After many victories , the poem ends with Charles crowned King of France . Joan of Arc serves as a way for Southey to express his views on history and on politics ; these include his republican ideals , his claims that political tyranny was a common element in Europe , and his opposition to Christian practices that he thought were superstitious . Later editions of the poem shifted from a promotion of a deistic view of religion to a more traditional view . Critics gave the work mixed reviews , with some emphasising the quality of the images and themes of the poem .",

  "/wiki/Romanticism": "Romanticism ( also known as the Romantic era ) was an artistic , literary , musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century , and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850 . Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature , preferring the medieval rather than the classical . It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution , the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment , and the scientific rationalization of nature - all components of modernity . It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts , music , and literature , but had a major impact on historiography , education , the social sciences , and the natural sciences . [ failed verification ] It had a significant and complex effect on politics , with romantic thinkers influencing liberalism , radicalism , conservatism and nationalism . The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience , placing new emphasis on such emotions as apprehension , horror and terror , and awe - especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublimity and beauty of nature . It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble , but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic ( as in the musical impromptu ) . In contrast to the Rationalism and Classicism of the Enlightenment , Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth , early urban sprawl , and industrialism . Although the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement , which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment , the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors . Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of heroic individualists and artists , whose examples , it maintained , would raise the quality of society . It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art . There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability , a Zeitgeist , in the representation of its ideas .",

There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood .

His interest for Joan came at a time when France was still struggling to define its new identity after the Revolution and the Napoleonic wars . The national ethos was in search of non controversial heroes . A staunch prop to King and country , Joan of Arc was an acceptable symbol to the monarchists . As a patriot and the daughter of commoners , she was seen as one prototype of the low-born volunteers ( the soldats de l'an II ) who had victoriously fought for revolutionary France in 1802 and as such could be claimed by the Republicans . As a religious martyr , she was also popular in the powerful Catholic community .

Twain was raised in Hannibal , Missouri , which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn . He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter , contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens . He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada . He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining , turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise . His humorous story , The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , was published in 1865 , based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp , California , where he had spent some time as a miner . The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French .

From 1427 to 1435 , Rais served as a commander in the French army , and fought alongside Joan of Arc against the English and their Burgundian allies during the Hundred Years ' War , for which he was appointed Marshal of France . In 1434 or 1435 he retired from military life , depleted his wealth by staging an extravagant theatrical spectacle of his own composition , and was accused of dabbling in the occult . After 1432 , Rais was accused of engaging in a series of child murders , with victims possibly numbering in the hundreds . The killings came to an end in 1440 , when a violent dispute with a clergyman led to an ecclesiastical investigation that brought the crimes to light , and attributed them to Rais . At his trial the parents of missing children in the surrounding area and Rais 's own confederates in crime testified against him . He was condemned to death and hanged at Nantes on 26 October 1440 . Rais is believed to be the inspiration for the 1697 fairy tale Bluebeard ( Barbe bleue ) by Charles Perrault .",

  "/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw": "George Bernard Shaw ( /\u02c8b\u0259rn\u0251\u02d0rd/ ; 26 July 1856 - 2 November 1950 ) , known at his insistence simply as Bernard Shaw , was an Irish playwright , critic , polemicist and political activist . His influence on Western theatre , culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond . He wrote more than sixty plays , including major works such as Man and Superman ( 1902 ) , Pygmalion ( 1912 ) and Saint Joan ( 1923 ) . With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory , Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation , and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature . Born in Dublin , Shaw moved to London in 1876 , where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist , and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education . By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic . Following a political awakening , he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer . Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success , Arms and the Man in 1894 . Influenced by Henrik Ibsen , he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama , using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political , social and religious ideas . By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara , The Doctor 's Dilemma and Caesar and Cleopatra . Shaw 's expressed views were often contentious ; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform , and opposed vaccination and organised religion . He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable , and although not a republican , castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period .",
  "/wiki/Protestant": "Protestantism is the second-largest form of Christianity with a total of 800 million to 1 billion adherents worldwide or about 37% of all Christians . [ a ] It originated with the 16th century Reformation , [ b ] a movement against what its followers perceived to be errors in the Catholic Church . Protestants reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments , but disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . They emphasize the priesthood of all believers , justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than also by good works , and the highest authority of the Bible alone ( rather than also with sacred tradition ) in faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The five solae summarise basic theological differences in opposition to the Roman Catholic Church . Protestantism began in Germany [ c ] in 1517 when Martin Luther published his Ninety-five Theses as a reaction against abuses in the sale of indulgences by the Roman Catholic Church , which purported to offer the remission of the temporal punishment of sins to their purchasers . However , the term derives from the letter of protestation from German Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict of the Diet of Speyer condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical . Although there were earlier breaks and attempts to reform the Roman Catholic Church - notably by Peter Waldo , John Wycliffe , and Jan Hus - only Luther succeeded in sparking a wider , lasting , and modern movement . In the 16th century , Lutheranism spread from Germany [ d ] into Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Finland , Latvia , Estonia , and Iceland . Reformed ( or Calvinist ) denominations spread in Germany , [ e ] Hungary , the Netherlands , Scotland , Switzerland and France by reformers such as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . The political separation of the Church of England from the pope under King Henry VIII began Anglicanism , bringing England and Wales into this broad Reformation movement . [ f ] Protestants have developed their own culture , with major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and many other fields .",
  "/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number": "The International Standard Book Number ( ISBN ) is a numeric commercial book identifier which is intended to be unique . [ a ] [ b ] Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency . An ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation ( except reprintings ) of a publication . For example , an e-book , a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book will each have a different ISBN . The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007 , and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007 . The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries , often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country . The initial ISBN identification format was devised in 1967 , based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering ( SBN ) created in 1966 . The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 ( the 9-digit SBN code can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit ' 0 ' ) . Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN . The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative . Another identifier , the International Standard Serial Number ( ISSN ) , identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers . The International Standard Music Number ( ISMN ) covers musical scores .",

  "/wiki/Saint_Joan_of_the_Stockyards": "Saint Joan of the Stockyards ( German : Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth\u00f6fe ) is a play written by the German modernist playwright Bertolt Brecht between 1929 and 1931 , after the success of his musical The Threepenny Opera and during the period of his radical experimental work with the Lehrst\u00fccke . It is based on the musical that he co-authored with Elisabeth Hauptmann , Happy End ( 1929 ) . In this version of the story of Joan of Arc , Brecht transforms her into Joan Dark , a member of the Black Straw Hats ( a Salvation Army-like group ) in 20th-century Chicago . The play charts Joan 's battle with Pierpont Mauler , the unctuous owner of a meat-packing plant . Like her predecessor , Joan is a doomed woman , a martyr and ( initially , at least ) an innocent in a world of strike-breakers , fat cats , and penniless workers . Like many of Brecht 's plays it is laced with humor and songs as part of its epic dramaturgical structure and deals with the theme of emancipation from material suffering and exploitation . The play was broadcast on Berlin Radio on the 11 April 1932 , with Carola Neher as Joan and Fritz Kortner as Mauler . The cast also included Helene Weigel , Ernst Busch , Peter Lorre , Paul Bildt and Friedrich Gnass . The play did not receive its first theatrical production until the 30 April 1959 , at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg , after Brecht 's death . Brecht had asked Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens to direct , with scenic design by Caspar Neher and music by Siegfried Franz . Brecht 's daughter Hanne Hiob played Joan . Brecht wrote two other versions of the Joan of Arc story : The Visions of Simone Machard ( 1942 ) and The Trial of Joan of Arc of Proven , 1431 ( 1952 ) .",
  "/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht": "Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht [ a ] ( 10 February 1898 - 14 August 1956 ) , known professionally as Bertolt Brecht , was a German theatre practitioner , playwright , and poet . Coming of age during the Weimar Republic , he had his first successes as a playwright in Munich and moved to Berlin in 1924 , where he wrote The Threepenny Opera with Kurt Weill and began a lifelong collaboration with the composer Hanns Eisler . Immersed in Marxist thought during this period , he wrote didactic Lehrst\u00fccke and became a leading theoretician of epic theatre ( which he later preferred to call dialectical theatre ) and the so-called V-effect . During the Nazi period he lived in exile , first in Scandinavia , and during World War II in the United States , where he was surveilled by the FBI and subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee . Returning to East Berlin after the war , he established the theatre company Berliner Ensemble with his wife and long-time collaborator , actress Helene Weigel .",

With an estimated population of 2,705,994 ( 2018 ) , it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States . Chicago is the county seat of Cook County , the second-most-populous county in the US , with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport . Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",
