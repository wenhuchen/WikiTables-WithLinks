The first phase was inaugurated by General Parvez Musharraf in 2007 at a total cost of $ 248 million . The port initially remained underutilized after construction for a variety of reasons , including lack of investment , security concerns , and the Government of Pakistan 's failure to transfer land as promised to the port operator , Port of Singapore Authority . In April 2015 , Pakistan and China announced their intention to develop the $ 46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) , which in turn forms part of China 's ambitious One Belt , One Road .
