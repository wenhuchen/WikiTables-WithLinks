In the first half of the 18th century , they acquired horses and firearms from white traders and their Cree and Assiniboine go-betweens . The Blackfoot used these to expand their territory at the expense of neighboring tribes . Today , three First Nation band governments ( the Siksika Nation , Kainai Nation , and Piikani Nation ) reside in Canada in the provinces of Saskatchewan , Alberta , and British Columbia , and the Blackfeet Tribe of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation is a federally recognized Native American tribe in Montana , United States . Additionally , the Gros Ventre are members of the federally recognized Fort Belknap Indian Community of the Fort Belknap Reservation of Montana in the United States and the Tsuut\u02bcina Nation is a First Nation band government in Alberta , Canada .",

  "/wiki/Rail_transport": "Rail transport or train transport is a means of transferring passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails , which are located on tracks . In contrast to road transport , where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface , rail vehicles ( rolling stock ) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run . Tracks usually consist of steel rails , installed on ties ( sleepers ) set in ballast , on which the rolling stock , usually fitted with metal wheels , moves . Other variations are also possible , such as slab track . This is where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface .",
  "/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Sleeping_Car_Porters": "Founded in 1925 , The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters ( BSCP ) was the first labor organization led by African Americans to receive a charter in the American Federation of Labor ( AFL ) . The BSCP gathered a membership of 18,000 passenger railway workers across Canada , Mexico , and the United States . Beginning after the American Civil War , the job of Pullman porter had become an important means of work in the black community in the United States . As a result of a decline in railway transportation in the 1960s , BSCP membership declined . It merged in 1978 with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks ( BRAC ) , now known as the Transportation Communications International Union . The leaders of the BSCP - including A. Philip Randolph , its founder and first president , and C. L. Dellums , its vice president and second president - became leaders in the Civil Rights Movement and continued to play a significant role in it after it focused on the eradication of segregation in the Southern United States . BSCP members such as E. D. Nixon were among the leadership of local desegregation movements by virtue of their organizing experience , constant movement between communities , and freedom from economic dependence on local authorities .",

  "/wiki/Civil_rights_movement": "The civil rights movement ( also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms ) [ b ] in the United States was a decades-long struggle by African Americans to end legalized racial discrimination , disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States . The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century , although the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests . The social movement 's major nonviolent resistance campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans . After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s , the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans , most of whom had recently been enslaved . For a period , African Americans voted and held political office , but they were increasingly deprived of civil rights , often under Jim Crow laws , and subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by whites in the South . Over the following century , various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal rights . In 1954 , the separate but equal policy which aided the enforcement of Jim Crow laws was weakened with the United States Supreme Court 's Brown v. Board of Education ruling and other subsequent rulings which followed . Between 1955 and 1968 , acts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities . Federal , state , and local governments , businesses , and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations , which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans across the country . The lynching of Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Mississippi , and the outrage generated by seeing how he had been abused , when his mother decided to have an open-casket funeral , mobilized the African-American community nationwide . Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts , such as the successful Montgomery bus boycott ( 1955-56 ) in Alabama ; sit-ins such as the Greensboro sit-ins ( 1960 ) in North Carolina and successful Nashville sit-ins in Tennessee ; marches , such as the 1963 Birmingham Children 's Crusade and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches ( 1965 ) in Alabama ; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities . At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans , the U.S. Supreme Court began , in 1954 under the leadership of Earl Warren , to find unconstitutional many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States .",

  "/wiki/Tom_Thumb_(locomotive)": "Tom Thumb was the first American-built steam locomotive to operate on a common-carrier railroad . It was designed and constructed by Peter Cooper in 1830 to convince owners of the newly formed Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( B & O ) ( now CSX ) to use steam engines ; it was not intended to enter revenue service . It is especially remembered as a participant in an impromptu race with a horse-drawn car , which the horse won after Tom Thumb suffered a mechanical failure . However , the demonstration was successful , and the railroad committed to the use of steam locomotion and held trials in the following year for a working engine . :11",
  "/wiki/Steam_locomotive": "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine . These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material - usually coal , wood , or oil - to produce steam in a boiler . The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive 's main wheels ( drivers ) . Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive , either on the locomotive itself or in wagons ( tenders ) pulled behind . Steam locomotives were first developed in the United Kingdom during the early 19th century and used for railway transport until the middle of the 20th century . Richard Trevithick built the first steam locomotive in 1802 . The first commercially successful steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. , the Salamanca ( locomotive ) , the Locomotion No . 1 , built by George Stephenson and his son Robert 's company Robert Stephenson and Company , was the first steam locomotive to haul passengers on a public railway , the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 . In 1830 , George Stephenson opened the first public inter-city railway , the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . Robert Stephenson and Company was the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives for railways in the United Kingdom , the United States , and much of Europe in the first decades of steam . In the 20th century , Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) Nigel Gresley designed some of the most famous locomotives , including the Flying Scotsman , the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service , and a LNER Class A4 , 4468 Mallard , which still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world ( 126 mph ) . From the early 1900s , steam locomotives were gradually superseded by electric and diesel locomotives , with railways fully converting to electric and diesel power beginning in the late 1930s .",

  "/wiki/Sarnia,_Ontario": "Sarnia is a city in Southwestern Ontario , Canada , and had a 2016 population of 71,594 . It is the largest city on Lake Huron and in Lambton County . Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River , which forms the Canada-United States border , directly across from Port Huron , Michigan . The site 's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle . He named the site The Rapids on 23 August 1679 , when he had horses and men pull his 45-ton barque Le Griffon north against the nearly four-knot current of the St. Clair River . This was the first time that a vessel other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron , and La Salle 's voyage was germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes . Located in the natural harbour , the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products . The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas , together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 , led to the dramatic growth of the petroleum industry in this area . Because Oil Springs was the first place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil , the knowledge that was acquired there resulted in oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other enterprises and nations how to drill for oil . The complex of refining and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia . In 2011 the city had the highest level of particulates air pollution of any Canadian city , but it has since dropped to rank 30th in this hazard . About 60 percent of the particulate matter comes industries and polluters in the neighbouring United States .",

  "/wiki/Folk_music": "Folk music includes traditional folk music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th-century folk revival . Some types of folk music may be called world music . Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways : as music transmitted orally , music with unknown composers , or music performed by custom over a long period of time . It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles . The term originated in the 19th century , but folk music extends beyond that . Starting in the mid-20th century , a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music . This process and period is called the ( second ) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s . This form of music is sometimes called contemporary folk music or folk revival music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms . Smaller , similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times , but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals . This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as folk rock , folk metal , and others . While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music , in U.S. English it shares the same name , and it often shares the same performers and venues as traditional folk music .",
  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres .
