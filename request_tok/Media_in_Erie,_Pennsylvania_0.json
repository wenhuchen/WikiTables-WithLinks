  "/wiki/Callsign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",
  "/wiki/Effective_radiated_power": "Effective radiated power ( ERP ) , synonymous with equivalent radiated power , is an IEEE standardized definition of directional radio frequency ( RF ) power , such as that emitted by a radio transmitter . It is the total power in watts that would have to be radiated by a half-wave dipole antenna to give the same radiation intensity ( signal strength or power flux density in watts per square meter ) as the actual source antenna at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna 's strongest beam ( main lobe ) . ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction . It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the gain of the antenna . It is used in electronics and telecommunications , particularly in broadcasting to quantify the apparent power of a broadcasting station experienced by listeners in its reception area . An alternate parameter that measures the same thing is equivalent ( sometimes effective ) isotropically radiated power ( EIRP ) . Equivalent isotropically radiated power is the hypothetical power that would have to be radiated by an isotropic antenna to give the same ( equivalent ) signal strength as the actual source antenna in the direction of the antenna 's strongest beam . The difference between EIRP and ERP is that ERP compares the actual antenna to a half-wave dipole antenna , while EIRP compares it to a theoretical isotropic antenna . Since a half-wave dipole antenna has a gain of 1.64 ( or 2.15 dB ) compared to an isotropic radiator , if ERP and EIRP are expressed in watts their relation is",
  "/wiki/City_of_license": "In American , Canadian and Philippine broadcasting , a city of license or community of license is the community that a radio station or television station is officially licensed to serve by that country 's broadcast regulator . In North American broadcast law , the concept of community of license dates to the early days of AM radio broadcasting . The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a main studio within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in U.S. law as early as 1939 . Various specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill public policy objectives of broadcast localism , both in radio and later also in television , based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers .",

  "/wiki/Classic_hits": "Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes songs from the top 40 music charts from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s , with music from the 1980s serving as the core of the format . Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format . It is considered the successor to the oldies format , a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States . The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format , which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs . In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries . The classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH , WCBS-FM in New York , and WLS-FM in Chicago having successful ratings with this model . Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audio 's research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format . In addition , the Millennial generation is listening to this format in record numbers , according to a Nielsen report . As of December 2019 there are now over 1,100 classic hits stations in the United States , the largest amount in format history .",

  "/wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock ( also called alternative music , alt-rock , alt-pop or simply alternative ) is a term used to categorize rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1980s . In this instance , the word alternative refers to the genre 's distinction from mainstream , or commercial rock or pop music . The term 's original meaning was broader , referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent , DIY ethos of punk rock , which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music . In September of 1988 , Billboard magazine introduced Alternative Songs into their charting system rather than continue incorporating these artists into the existing rock and pop charts . By then alternative had become a catch-all description for both successful artists ( e.g . U2 and R.E.M . ) , as well as music from underground , independent , or non-commercial rock artists that received some level of mainstream recognition . Although the genre evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s , music anticipating the sound of the genre can be found as early as the 1960s , with bands such as the Velvet Underground and artists such as Syd Barrett . Since the early 1990s the term has often been misused to market an artist 's image or music toward consumers seeking to distinguish their tastes from mainstream pop or rock music . Traditionally , alternative rock broadly consisted of music that differed greatly in terms of its sound , social context and regional roots . Throughout the 1980s , magazines and zines , college radio airplay , and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock , helping to define a number of distinct styles ( and music scenes ) such as noise pop , indie rock , grunge , and shoegaze . Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands , such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and R.E.M. , were signed to major labels .",

Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists .

A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet .

Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s .

  "/wiki/Rock_music": "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the early 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom . It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll , a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues , rhythm and blues , and from country music . Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical styles . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass , drums , and one or more singers . Usually , rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political . By the late 1960s classic rock period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , southern rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s .",

George Smith , a radio engineer by trade , received a vision that the Erie area needed Christian radio . After poring over topographic maps and spending time in thought and prayer , Smith found out about a small FM station in Union City that had become available . He contacted local pastors in the area and then approached the Full Gospel Businessmen 's Association . Eventually , the Inspiration Time board reached agreement to buy the 250-watt FM station in Union City called WBVB and daily operation and management began on October 3 of that year . The station changed call letters to WCTL in January 1972 and increased power to 3,000 watts later that year .
