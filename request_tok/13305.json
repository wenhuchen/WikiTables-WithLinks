  "/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo": "The Count of Monte Cristo ( French : Le Comte de Monte-Cristo ) is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas ( p\u00e8re ) completed in 1844 . It is one of the author 's more popular works , along with The Three Musketeers . Like many of his novels , it was expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet . Another important work by Dumas , written before his work with Maquet , was the short novel Georges ; this novel is of particular interest to scholars because Dumas reused many of the ideas and plot devices later in The Count of Monte Cristo . The story takes place in France , Italy , and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839 : the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France . It begins just before the Hundred Days period ( when Napoleon returned to power after his exile ) . The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book , an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope , justice , vengeance , mercy , and forgiveness . It centres on a man who is wrongfully imprisoned , escapes from jail , acquires a fortune , and sets about exacting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment . His plans have devastating consequences for both the innocent and the guilty . The book is considered a literary classic today . According to Luc Sante , The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization 's literature , as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse , Noah 's flood , and the story of Little Red Riding Hood .",

His works have been translated into many languages , and he is one of the most widely read French authors . Many of his historical novels of high adventure were originally published as serials , including The Count of Monte Cristo , The Three Musketeers , Twenty Years After , and The Vicomte of Bragelonne : Ten Years Later . His novels have been adapted since the early twentieth century into nearly 200 films . Prolific in several genres , Dumas began his career by writing plays , which were successfully produced from the first . He also wrote numerous magazine articles and travel books ; his published works totalled 100,000 pages . In the 1840s , Dumas founded the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique in Paris .

At age 14 Thomas-Alexandre was taken by his father to France , where he was educated in a military academy and entered the military for what became an illustrious career . Dumas 's father 's aristocratic rank helped young Alexandre acquire work with Louis-Philippe , Duke of Orl\u00e9ans , then as a writer , finding early success . Decades later , after the election of Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte in 1851 , Dumas fell from favour and left France for Belgium , where he stayed for several years , then moved to Russia for a few years before going to Italy . In 1861 , he founded and published the newspaper L'Ind\u00e9pendent , which supported Italian unification , before returning to Paris in 1864 .",

The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in Pierre-Jules Hetzel 's periodical , the Magasin d'\u00e9ducation et de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation . A deluxe octavo edition , published by Hetzel in November 1871 , included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and \u00c9douard Riou .

Verne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe , where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism . His reputation was markedly different in Anglophone regions where he had often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children 's books , largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels have often been printed ( until the 1980s , when his literary reputation . began to improve ) . Verne has been the second most-translated author in the world since 1979 , ranking between Agatha Christie and William Shakespeare . He has sometimes been called the Father of Science Fiction , a title that has also been given to H. G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback .",

As a young adult , Boone supplemented his farm income by hunting and trapping game , and selling their pelts in the fur market . Through this work , Boone first learned the easy routes westward . Despite some resistance from Native American tribes such as the Shawnee , in 1775 , Boone blazed his Wilderness Road from North Carolina and Tennessee through Cumberland Gap in the Cumberland Mountains into Kentucky . There , he founded the village of Boonesborough , Kentucky , one of the first American settlements west of the Appalachians . Before the end of the 18th century , more than 200,000 Americans migrated to Kentucky/Virginia by following the route marked by Boone . Boone served as a militia officer during the Revolutionary War ( 1775-83 ) , which , in Kentucky , was fought primarily between the American settlers and British-allied Native Americans , who hoped to expel the Americans . Shawnee warriors captured Boone in 1778 . He escaped and alerted Boonesborough that the Shawnee were planning an attack ."
