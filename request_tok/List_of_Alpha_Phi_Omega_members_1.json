  "/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , often informally known as the LDS Church or Mormon Church , is a nontrinitarian , Christian restorationist church that considers itself to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ . The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City , Utah , in the United States , and has established congregations and built temples worldwide . According to the church , it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries . In 2012 , the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States , with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018 . It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening . Adherents , often referred to as Latter-day Saints or , less formally , Mormons , view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion . Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ , though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity . The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts : the Bible ( both Old and New Testaments ) , the Book of Mormon , the Doctrine and Covenants , and the Pearl of Great Price . Other than the Bible , the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible , texts described as lost parts of the Bible , and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets . Because of some of the doctrinal differences , Catholic , Orthodox , and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity . Under the doctrine of continuing revelation , Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day prophet , seer , and revelator and that Jesus Christ , under the direction of God the Father , leads the church by revealing his will to its president . Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives .",
