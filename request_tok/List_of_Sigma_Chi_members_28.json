The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City , Utah , in the United States , and has established congregations and built temples worldwide . According to the church , it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries . In 2012 , the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States , with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018 . It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening . Adherents , often referred to as Latter-day Saints or , less formally , Mormons , view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion . Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ , though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity . The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts : the Bible ( both Old and New Testaments ) , the Book of Mormon , the Doctrine and Covenants , and the Pearl of Great Price . Other than the Bible , the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible , texts described as lost parts of the Bible , and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets . Because of some of the doctrinal differences , Catholic , Orthodox , and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity . Under the doctrine of continuing revelation , Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day prophet , seer , and revelator and that Jesus Christ , under the direction of God the Father , leads the church by revealing his will to its president . Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives .",

In 1939 , the MEC reunited with two breakaway Methodist denominations ( the Methodist Protestant Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church , South ) to form the Methodist Church . In 1968 , the Methodist Church merged with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to form the United Methodist Church . The MEC 's origins lie in the First Great Awakening when Methodism emerged as an evangelical revival movement within the Church of England that stressed the necessity of being born again and the possibility of attaining Christian perfection . By the 1760s , Methodism had spread to the Thirteen Colonies , and Methodist societies were formed under the oversight of John Wesley . As in England , American Methodists remained affiliated with the Church of England , but this state of affairs became untenable after the American Revolution . In response , Wesley ordained the first Methodist elders for America in 1784 . Under the leadership of its first bishops , Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury , the Methodist Episcopal Church adopted episcopal polity and an itinerant model of ministry that saw circuit riders provide for the religious needs of a widespread and mobile population . Early Methodism was countercultural in that it was anti-elitist and anti-slavery , appealing especially to African Americans and women . While critics derided Methodists as fanatics , the Methodist Episcopal Church continued to grow , especially during the Second Great Awakening in which Methodist revivalism and camp meetings left its imprint on American culture . In the early 19th century , the MEC became the largest and most influential religious denomination in the United States .",
