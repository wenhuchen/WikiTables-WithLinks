  "/wiki/Genre": "Genre ( Pronounced / ( d ) \u0292\u0251n.\u0279\u0259/ ) ( from French genre , meaning 'kind , sort ' ) is any form or type of communication in any mode ( written , spoken , digital , artistic , etc . ) with socially-agreed-upon conventions developed over time . Genre is most popularly known as a category of literature , music , or other forms of art or entertainment , whether written or spoken , audio or visual , based on some set of stylistic criteria , yet genres can be aesthetic , rhetorical , communicative , or functional . Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones . Often , works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions . Stand-alone texts , works , or pieces of communication may have individual styles , but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions . Some genres may have rigid , strictly adhered-to guidelines , while others may show great flexibility . Genre began as an absolute classification system for ancient Greek literature , as set out in Aristotle 's Poetics . For Aristotle , poetry ( odes , epics , etc . ) , prose , and performance each had specific design features that supported appropriate content of each genre . Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy , for example , and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best .

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

The sash falls and circumcises him ; his family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance .
