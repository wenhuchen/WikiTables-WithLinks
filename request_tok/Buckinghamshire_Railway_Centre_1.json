  "/wiki/London,_Chatham_and_Dover_Railway": "The London , Chatham and Dover Railway ( LCDR ) was a railway company in south-eastern England created on 1 August 1859 , when the East Kent Railway was given Parliamentary approval to change its name . Its lines ran through London and northern and eastern Kent to form a significant part of the Greater London commuter network . The company existed until 31 December 1922 when its assets were merged with those of other companies to form the Southern Railway as a result of the grouping determined by the Railways Act 1921 . The railway was always in a difficult financial situation and went bankrupt in 1867 , but was able to continue to operate . Many of the difficulties were caused by the severe competition and duplication of services with the South Eastern Railway ( SER ) . However , in 1898 the LCDR agreed with the SER to share the operation of the two railways , work them as a single system ( as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway ) and pool receipts : but it was not a full amalgamation . The SER and LCDR remained separate companies with separate shareholders until both becoming constituents of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923 . 'The Chatham ' , as it was sometimes known , was often criticised for its lamentable carriage stock and poor punctuality , but in two respects it was very good : it used the highly effective Westinghouse air brake on its passenger stock , and the Sykes 'Lock and Block ' system of signalling . As a result , it had an excellent safety record .",
  "/wiki/West_Coast_Main_Line": "The West Coast Main Line ( WCML ) is one of the most important railway corridors in the United Kingdom , connecting the major cities of London , Birmingham , Liverpool , Manchester , Edinburgh and Glasgow . It is one of the busiest mixed-traffic railway routes in Europe , carrying a mixture of intercity rail , regional rail , commuter rail and rail freight traffic . The core route of the WCML runs from London to Glasgow , with branches diverging to Northampton , Birmingham , Manchester and Liverpool , totalling a route mileage of 700 miles ( 1,127 km ) . Services from London to North Wales and Edinburgh also run via the WCML ; however the main London-Edinburgh route is the East Coast Main Line . In addition , several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London , Coventry , Birmingham , Liverpool , Manchester and Glasgow , with many more smaller commuter stations , as well as providing links to more rural towns . It is one of the busiest freight routes in Europe , carrying 40% of all UK rail freight traffic . The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland ( via the Channel Tunnel ) through London and South East England to the West Midlands , North West England and Scotland . The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks ( TENS ) route . Much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph ( 201 km/h ) , meeting the European Union 's definition of an upgraded high-speed line , although only Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers with tilting mechanisms operated by Avanti West Coast travel at that speed . Other traffic is limited to 110 mph ( 177 km/h ) .",
  "/wiki/London_and_North_Western_Railway": "The London and North Western Railway ( LNWR , L & NWR ) was a British railway company between 1846 and 1922 . In the late 19th century , the L & NWR was the largest joint stock company in the United Kingdom . In 1923 , it became a constituent of the London , Midland and Scottish ( LMS ) railway , and , in 1948 , the London Midland Region of British Railways : the LNWR is effectively an ancestor of today 's West Coast Main Line .",
  "/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_(Great_Britain)": "The Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) was a British railway company incorporated in 1846 with the object of building a line from London to York . It quickly saw that seizing control of territory was key to development , and it acquired , or took leases of , many local railways , whether actually built or not . In doing so it overextended itself financially . Nevertheless , it succeeded in reaching into the coalfields of Nottinghamshire , Derbyshire and Yorkshire , as well as establishing dominance in Lincolnshire and North London . Bringing coal south to London was dominant , but general agricultural business and short and long distance passenger traffic were important activities . Its fast passenger express trains captured the public imagination , and its Chief Mechanical Engineer Nigel Gresley became a celebrity . Anglo-Scottish travel on the East Coast Main Line became commercially important ; the GNR controlled the line from London to Doncaster and allied itself with the North Eastern Railway and the North British Railway so as to offer seamless travel facilities . The main line railways of Great Britain were grouped following the Railways Act 1921 into one or other of four new larger concerns . The Great Northern Railway was a constituent of the London and North Eastern Railway , which took control at the beginning of 1923 . Although many local lines have been closed , much of the network is active today .",
  "/wiki/Great_Central_Railway": "The Great Central Railway in England came into being when the Manchester , Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway changed its name in 1897 , anticipating the opening in 1899 of its London Extension . On 1 January 1923 , the company was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway .",
  "/wiki/Manchester,_South_Junction_and_Altrincham_Railway": "The Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway ( MSJ & AR ) was a suburban railway which operated a 13.7 km ( 8\u00bd mile ) route between Altrincham in Cheshire and London Road Station ( now Piccadilly ) in Manchester . The MSJ & AR line is notable for having operated with three different systems of electrification within a period of about 60 years . The fast , frequent service resulting from the introduction of the first generation of electric trains in 1931 was a significant contributor to suburban development in the Stretford , Sale and Altrincham districts , south-west of Manchester . The southern part of the MSJ & AR 's route has been part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system since 1992 . The northern section between Manchester Piccadilly and Deansgate stations is now an intensively-used section of the National Rail network , used by trains running north and west of Manchester .",
  "/wiki/Manchester,_Sheffield_and_Lincolnshire_Railway": "The Manchester , Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway ( MS & LR ) was formed in 1847 when the Sheffield , Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway joined with authorised but unbuilt railway companies , forming a proposed network from Manchester to Grimsby . It pursued a policy of expanding its area of influence , especially in reaching west to Liverpool , which it ultimately did through the medium of the Cheshire Lines Committee network in joint partnership with the Great Northern Railway and the Midland Railway . Its dominant traffic was minerals , chiefly coal , and the main market was in London and the south of England . It was dependent on other lines to convey traffic southward . The London and North Western Railway was an exceptionally hostile partner , and in later years the MS & LR allied itself with the Great Northern Railway . Passenger traffic , especially around Manchester , was also an important business area , and well-patronised express trains to London were run in collaboration with the GNR . Nevertheless , the MS & LR was never greatly profitable .",
  "/wiki/Great_Western_Railway": "The Great Western Railway ( GWR ) was a British railway company that linked London with the southwest and west of England , the West Midlands , and most of Wales . It was founded in 1833 , received its enabling Act of Parliament on 31 August 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838 . It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel , who chose a broad gauge of 7 ft ( 2,134 mm ) - later slightly widened to 7 ft 1\u20444 in ( 2,140 mm ) - but , from 1854 , a series of amalgamations saw it also operate 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard-gauge trains ; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892 . The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921 , which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory , and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways . The GWR was called by some God 's Wonderful Railway and by others the Great Way Round but it was famed as the Holiday Line , taking many people to English and Bristol Channel resorts in the West Country as well as the far southwest of England such as Torquay in Devon , Minehead in Somerset , and Newquay and St Ives in Cornwall . The company 's locomotives , many of which were built in the company 's workshops at Swindon , were painted a Brunswick green colour while , for most of its existence , it used a two-tone chocolate and cream livery for its passenger coaches . Goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid-grey . Great Western trains included long-distance express services such as the Flying Dutchman , the Cornish Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express . It also operated many suburban and rural services , some operated by steam railmotors or autotrains . The company pioneered the use of larger , more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain . It operated a network of road motor ( bus ) routes , was a part of the Railway Air Services , and owned ships , docks and hotels .",
  "/wiki/Metro_Cammell": "Metro-Cammell , fully the Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company ( MCCW ) was an English manufacturer of railway carriages , locomotives and railway wagons , based in Saltley and subsequently Washwood Heath in Birmingham . Purchased by GEC-Alstom in May 1989 , the company went out of business in 2005 . The company has designed and built trains for the railways in the United Kingdom and overseas , including the Mass Transit Railway of Hong Kong , Kowloon-Canton Railway ( now East Rail Line ) , the Channel Tunnel , the Tyne and Wear Metro and locomotives for Malaysia 's Keretapi Tanah Melayu . Diesel and electric locomotives were manufactured for South African Railways , Nyasaland Railways , Malawi , Nigeria , Trans-Zambezi Railway and Pakistan ; DMUs for Jamaica Railway Corporation ; and DMUs for National Railways of Mexico . The vast majority of London Underground rolling stock manufactured in mid 20th century was produced by the company . It also designed and built the Blue Pullman for British Railways .",
  "/wiki/British_Railways": "British Railways ( BR ) , which from 1965 traded as British Rail , was the state-owned company that operated most of the overground rail transport in Great Britain between 1948 and 1997 . It was formed from the nationalisation of the Big Four British railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of British Rail , in stages between 1994 and 1997 . Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission , it became an independent statutory corporation in 1962 designated as the British Railways Board . The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network . A process of dieselisation and electrification took place , and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction , except for the Vale of Rheidol Railway ( a narrow-gauge tourist line ) . Passengers replaced freight as the main source of business , and one third of the network was closed by the Beeching Axe of the 1960s in an effort to reduce rail subsidies . On privatisation , responsibility for track , signalling and stations was transferred to Railtrack ( which was later brought under public control as Network Rail ) and that for trains to the train operating companies . The British Rail double arrow logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a double track railway and was nicknamed the arrow of indecision . It is now employed as a generic symbol on street signs in Great Britain denoting railway stations , and as part of the Rail Delivery Group 's ( RDG ) jointly-managed National Rail brand is still printed on railway tickets .",

  "/wiki/Severn_Valley_Railway": "The Severn Valley Railway is a heritage railway in Shropshire and Worcestershire , England . The 16-mile ( 26 km ) heritage line runs along the Severn Valley from Bridgnorth to Kidderminster , crossing the Shropshire/Worcestershire border , following the course of the River Severn for much of its route . Train services are hauled predominantly by steam locomotives , plus one diesel hauled train , making two round trips a day , on most days . Diesel locomotives are also used for engineering trains , to replace failed steam locomotives at short notice , and during periods of high fire risk . The railway is one of the most popular heritage railways in the country [ citation needed ] as well as being the sixth-longest standard gauge heritage line in the United Kingdom .

At that time , it was divided into the new British Railways ' Eastern Region , North Eastern Region , and partially the Scottish Region .",
  "/wiki/British_Railways_Mark_1": "British Railways Mark 1 is the family designation for the first standardised designs of railway carriages built by British Railways ( BR ) from 1951 until 1974 , now used only for charter services on the main lines or on preserved railways . Following nationalisation in 1948 , BR had continued to build carriages to the designs of the Big Four companies ( the Great Western , Southern , London Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern railways ) , and the Mark 1 was intended to be the standard carriage design for use across all lines , incorporating the best features of each of the former companies ' designs . It was also designed to be much stronger than previous designs , to provide better protection for passengers in the event of a collision or derailment . The Mark 1 coaches were built in two distinct tranches : the early vehicles ( 1951-1960 ) and the 'Commonwealth ' stock ( named from the type of bogie used ) from 1961 onwards ."
