  "/wiki/Grease_(musical)": "Grease is a 1971 musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey . Named after the 1950s United States working-class youth subculture known as greasers , the musical is set in 1959 at fictional Rydell High School ( based on William Howard Taft School in Chicago , Illinois ) and follows ten working-class teenagers as they navigate the complexities of peer pressure , politics , personal core values , and love . The score borrows heavily from the sounds of early rock and roll . In its original production in Chicago , Grease was a raunchy , raw , aggressive , vulgar show . Subsequent productions sanitized it and toned it down . The show mentions social issues such as teenage pregnancy , peer pressure and gang violence ; its themes include love , friendship , teenage rebellion , sexual exploration during adolescence , and , to some extent , class consciousness and class conflict . Jacobs described the show 's basic plot as a subversion of common tropes of 1950s cinema , since the female lead , who in many 1950s films transformed the alpha male into a more sensitive and sympathetic character , is instead drawn into the man 's influence and transforms into his fantasy . Grease was first performed in 1971 in the original Kingston Mines nightclub in Chicago ( since demolished ) . From there , it has been successful on both stage and screen , but the content has been diluted and its teenage characters have become less Chicago habitu\u00e9s ( the characters ' Polish-American backgrounds in particular are ignored with last names often changed , although two Italian-American characters are left identifiably ethnic ) and more generic . At the time that it closed in 1980 , Grease 's 3,388-performance run was the longest yet in Broadway history , although it was surpassed by A Chorus Line on September 29 , 1983 . It went on to become a West End hit , a successful feature film , two popular Broadway revivals in 1994 and 2007 , and a staple of regional theatre , summer stock , community theatre , and high school and middle school drama groups .

Based on Edmond Rostand 's classic 1897 play of the same name , it focuses on a love triangle involving the large-nosed poetic Cyrano de Bergerac , his beautiful cousin Roxana , and his classically handsome but inarticulate friend Christian de Neuvillette who , unaware of Cyrano 's unrequited passion for Roxana , imposes upon him to provide the romantic words he can use to woo her successfully in mid-17th century Paris .

Following a tryout in Boston 's Colonial Theatre and five previews , the Broadway production , directed and choreographed by Michael Kidd , opened on May 13 , 1973 at the Palace Theatre , where it ran for 49 performances .

  "/wiki/The_King_and_I": "The King and I is the fifth musical by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II . It is based on Margaret Landon 's novel , Anna and the King of Siam ( 1944 ) , which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens , governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s . The musical 's plot relates the experiences of Anna , a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King 's drive to modernize his country . The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece , as well as by a love to which neither can admit . The musical premiered on March 29 , 1951 , at Broadway 's St. James Theatre . It ran for nearly three years , making it the fourth longest-running Broadway musical in history at the time , and has had many tours and revivals . In 1950 , theatrical attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a part for her client , veteran leading lady Gertrude Lawrence . Holtzmann realized that Landon 's book would provide an ideal vehicle and contacted Rodgers and Hammerstein , who were initially reluctant but agreed to write the musical . The pair initially sought Rex Harrison to play the supporting part of the King , a role he had played in the 1946 film made from Landon 's book , but he was unavailable . They settled on the young actor and television director Yul Brynner . The musical was an immediate hit , winning Tony Awards for Best Musical , Best Actress ( for Lawrence ) and Best Featured Actor ( for Brynner ) . Lawrence died unexpectedly of cancer a year and a half after the opening , and the role of Anna was played by several actresses during the remainder of the Broadway run of 1,246 performances .",
  "/wiki/On_the_Twentieth_Century": "On the Twentieth Century is a musical with book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Cy Coleman . Based partly on the 1930s film and play of the same name , the musical is part operetta , part farce and part screwball comedy . The story involves the behind-the-scenes relationship between Lily , a temperamental actress and Oscar , a bankrupt theatre producer . On a luxury train traveling from Chicago to New York in the 1920s , Oscar tries to cajole the glamorous Hollywood star into playing the lead in his new , but not-yet-written drama , and perhaps to rekindle their romance . The musical ran on Broadway in 1978-1979 , running for 449 performances and winning five Tony Awards . It showcased Madeline Kahn in the role of Lily Garland , and when Kahn left the show , the role launched the career of Judy Kaye . Several revivals followed in London and elsewhere , and a 2015 Broadway revival featured Kristin Chenoweth and Peter Gallagher ."
