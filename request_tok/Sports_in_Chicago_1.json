  "/wiki/Rugby_union": "Rugby union , widely known simply as rugby , is a contact team sport that originated in England in the first half of the 19th century . One of the two codes of rugby football , it is based on running with the ball in hand . In its most common form , a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts at either end . Rugby union is a popular sport around the world , played by male and female players of all ages . In 2014 , there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide , of whom 2.36 million were registered players . World Rugby , previously called the International Rugby Football Board ( IRFB ) and the International Rugby Board ( IRB ) , has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886 , and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members . In 1845 , the first football laws were written by pupils at Rugby School ; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by Blackheath F.C . to leave the Football Association in 1863 and , in 1895 , the acrimonious split between the then amateur rugby union and the professional rugby league . Historically rugby union was an amateur sport , but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed , making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time . Rugby union spread from the Home Nations of Great Britain and Ireland and was embraced by many of the countries associated with the British Empire . Early exponents of the sport included Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and France . Countries that have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport include Fiji , Georgia , Madagascar , New Zealand , Samoa , and Tonga .",

The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting .

  "/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)": "Ultimate , also and originally known as ultimate frisbee , is a non-contact team sport played with a flying disc ( frisbee ) . Ultimate was developed in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in Maplewood , New Jersey . Although Ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements , it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating , even at the highest levels of competition . The term frisbee , often used to generically describe all flying discs , is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company , and thus the sport is not formally called Ultimate frisbee , though this name is still in common casual use . Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone . Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc , and interceptions , incomplete passes , and passes out of bounds are turnovers . Rain , wind , or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers , heightening the pressure of play . From its beginnings in the American counterculture of the late 1960s , ultimate has resisted empowering any referee with rule enforcement . Instead it relies on the sportsmanship of players and invokes Spirit of the Game to maintain fair play . Players call their own fouls , and dispute a foul only when they genuinely believe it did not occur . Playing without referees is the norm for league play but has been supplanted in club competition by the use of observers or game advisors to help in disputes , and the professional league employs empowered referees . In 2012 , there were 5.1 million Ultimate players in the United States .",

  "/wiki/Indoor_Soccer": "Indoor soccer or arena soccer ( known internationally as indoor football , minifootball , fast football , floorball or showball ) , is a game derived from association football adapted for play in a walled indoor arena . Indoor soccer , as it is most often known in the United States and Canada , was originally developed in these two countries as a way to play soccer during the winter months , when snow would make outdoor play difficult . In those countries , gymnasiums are adapted for indoor soccer play . In other countries the game is played in either indoor or outdoor arenas surrounded by walls , and is referred to by different names ( such as fast football ( futbol rapido ) in Mexico , showbol in South America , and indoor football ( futbol indoor ) in Spain ) . Indoor soccer has different regulations from other versions of association football designed for indoor play , such as futsal and five-a-side football . Unlike futsal , which is played on wooden or ceramic surfaces , indoor soccer is played on synthetic turf ( or , in the case of the British Masters Football variety , synthetic carpet ) . Indoor soccer courts are either delimited by walls or lines , and there are no player throw-ins . FIFA , the international body that oversees international association football competitions , does not sanction the synthetic turf version of indoor soccer , having developed its own code of indoor football ( which they refer to as futsal ) . Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States , Canada , and Mexico , with several amateur , collegiate and professional leagues functioning . While internationally less popular than futsal , indoor soccer is also played at the league level in many countries outside North America . The World Minifootball Federation ( WMF ) is the governing body of indoor soccer at the international level , having replaced the International Fast Football Federation ( FIFRA ) . The term minifootball , which was originally coined in Europe , has been adopted by the WMF as a standard international name for the sport .",

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports . The National Basketball Association ( NBA ) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity , salaries , talent , and level of competition . Outside North America , the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas .",
