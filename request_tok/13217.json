Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time . In 1936 , Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five inaugural members . At age seven , Ruth was sent to St. Mary 's Industrial School for Boys , a reformatory where he was mentored by Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Xaverian Brothers , the school 's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player . In 1914 , Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox . By 1916 , he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs , a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era . Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Red Sox , he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder . With regular playing time , he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 . After that season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy .

It was legal when his career began but prohibited in 1920 , with Coveleski being one of 17 pitchers permitted to continue throwing the pitch .
