  "intro": "The 1914 College Football All-America team is composed of college football players who were selected as All-Americans for the 1914 college football season. The only selectors for the 1914 season who have been recognized as official by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) are Walter Camp, whose selections were published in Collier's Weekly, and the International News Service (INS), a newswire founded by William Randolph Hearst. Although not recognized by the NCAA, many other sports writers, newspapers, and coaches selected All-America teams in 1914. They include Vanity Fair, Parke H. Davis, Walter Eckersall, The New York Globe, the New York Herald, the New York Evening Mail, the Atlanta Constitution, the Detroit Evening News, The Boston Post, and The Philadelphia Inquirer."
