  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers , letters or symbols . [ note 1 ] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position ; alternatively , a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector . A common choice of coordinates is latitude , longitude and elevation . To specify a location on a plane requires a map projection .",
  "/wiki/Annapolis_Royal_Generating_Station": "The Annapolis Royal Generating Station is a tidal power generating station in the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia , Canada . It is the only tidal generating station in North America and one of the few in the world . It is located upstream of Annapolis Royal , Nova Scotia in the Bay of Fundy . It generates about 30 million kilowatt hours per year , enough for 4500 houses . Peak output is 20 megawatts . A causeway on the Annapolis River creates a reservoir which powers a water turbine . Sluice gates in the causeway allow the reservoir to be refilled by the incoming tide , and retain the water in the reservoir when the tide recedes . Power is only generated when the tide is out , for about five hours , twice a day . Construction began in 1980 , and it opened in 1984 , it was constructed by Nova Scotia Power , at the time a provincial crown corporation . The decision to build the facility was partly prompted by the promise of federal funding for this alternative energy project , and the existence of a rock-filled causeway which had been built on the Annapolis River in 1960 by the Maritime Marshlands Reclamation Authority to block the Bay of Fundy tides from entering the river to replace the function of the existing dykes along the river banks . The causeway houses the power house and sluice gates . The blocking of water flow by the causeway has resulted in increased river bank erosion on both the upstream and downstream sides .",
  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .
