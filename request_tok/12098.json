  "/wiki/Rabbit_Fire": "Rabbit Fire is a 1951 Looney Tunes ( reissued as a 1960 Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies ) cartoon starring Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , and Elmer Fudd . Directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese , the short is the first film in Jones ' hunting trilogy - the other two films being Rabbit Seasoning and Duck ! Rabbit , Duck ! . It is also the first film to feature a feud between Bugs and Daffy . Produced by Edward Selzer for Warner Bros. Cartoons , Inc. , the short was released to theaters on May 19 , 1951 by Warner Bros. Pictures and is often considered among Jones ' best and most important films . The film marks a significant shift in Daffy 's personality , going from being the insane screwball character who ( like Bugs ) overwhelmed his adversaries , to being a much more flawed individual , full of greed and vanity and desiring for attention under the spotlight . This personality change , which was previously explored by Jones in You Were Never Duckier and Daffy Dilly , and even earlier in Friz Freleng 's You Ought to Be in Pictures , was done in order for Daffy to better serve as Bugs ' foil . This was fueled by Bugs ' popularity surpassing Daffy 's quickly over the years , increasing the desire of the studio 's animators to pair the two together . However , Daffy was returned to his original screwball personality in Who Framed Roger Rabbit , Looney Tunes : Back in Action ( which Daffy got both personalities ) , New Looney Tunes , and Looney Tunes Cartoons .",

Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age , making him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons , behind Bugs Bunny 's 167 appearances and Porky Pig 's 162 appearances . Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character . Directors such as Bob Clampett , Robert McKimson , and Chuck Jones are notable examples of the character .

  "/wiki/Elmer_Fudd": "Elmer J. Fudd is a fictional cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies series , and an adversary of Bugs Bunny . He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon ( second only to Bugs himself ) . His aim is to hunt Bugs , but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters . He speaks in an unusual way , replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws , so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a scwewy wabbit . Elmer 's signature catchphrase is , Shhh . Be vewy vewy quiet , I 'm hunting wabbits , as well as his trademark laughter . The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones ' work What 's Opera , Doc ? ( one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs , though he felt bad about it ) , the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville , and the Hunting Trilogy of Rabbit Season/Duck Season shorts ( Rabbit Fire , Rabbit Seasoning , and Duck !
