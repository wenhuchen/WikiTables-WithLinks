  "/wiki/Local_government_in_Wales": "Since 1 April 1996 , Wales has been divided into 22 single-tier principal areas for local government purposes . The elected councils of these areas are responsible for the provision of all local government services , including education , social work , environmental protection , and most highways . Below these there are also ( in most , but not all , parts of the principal areas ) elected community councils to which responsibility for specific aspects of the application of local policy may be devolved . The queen appoints a Lord Lieutenant to represent her in each of the eight preserved counties of Wales , which are combinations of principal areas retained for ceremonial purposes . Subdivisions of Wales created for such purposes as the organization of the National Health Service and the provision of police and emergency services are made up of combinations of principal areas . For example , the Dyfed-Powys Police force operates in the area covered by the principal areas of Pembrokeshire , Ceredigion , and Carmarthenshire as well as in Powys - the former three constituting the preserved county of Dyfed .",

  "/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid": "The Ordnance Survey National Grid reference system is a system of geographic grid references used in Great Britain , distinct from latitude and longitude . It is often called British National Grid ( BNG ) . The Ordnance Survey ( OS ) devised the national grid reference system , and it is heavily used in their survey data , and in maps based on those surveys , whether published by the Ordnance Survey or by commercial map producers . Grid references are also commonly quoted in other publications and data sources , such as guide books and government planning documents . A number of different systems exist that can provide grid references for locations within the British Isles : this article describes the system created solely for Great Britain and its outlying islands ( including the Isle of Man ) ; the Irish grid reference system was a similar system created by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland for the island of Ireland . The Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system ( UTM ) is used to provide grid references for worldwide locations , and this is the system commonly used for the Channel Islands and Ireland ( since 2001 ) . European-wide agencies also use UTM when mapping locations , or may use the Military Grid Reference System ( MGRS ) system , or variants of it . OSGB uses Orthorectified images of many temporal resolution for one area .",

During the second half of the first millennium Ceredigion was a minor kingdom . It has been administered as a county since 1282 . Welsh is spoken by more than half the population . Ceredigion is considered to be a centre of Welsh culture . The county is mainly rural with over 50 miles ( 80 km ) of coastline and a mountainous hinterland . The numerous sandy beaches and the long-distance Ceredigion Coast Path provide excellent views of Cardigan Bay . In the 18th and early 19th centuries , Cardiganshire had more industry than it does today ; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county ; lead , silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour . The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market . During the 20th century , livestock farming became less profitable , and the county 's population declined as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated . However , there has been a population increase caused by elderly people moving to the county for retirement , and various government initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income . Ceredigion 's population at the 2011 UK census was 75,900 .",

In the north of the county , the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century . The economy depends on agriculture , forestry , fishing and tourism . West Wales was identified in 2014 as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys with the decline in its industrial base , and the low profitability of the livestock sector .
