  "/wiki/Noh": "Noh ( \u80fd , N\u014d , derived from the Sino-Japanese word for skill or talent ) , is a major form of classical Japanese dance-drama that has been performed since the 14th century . Developed by Kan'ami and his son Zeami , it is the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed today . Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably , n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen . Traditionally , a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between ; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today . Optionally , an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation . Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story . Noh integrates masks , costumes and various props in a dance-based performance , requiring highly trained actors and musicians . Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts , women , children , and the elderly . Written in late middle Japanese , the text vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries . [ attribution needed ] Having a strong emphasis on tradition rather than innovation , Noh is extremely codified and regulated by the iemoto system .",
  "/wiki/\u014ctsuzumi": "The \u014ctsuzumi ( \u5927\u9f13 ) , also known as the \u014ckawa ( \u5927\u76ae ) , is an hourglass-shaped Japanese drum . It is a larger version of the tsuzumi , or kotsuzumi and is used in traditional Japanese theater and folk music . Its appearance is slightly different from that of the tsuzumi , and the sound produced is vastly different from any of the four sounds the kotsuzumi produces . Whereas the kotsuzumi is smaller and has a more ornate drum head , the \u014dkawa is larger , and its head takes on a more plain , leathery appearance . The sound is also higher and sharper in pitch , resembling more of a dry , almost metallic crack than the tsuzumi 's softer pon sound . The hourglass structure is slightly bigger , and has a prominent protruding knob at the middle , unlike that of the kotsuzumi , which has a smoothened-out middle section . The heads of the drum are taut very tightly , leaving no room for further tension , and acoustic , adjustments . The \u014dkawa is played on the left thigh of the player , possibly due to its larger , heavy size , whereas the tsuzumi is played upon the right shoulder . The drum heads are made of thick , stiff horsehide taken from grown horses , and care for the drum heads of the \u014dkawa is peculiar in that they must be kept dry at all times . In contrast , the heads of the smaller kotsuzumi must always be moist . Since the sound of the \u014dkawa is supposed to be higher in pitch , the player must ensure that the skin of the drum-heads remains as constricted as possible , and this is best realized when the drum heads are kept dry . To keep the drum heads dry , they are often heated near a kind of old style of Japanese furnace called a hibachi no less than an hour before the performance .",
  "/wiki/Taiko": "The origin of the instruments is unclear , though there have been many suggestions . Historical accounts , of which the earliest date from 588 CE , note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the kakko , a drum that originated in South China . This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko . Certain court music styles , especially gigaku and gagaku , arrived in Japan through both Korea and China . In both traditions , dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko . Certain percussive patterns and terminology in togaku , an early dance and music style in Japan , in addition to physical features of the kakko , also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance . Archaeological evidence shows that taiko were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE , during the latter part of the Kofun period , and were likely used for communication , in festivals , and in other rituals . This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of haniwa statues in the Sawa District of Gunma Prefecture . Two of these figures are depicted playing drums ; one of them , wearing skins , is equipped with a barrel-shaped drum hung from his shoulder and uses a stick to play the drum at hip height . This statue is titled Man Beating the Taiko and is considered the oldest evidence of taiko performance in Japan . Similarities between the playing style demonstrated by this haniwa and known music traditions in Korea and China further suggest influences from these regions . The Nihon Shoki , the second oldest book of Japanese classical history , contains a mythological story describing the origin of taiko .",
  "/wiki/Ky\u014dgen": "Ky\u014dgen ( \u72c2\u8a00 , mad words or wild speech ) is a form of traditional Japanese comic theater . It developed alongside Noh , was performed along with Noh as an intermission of sorts between Noh acts on the same stage , and retains close links to Noh in the modern day ; therefore , it is sometimes designated Noh-ky\u014dgen . Its contents are nevertheless not at all similar to the formal , symbolic , and solemn Noh theater ; ky\u014dgen is a comic form , and its primary goal is to make its audience laugh . Ky\u014dgen together with Noh is part of N\u014dgaku theatre . Ky\u014dgen is sometimes compared to the Italian comic form of commedia dell'arte , which developed around the same period ( 14th century ) and likewise features stock characters . It also has parallels with the Greek satyr play , a short , comical play performed between tragedies .",
  "/wiki/Hayashi_(music)": "A hayashi ( \u56c3\u5b50 ) is a group of performers who provide musical accompaniment for Japanese Noh or kabuki theatre , yose ( \u5bc4\u5e2d ) performances of rakugo , or a festival . In Noh , the hayashi sit along the rear of the stage , facing the audience and fully visible . A distinct and separate group of performers from the chorus , they are purely instrumentalists ; the type of instruments featured and the order in which they sit on stage follow established practices . The leftmost performer plays a small taiko , set on a stand before him , with two drumsticks . To his right is the \u014dtsuzumi hip drum , followed by the kotsuzumi shoulder drum , and the Noh flute ( n\u014dkan or simply fue ) . In kabuki , a number of shamisen players are added , along with , depending on the play , taiko drums of various sizes , various types of flutes , and other instruments , including a myriad of devices for sound effects . The kabuki hayashi is generally located in a small room just off-stage , and is not visible to the audience , though a barred window in the walls of the stage set indicates its location . For matsubame plays and dances , those based on works from Noh and ky\u014dgen , the hayashi will often be located along the rear of the stage , fully visible in imitation of Noh and ky\u014dgen modes . As with kabuki actors , and other performers in traditional arts , instrumentalists in the traditions of Noh hayashi , kabuki hayashi , and nagauta shamisen ( the shamisen style used in kabuki and bunraku ) , are members of a number of traditional lineages , following the iemoto system . Performers traditionally take on the name of their school as an art-name ( i.e . stage name ) . Notable hayashi lineages include the T\u014dsha school , Mochizuki school , and Tanaka school ."
