  "/wiki/Boston_Massacre": "The Boston Massacre , known to the British as the Incident on King Street , was a confrontation on March 5 , 1770 in which British soldiers shot and killed several people while being harassed by a mob in Boston . The event was heavily publicized by leading Patriots such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams . British troops had been stationed in the Province of Massachusetts Bay since 1768 in order to support crown-appointed officials and to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation . Amid tense relations between the civilians and the soldiers , a mob formed around a British sentry and verbally abused him . He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers , who were hit by clubs , stones , and snowballs . They fired into the crowd without orders , instantly killing three people and wounding others , two of whom later died of their wounds . The crowd eventually dispersed after Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson promised an inquiry , but they re-formed the next day , prompting withdrawal of the troops to Castle Island . Eight soldiers , one officer , and four civilians were arrested and charged with murder , and they were defended by future U.S. President John Adams . Six of the soldiers were acquitted ; the other two were convicted of manslaughter and given reduced sentences . The men found guilty of manslaughter were sentenced to branding on their hand . Depictions , reports , and propaganda about the event heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies , notably the colored engraving produced by Paul Revere ( shown at top-right ) .",

  "/wiki/Alfred_Denning,_Baron_Denning": "Alfred Thompson Tom Denning , Baron Denning , OM , PC , DL ( 23 January 1899 - 5 March 1999 ) was an English lawyer and judge . He was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1923 , and became a King 's Counsel in 1938 . Denning became a judge in 1944 with an appointment to the Probate , Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice , and transferred to the King 's Bench Division in 1945 . He was made a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1948 after less than five years in the High Court . He became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in 1957 and after five years in the House of Lords returned to the Court of Appeal as Master of the Rolls in 1962 , a position he held for twenty years . In retirement he wrote several books and continued to offer opinions on the state of the common law through his writing and his position in the House of Lords . Margaret Thatcher said that Denning was probably the greatest English judge of modern times . Mark Garnett and Richard Weight argue that he was a conservative Christian who remained popular with morally conservative Britons who were dismayed at the postwar rise in crime and who , like him , believed that the duties of the individual were being forgotten in the clamour for rights . He had a more punitive than redemptive view of criminal justice , as a result of which he was a vocal supporter of corporal and capital punishment . Though he changed his stance on capital punishment in later life . Denning was one of the most publicly known judges thanks to his report on the Profumo affair . He was noted for his bold judgments running counter to the law at the time .",
  "/wiki/Master_of_the_Rolls": "The Keeper or Master of the Rolls and Records of the Chancery of England , known as the Master of the Rolls , is the President of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales , Civil Division , and Head of Civil Justice . As a judge , he is the second in seniority in England and Wales only to the Lord Chief Justice . The position dates from at least 1286 , although it is believed that the office probably existed earlier than that . The Master of the Rolls was initially a clerk responsible for keeping the Rolls or records of the Court of Chancery , and was known as the Keeper of the Rolls of Chancery . The Keeper was the most senior of the dozen Chancery clerks , and as such occasionally acted as keeper of the Great Seal of the Realm . The post evolved into a judicial one as the Court of Chancery did ; the first reference to judicial duties dates from 1520 . With the Judicature Act 1873 , which merged the Court of Chancery with the other major courts , the Master of the Rolls joined the Chancery Division of the High Court and the Court of Appeal , but left the Chancery Division by the terms of the Judicature Act 1881 . The Master of the Rolls had also been warden of the little-used Domus Conversorum for housing Jewish converts , which led to the house and chapel being used to store legal documents and later becoming the location of the Public Record Office . He retained his clerical functions as the nominal head of the Public Record Office until the Public Records Act 1958 transferred responsibility for it to the Lord Chancellor . One residual reminder of this role is the fact that the Master of the Rolls of the day continues to serve , ex officio , as President of the British Records Association . The Master of the Rolls was also previously responsible for registering solicitors , the officers of the Senior Courts . One of the most prominent people to hold the position was Thomas Cromwell , a highly influential figure during the reign of Henry VIII ; more recently , Lord Denning held the position for 20 years , from 1962 to 1982 , and made sweeping changes in the common law .",

  "/wiki/Criminology": "Criminology ( from Latin cr\u012bmen , accusation originally derived from the Ancient Greek verb krino \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9 , and Ancient Greek -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 , -logy|-logia , from logos meaning : word , reason , or plan ) is the scientific study of the nature , extent , management , causes , control , consequences , and prevention of criminal behaviour , both on individual and social levels . Criminology is an interdisciplinary field in both the behavioural and social sciences , which draws primarily upon the research of sociologists , psychologists , philosophers , psychiatrists , biologists , social anthropologists , as well as scholars of law . The term criminology was coined in 1885 by Italian law professor Raffaele Garofalo as Criminologia [ it ] . Later , French anthropologist Paul Topinard used the analogous French term Criminologie [ fr ] . Paul Topinard 's major work appeared in 1879 . In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , the emphasis of criminology was on the reform of criminal law and not on the causes of crime . Scholars such as Beccaria and Bentham , were more concerned with the humanitarian aspects in dealing with criminals and reforming several criminal laws . Great progress in criminology was made after the first quarter of the twentieth century . The first American textbook on criminology was written in 1920 by sociologist Maurice Parmalee under the title Criminology . Programmes were developed for the specific purpose of training students to be criminologists , but the development was rather slow . From 1900 through to 2000 the study underwent three significant phases in the United States : ( 1 ) Golden Age of Research ( 1900-1930 ) -which has been described as a multiple-factor approach , ( 2 ) Golden Age of Theory ( 1930-1960 ) -which shows that there was no systematic way of connecting criminological research to theory , and ( 3 ) a 1960-2000 period-which was seen as a significant turning point for criminology . Criminologists are the people working and researching all of the ins and outs of criminology .",
