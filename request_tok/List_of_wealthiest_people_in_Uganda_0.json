  "/wiki/USD": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",

  "/wiki/Commercial_agriculture": "Intensive agriculture , also known as intensive farming ( as opposed to extensive farming ) and industrial agriculture , is a type of agriculture , both of crop plants and of animals , with higher levels of input and output per cubic unit of agricultural land area . It is characterized by a low fallow ratio , higher use of inputs such as capital and labour , and higher crop yields per unit land area . Most commercial agriculture is intensive in one or more ways . Forms that rely heavily on industrial methods are often called industrial agriculture , which is characterised by innovations designed to increase yield . Techniques include planting multiple crops per year , reducing the frequency of fallow years , and improving cultivars . It also involves increased use of fertilizers , plant growth regulators , and pesticides and mechanised agriculture , controlled by increased and more detailed analysis of growing conditions , including weather , soil , water , weeds , and pests . This system is supported by ongoing innovation in agricultural machinery and farming methods , genetic technology , techniques for achieving economies of scale , logistics , and data collection and analysis technology . Intensive farms are widespread in developed nations and increasingly prevalent worldwide . Most of the meat , dairy products , eggs , fruits , and vegetables available in supermarkets are produced by such farms . Some intensive farms can use sustainable methods , although this may necessitate higher inputs of labor or lower yields . Intensive animal farming involves large numbers of animals raised on limited land , for example by rotational grazing , or in the Western world sometimes as concentrated animal feeding operations . These methods increase the yields of food and fiber per acre as compared to extensive animal husbandry ; concentrated feed is brought to seldom-moved animals , or with rotational grazing the animals are repeatedly moved to fresh forage .",

Tertiary food processing has been criticized for promoting overnutrition and obesity , containing too much sugar and salt , too little fiber , and otherwise being unhealthful in respect to dietary needs of humans and farm animals .",

Many early shopping arcades such as the Burlington Arcade in London , the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan , and numerous arcades in Paris are famous and still trading . However , many smaller arcades have been demolished , replaced with large centers or malls , often accessible primarily by vehicle . Technical innovations such as electric lighting and escalators were introduced from the late 19th century . From the late 20th century , entertainment venues such as movie theaters and restaurants began to be added . As a single built structure , early shopping centers were often architecturally significant constructions , enabling wealthier patrons to buy goods in spaces protected from the weather .",

Since currencies are always traded in pairs , the foreign exchange market does not set a currency 's absolute value but rather determines its relative value by setting the market price of one currency if paid for with another . Ex : US $ 1 is worth X CAD , or CHF , or JPY , etc . The foreign exchange market works through financial institutions and operates on several levels . Behind the scenes , banks turn to a smaller number of financial firms known as dealers , who are involved in large quantities of foreign exchange trading . Most foreign exchange dealers are banks , so this behind-the-scenes market is sometimes called the interbank market ( although a few insurance companies and other kinds of financial firms are involved ) .

  "/wiki/Pharmaceuticals": "A medication ( also referred to as medicine , pharmaceutical drug , or simply drug ) is a drug used to diagnose , cure , treat , or prevent disease . Drug therapy ( pharmacotherapy ) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management . Drugs are classified in multiple ways . One of the key divisions is by level of control , which distinguishes prescription drugs ( those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the order of a physician , physician assistant , or qualified nurse ) from over-the-counter drugs ( those that consumers can order for themselves ) . Another key distinction is between traditional small-molecule drugs , usually derived from chemical synthesis , and biopharmaceuticals , which include recombinant proteins , vaccines , blood products used therapeutically ( such as IVIG ) , gene therapy , monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy ( for instance , stem-cell therapies ) . Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action , route of administration , biological system affected , or therapeutic effects . An elaborate and widely used classification system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System ( ATC system ) . The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines . Drug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies , academic scientists , and governments . As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization , partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines . Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed , how drugs are marketed , and in some jurisdictions , drug pricing . Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs .",

The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen . Cars became widely available in the early 20th century . One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T , an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company . Cars were rapidly adopted in the US , where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts , but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world . [ citation needed ] Cars have controls for driving , parking , passenger comfort , and a variety of lights . Over the decades , additional features and controls have been added to vehicles , making them progressively more complex , but also more reliable and easier to operate .

Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine , fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels .
