  "/wiki/Jack_Rabbit_(Kennywood)": "Jack Rabbit is a wooden roller coaster located at Kennywood Park near Pittsburgh in West Mifflin , Pennsylvania . Designed and built by John A. Miller and Harry C. Baker , Jack Rabbit opened in 1920 , making it is one of the oldest roller coasters in the world still in operation , and it 's tied with Jack Rabbit at Seabreeze Amusement Park for being the oldest in the United States . The ride 's three trains were manufactured by Edward Vettel , Sr. in 1951 and contain three cars of six seats each . The aging cars are considered a part of the ride 's nostalgic experience but also lead to some young children being disallowed to enter the ride ( 42 is the minimum ) , due to the use of a small lap bar to hold in riders . A popular early feature of the ride was a tunnel which covered the turnaround section after the first drop , but this was removed in 1947 when the new cars were ordered . In 1991 , the tunnel was restored , at a slightly shorter length . The Jack Rabbit was built shortly after Miller patented a new track design in 1920 ( which all wooden coasters built since have used ) . This design involved the use of wheels both under and over the track , which allowed Miller to create the then enormous 70-foot ( 21 m ) drop that is the attraction 's largest . It is most well known for its double dip element following the lift hill . The double dip produces strong airtime that makes the rider feel that they will be thrown from the seat , and a feeling that the train leaves the track ( it rises up but the upstop wheels keep it firmly on the rails ) . According to Rick Sebak , producer of Pittsburgh history programs for WQED , the layout and train design results in the rear seat of each train experiencing the greatest amount of airtime .",
