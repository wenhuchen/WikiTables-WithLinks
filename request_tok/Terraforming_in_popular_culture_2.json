  "/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis": "The Gaia hypothesis ( /\u02c8\u0261a\u026a.\u0259/ , /\u02c8\u0261e\u026a.\u0259/ , /\u02c8\u0261a\u026a\u02c8\u028c/ ) , also known as the Gaia theory or the Gaia principle , proposes that living organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings on Earth to form a synergistic and self-regulating , complex system that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for life on the planet . The hypothesis was formulated by the chemist James Lovelock and co-developed by the microbiologist Lynn Margulis in the 1970s . Lovelock named the idea after Gaia , the primordial goddess who personified the Earth in Greek mythology . In 2006 , the Geological Society of London awarded Lovelock the Wollaston Medal in part for his work on the Gaia hypothesis . Topics related to the hypothesis include how the biosphere and the evolution of organisms affect the stability of global temperature , salinity of seawater , atmospheric oxygen levels , the maintenance of a hydrosphere of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the habitability of Earth . The Gaia hypothesis was initially criticized for being teleological and against the principles of natural selection , but later refinements aligned the Gaia hypothesis with ideas from fields such as Earth system science , biogeochemistry and systems ecology . Lovelock also once described the geophysiology of the Earth . [ further explanation needed ] Even so , the Gaia hypothesis continues to attract criticism , and today some scientists consider it to be only weakly supported by , or at odds with , the available evidence .",
  "/wiki/Sun": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System . It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma , with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process . It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth . Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers ( 864,000 miles ) , or 109 times that of Earth , and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth . It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System . Roughly three quarters of the Sun 's mass consists of hydrogen ( ~73% ) ; the rest is mostly helium ( ~25% ) , with much smaller quantities of heavier elements , including oxygen , carbon , neon , and iron . The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star ( G2V ) based on its spectral class . As such , it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf ( its light is closer to white than yellow ) . It formed approximately 4.6 billion [ a ] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud . Most of this matter gathered in the center , whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System . The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core . It is thought that almost all stars form by this process .",

  "/wiki/Daisyworld": "Daisyworld , a computer simulation , is a hypothetical world orbiting a star whose radiant energy is slowly increasing or decreasing . It is meant to mimic important elements of the Earth-Sun system , and was introduced by James Lovelock and Andrew Watson in a paper published in 1983 to illustrate the plausibility of the Gaia hypothesis . In the original 1983 version , Daisyworld is seeded with two varieties of daisy as its only life forms : black daisies and white daisies . White petaled daisies reflect light , while black petaled daisies absorb light . The simulation tracks the two daisy populations and the surface temperature of Daisyworld as the sun 's rays grow more powerful . The surface temperature of Daisyworld remains almost constant over a broad range of solar output .",
  "/wiki/Spaceward_Ho!": "Spaceward Ho ! is a turn-based science fiction computer strategy game that was written by Peter Commons , designed by Joe Williams ( Joedelta ) and published by Delta Tao Software . The first version was released in 1990 , and further upgrades followed regularly ; the current version , 5.0.5 , was released on July 8 , 2003 . It has received wide recognition in the Macintosh community , for example being inducted into the Macworld Game Hall of Fame . Spaceward Ho ! can be categorized in the 4X game genre ( eXplore , eXpand , eXploit , eXterminate ) with a theme of galactic conquest . It took many elements of its design from the earlier Reach for the Stars , but expanded on many of that game 's basic themes while taking advantage of the larger memory and better graphics available on the Mac platform . Version 5 is available for iOS , Android , Classic Mac OS , and Mac OS X versions before 10.7 ( there is no universal binary ) and Palm OS . Version 4 is also available for Windows and version 2 for Amiga .",
  "/wiki/4X": "4X is a genre of strategy-based video and board games in which players control an empire and eXplore , eXpand , eXploit , and eXterminate . The term was coined by Alan Emrich in his September 1993 preview of Master of Orion for Computer Gaming World . Since then , others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and design . 4X computer games are noted for their deep , complex gameplay . Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development , as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy . Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of micromanagement needed to sustain an empire increases as the empire grows . 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons , and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement , with varying degrees of success . The earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from board games and 1970s text-based computer games . The first 4X computer games were turn-based , but real-time 4X games are not uncommon . Many 4X computer games were published in the mid-1990s , but were later outsold by other types of strategy games . Sid Meier 's Civilization is an important example from this formative era , and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre . In the new millennium , several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful .",
  "/wiki/Gravity": "Gravity ( from Latin gravitas , meaning 'weight ' ) , or gravitation , is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy - including planets , stars , galaxies , and even light - are brought toward ( or gravitate toward ) one another . On Earth , gravity gives weight to physical objects , and the Moon 's gravity causes the ocean tides . The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing , forming stars - and for the stars to group together into galaxies - so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe . Gravity has an infinite range , although its effects become increasingly weaker as objects get further away . Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity ( proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915 ) which describes gravity not as a force , but as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the uneven distribution of mass . The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole , from which nothing - not even light - can escape once past the black hole 's event horizon . However , for most applications , gravity is well approximated by Newton 's law of universal gravitation , which describes gravity as a force which causes any two bodies to be attracted to each other , with the force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them . Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions of physics , approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong interaction , 1036 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 1029 times weaker than the weak interaction . As a consequence , it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles . In contrast , it is the dominant interaction at the macroscopic scale , and is the cause of the formation , shape and trajectory ( orbit ) of astronomical bodies . The earliest instance of gravity in the Universe , possibly in the form of quantum gravity , supergravity or a gravitational singularity , along with ordinary space and time , developed during the Planck epoch ( up to 10\u221243 seconds after the birth of the Universe ) , possibly from a primeval state , such as a false vacuum , quantum vacuum or virtual particle , in a currently unknown manner . Attempts to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics , a quantum gravity theory , which would allow gravity to be united in a common mathematical framework ( a theory of everything ) with the other three fundamental interactions of physics , are a current area of research .",
  "/wiki/Temperature": "Temperature is a physical property of matter that quantitatively expresses hot and cold . Temperature is measured with a thermometer . Temperature is the manifestation of thermal energy , present in all matter , which is the source of the occurrence of heat , a flow of energy , when a body is in contact with another that is colder . Thermometers are calibrated in various temperature scales that historically have used various reference points and thermometric substances for definition . The most common scales are the Celsius scale ( formerly called centigrade ) , denoted \u00b0C , the Fahrenheit scale ( denoted \u00b0F ) , and the Kelvin scale ( denoted K ) , the latter of which is predominantly used for scientific purposes by conventions of the International System of Units ( SI ) . When a body has no macroscopic chemical reactions or flows of matter or energy , it is said to be in its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium . Its temperature is uniform in space and unchanging in time . The lowest theoretical temperature is absolute zero , at which no more thermal energy can be extracted from a body . Experimentally , it can only be approached very closely , but not reached , which is recognized in the third law of thermodynamics . Temperature is important in all fields of natural science , including physics , chemistry , Earth science , medicine , and biology , as well as most aspects of daily life .",

SimLife was re-released in 1993 as part of the SimClassics Volume 1 compilation alongside SimCity Classic and SimAnt for PC , Mac and Amiga .",
  "/wiki/Genetics": "Genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes , genetic variation , and heredity in organisms . Though heredity had been observed for millennia , Gregor Mendel , a scientist and Augustinian friar working in the 19th century , was the first to study genetics scientifically . Mendel studied trait inheritance , patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring . He observed that organisms ( pea plants ) inherit traits by way of discrete units of inheritance . This term , still used today , is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene . Trait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century , but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes . Gene structure and function , variation , and distribution are studied within the context of the cell , the organism ( e.g . dominance ) , and within the context of a population . Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields , including molecular genetics , epigenetics and population genetics . Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life ( archaea , bacteria , and eukarya ) . Genetic processes work in combination with an organism 's environment and experiences to influence development and behavior , often referred to as nature versus nurture . The intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off .",
  "/wiki/Evolution": "Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations . These characteristics are the expressions of genes that are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction . Different characteristics tend to exist within any given population as a result of mutation , genetic recombination and other sources of genetic variation . Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection ( including sexual selection ) and genetic drift act on this variation , resulting in certain characteristics becoming more common or rare within a population . It is this process of evolution that has given rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation , including the levels of species , individual organisms and molecules . The scientific theory of evolution by natural selection was conceived independently by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century and was set out in detail in Darwin 's book On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) . Evolution by natural selection was first demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are often produced than can possibly survive . This is followed by three observable facts about living organisms : ( 1 ) traits vary among individuals with respect to their morphology , physiology and behaviour ( phenotypic variation ) , ( 2 ) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction ( differential fitness ) and ( 3 ) traits can be passed from generation to generation ( heritability of fitness ) . Thus , in successive generations members of a population are more likely to be replaced by the progenies of parents with favourable characteristics that have enabled them to survive and reproduce in their respective environments . In the early 20th century , other competing ideas of evolution such as mutationism and orthogenesis were refuted as the modern synthesis reconciled Darwinian evolution with classical genetics , which established adaptive evolution as being caused by natural selection acting on Mendelian genetic variation . All life on Earth shares a last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) that lived approximately 3.5-3.8 billion years ago . The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite , to microbial mat fossils , to fossilised multicellular organisms .",
  "/wiki/Ecosystem": "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment , interacting as a system . These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows . Energy enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue . By feeding on plants and on one-another , animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system . They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present . By breaking down dead organic matter , decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes . Ecosystems are controlled by external and internal factors . External factors such as climate , parent material which forms the soil and topography , control the overall structure of an ecosystem but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem . Unlike external factors , internal factors are controlled , for example , decomposition , root competition , shading , disturbance , succession , and the types of species present . Ecosystems are dynamic entities - they are subject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some past disturbance . Ecosystems in similar environments that are located in different parts of the world can end up doing things very differently simply because they have different pools of species present . Internal factors not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them and are often subject to feedback loops .",

  "/wiki/Adventure_game": "In video game culture , an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle-solving . The genre 's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media , literature and film , encompassing a wide variety of literary genres . Many adventure games ( text and graphic ) are designed for a single player , since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult . Colossal Cave Adventure is identified [ by whom ? ] as the first such adventure game , first released in 1976 , while other notable adventure game series include Zork , King 's Quest , The Secret of Monkey Island , and Myst . Initial adventure games developed in the 1970s and early 1980s were text-based , using text parsers to translate the player 's input into commands . As personal computers became more powerful with better graphics , the graphic adventure-game format became popular , initially by augmenting player 's text commands with graphics , but soon moving towards point-and-click interfaces . Further computer advances led to adventure games with more immersive graphics using real-time or pre-rendered three-dimensional scenes or full-motion video taken from the first- or third-person perspective . For markets in the Western hemisphere , the genre 's popularity peaked during the late 1980s to mid-1990s when many [ quantify ] considered it to be among the most technically advanced genres , but it had become a niche genre in the early 2000s due to the popularity of first-person shooters , and it became difficult for developers to find publishers to support adventure-game ventures . Since then , a resurgence in the genre has occurred , spurred on by the success of independent video-game development , particularly from crowdfunding efforts , from the wide availability of digital distribution enabling episodic approaches , and from the proliferation of new gaming platforms , including portable consoles and mobile devices . The Walking Dead is considered [ by whom ? ] to be a key title which rejuvenated the genre .",

  "/wiki/Canal": "Canals are waterways channels , or artificial waterways , for water conveyance , or to service water transport vehicles . They may also help with irrigation . It can be thought of as an artificial version of a river . In most cases , the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create reservoirs of low speed current flow . These reservoirs are referred to as slack water levels , often just called levels . A canal is also known as a navigation when it parallels a river and shares part of its waters and drainage basin , and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its stretches of slack water levels while staying in its valley . In contrast , a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge , generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation .

  "/wiki/Real-time_strategy": "Real-time strategy ( RTS ) is a sub-genre of strategy video games in which the game does not progress incrementally in turns . This is distinguished from turn-based strategy ( TBS ) , in which all players take turns when playing . In an RTS , the participants position and maneuver units and structures under their control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents ' assets . In a typical RTS , it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game . This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources . These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose . More specifically , the typical game of the RTS genre features resource gathering , base building , in-game technological development and indirect control of units . The term real-time strategy was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s . The tasks a player must perform to succeed at an RTS can be very demanding , and complex user interfaces have evolved to cope with the challenge . Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments ; for example , the technique of clicking and dragging to select all units under a given area . Though some game genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template , recognized genres are generally not subsumed as RTS games . For instance , city-building games , construction and management simulations , and games of the real-time tactics variety are generally not considered to be real-time strategy .",

  "/wiki/Nanorobotics": "Nanorobotics is an emerging technology field creating machines or robots whose components are at or near the scale of a nanometer ( 10\u22129 meters ) . More specifically , nanorobotics ( as opposed to microrobotics ) refers to the nanotechnology engineering discipline of designing and building nanorobots , with devices ranging in size from 0.1-10 micrometres and constructed of nanoscale or molecular components . The terms nanobot , nanoid , nanite , nanomachine , or nanomite have also been used to describe such devices currently under research and development . Nanomachines are largely in the research and development phase , but some primitive molecular machines and nanomotors have been tested . An example is a sensor having a switch approximately 1.5 nanometers across , able to count specific molecules in a chemical sample . The first useful applications of nanomachines may be in nanomedicine . For example , biological machines could be used to identify and destroy cancer cells . Another potential application is the detection of toxic chemicals , and the measurement of their concentrations , in the environment . Rice University has demonstrated a single-molecule car developed by a chemical process and including Buckminsterfullerenes ( buckyballs ) for wheels . It is actuated by controlling the environmental temperature and by positioning a scanning tunneling microscope tip . Another definition [ whose ? ] is a robot that allows precise interactions with nanoscale objects , or can manipulate with nanoscale resolution .",

  "/wiki/Biome": "A biome /\u02c8ba\u026ao\u028am/ is a community of plants and animals that have common characteristics for the environment they exist in . They can be found over a range of continents . Biomes are distinct biological communities that have formed in response to a shared physical climate . Biome is a broader term than habitat ; any biome can comprise a variety of habitats . While a biome can cover large areas , a microbiome is a mix of organisms that coexist in a defined space on a much smaller scale . For example , the human microbiome is the collection of bacteria , viruses , and other microorganisms that are present on or in a human body . A 'biota ' is the total collection of organisms of a geographic region or a time period , from local geographic scales and instantaneous temporal scales all the way up to whole-planet and whole-timescale spatiotemporal scales . The biotas of the Earth make up the biosphere .",

  "/wiki/Spore_(2008_video_game)": "Spore is a 2008 life simulation real-time strategy God game developed by Maxis , published by Electronic Arts and designed by Will Wright , and was released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X . Covering many genres including action , real-time strategy , and role-playing games , Spore allows a player to control the development of a species from its beginnings as a microscopic organism , through development as an intelligent and social creature , to interstellar exploration as a spacefaring culture . It has drawn wide attention for its massive scope , and its use of open-ended gameplay and procedural generation . Throughout each stage , players are able to use various creators to produce content for their games . These are then automatically uploaded to the online Sporepedia and are accessible by other players for download . Spore was released after several delays to generally favorable reviews . Praise was given for the fact that the game allowed players to create customized creatures , vehicles and buildings . However , Spore was criticized for its gameplay which was seen as shallow by many reviewers ; GameSpot remarked : Individual gameplay elements are extremely simple . Controversy surrounded Spore due to the inclusion of SecuROM , and its digital rights management software , which can potentially open the user 's computer to security risks .",
  "/wiki/Sandbox_mode": "A video game with nonlinear gameplay presents players with challenges that can be completed in a number of different sequences . Each player may take on ( or even encounter ) only some of the challenges possible , and the same challenges may be played in a different order . Conversely , a video game with linear gameplay will confront a player with a fixed sequence of challenges : every player faces every challenge and has to overcome them in the same order . A nonlinear game will allow greater player freedom than a linear game . For example , a nonlinear game may permit multiple sequences to finish the game , a choice between paths to victory , different types of victory , or optional side-quests and subplots . Some games feature both linear and nonlinear elements , and some games offer a sandbox mode that allows players to explore an open world game environment independently from the game 's main objectives , if any objectives are provided at all . A game that is significantly nonlinear is sometimes described as being open-ended or a sandbox , though that term is used incorrectly in those cases , and is characterized by there being no right way of playing the game . Whether intentional or not , a common consequence of open-ended gameplay is emergent gameplay .",
