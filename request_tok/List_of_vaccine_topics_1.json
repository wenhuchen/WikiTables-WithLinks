  "/wiki/Bacillus_anthracis": "Bacillus anthracis is the etiologic agent of anthrax - a common disease of livestock and , occasionally , of humans - and the only obligate pathogen within the genus Bacillus . This disease can be classified as a zoonosis , causing infected animals to transmit the disease to humans . B. anthracis is a Gram-positive , endospore-forming , rod-shaped bacterium , with a width of 1.0-1.2 \u00b5m and a length of 3-5 \u00b5m . It can be grown in an ordinary nutrient medium under aerobic or anaerobic conditions .",
  "/wiki/Anthrax": "Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis . It can occur in four forms : skin , lungs , intestinal , and injection . Symptoms begin between one day and two months after the infection is contracted . The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center . The inhalation form presents with fever , chest pain , and shortness of breath . The intestinal form presents with diarrhea which may contain blood , abdominal pains , nausea , and vomiting . The injection form presents with fever and an abscess at the site of drug injection . Anthrax is spread by contact with the bacterium 's spores , which often appear in infectious animal products . Contact is by breathing , eating , or through an area of broken skin . It does not typically spread directly between people . Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products , travelers , postal workers , and military personnel . Diagnosis can be confirmed by finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site .",
  "/wiki/Anthrax_vaccines": "Vaccines against the livestock and human disease anthrax - caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis - have had a prominent place in the history of medicine , from Pasteurs pioneering 19th-century work with cattle ( the first effective bacterial vaccine and the second effective vaccine ever ) to the controversial late 20th century use of a modern product to protect American troops against the use of anthrax in biological warfare . Human anthrax vaccines were developed by the Soviet Union in the late 1930s and in the US and UK in the 1950s . The current vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) was formulated in the 1960s . Currently administered human anthrax vaccines include acellular ( USA , UK ) and live spore ( Russia ) varieties . All currently used anthrax vaccines show considerable local and general reactogenicity ( erythema , induration , soreness , fever ) and serious adverse reactions occur in about 1% of recipients . New third-generation vaccines being researched include recombinant live vaccines and recombinant sub-unit vaccines .",
  "/wiki/Bordetella_pertussis": "Bordetella pertussis is a Gram-negative , aerobic , pathogenic , encapsulated coccobacillus of the genus Bordetella , and the causative agent of pertussis or whooping cough . Like B. bronchiseptica , B. pertussis is motile and expresses a flagellum-like structure . Its virulence factors include pertussis toxin , adenylate cyclase toxin , filamentous h\u00e6magglutinin , pertactin , fimbria , and tracheal cytotoxin . The bacterium is spread by airborne droplets ; its incubation period is 7-10 days on average ( range 6-20 days ) . Humans are the only known reservoir for B. pertussis . The complete B. pertussis genome of 4,086,186 base pairs was published in 2003 . Compared to its closest relative B. bronchiseptica , the genome size is greatly reduced . This is mainly due to the adaptation to one host species ( human ) and the loss of capability of survival outside of a host body .",
  "/wiki/Whooping_cough": "Whooping cough , also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough , is a highly contagious bacterial disease . Initially , symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose , fever , and mild cough . This is followed by weeks of severe coughing fits . Following a fit of coughing , a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in . The coughing may last for 10 or more weeks , hence the phrase 100-day cough . A person may cough so hard that they vomit , break ribs , or become very tired from the effort . Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods where they do not breathe . The time between infection and the onset of symptoms is usually seven to ten days . Disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated , but symptoms are typically milder . Pertussis is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis . It is spread easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person . People are infectious from the start of symptoms until about three weeks into the coughing fits .",

  "/wiki/Epiglottitis": "Epiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis - the flap at the base of the tongue that keeps food from going into the trachea ( windpipe ) . Symptoms are usually rapid in onset and include trouble swallowing which can result in drooling , changes to the voice , fever , and an increased breathing rate . As the epiglottis is in the upper airway , swelling can interfere with breathing . People may lean forward in an effort to open the airway . As the condition worsens stridor and bluish skin may occur . Epiglottitis was historically mostly caused by infection by H. influenzae type b .

Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms , such as irritability , drowsiness , or poor feeding . If a rash is present , it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis ; for instance , meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may be accompanied by a characteristic rash . The inflammation may be caused by infection with viruses , bacteria , or other microorganisms , and less commonly by certain drugs . Meningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation 's proximity to the brain and spinal cord ; therefore , the condition is classified as a medical emergency . A lumbar puncture , in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , can diagnose or exclude meningitis . Some forms of meningitis are preventable by immunization with the meningococcal , mumps , pneumococcal , and Hib vaccines .

  "/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tb ) is a species of pathogenic bacteria in the family Mycobacteriaceae and the causative agent of tuberculosis . First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch , M. tuberculosis has an unusual , waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid . This coating makes the cells impervious to Gram staining , and as a result , M. tuberculosis can appear either Gram-negative or Gram-positive . Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl-Neelsen , or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used instead to identify M. tuberculosis with a microscope . The physiology of M. tuberculosis is highly aerobic and requires high levels of oxygen . Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system , it infects the lungs . The most frequently used diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test , acid-fast stain , culture , and polymerase chain reaction . The M. tuberculosis genome was sequenced in 1998 .",
  "/wiki/Tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis ( TB ) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) bacteria . Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body . Most infections do not have symptoms , in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis . About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which , if left untreated , kills about half of those affected . The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing mucus , fever , night sweats , and weight loss . It was historically called consumption due to the weight loss . Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms . Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough , spit , speak , or sneeze . People with latent TB do not spread the disease . Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke . Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays , as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids . Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test ( TST ) or blood tests .",

Additional doses are not supported by evidence . Serious side effects are rare . Often there is redness , swelling , and mild pain at the site of injection .",
  "/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis": "Neisseria meningitidis , often referred to as meningococcus , is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia , a life-threatening sepsis . The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round , and more specifically , diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs . About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx . As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults , causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases . It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically , mainly Africa and Asia . It occurs worldwide in both epidemic and endemic form . N. meningitidis is spread through saliva and respiratory secretions during coughing , sneezing , kissing , chewing on toys and even through sharing a source of fresh water . It has also been reported to be transmitted through oral sex and cause urethritis in men . It infects its host cells by sticking to them with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc and has several virulence factors .",
  "/wiki/Meningococcal_vaccine": "Meningococcal vaccine refers to any of the vaccines used to prevent infection by Neisseria meningitidis . Different versions are effective against some or all of the following types of meningococcus : A , B , C , W-135 , and Y . The vaccines are between 85 and 100% effective for at least two years . They result in a decrease in meningitis and sepsis among populations where they are widely used . They are given either by injection into a muscle or just under the skin . The World Health Organization recommends that countries with a moderate or high rate of disease or with frequent outbreaks should routinely vaccinate . In countries with a low risk of disease , they recommend that high risk groups should be immunized . In the African meningitis belt efforts to immunize all people between the ages of one and thirty with the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine are ongoing . In Canada and the United States the vaccines effective against all four types of meningococcus are recommended routinely for teenagers and others who are at high risk . Saudi Arabia requires vaccination with the quadrivalent vaccine for international travelers to Mecca for Hajj . Meningococcal vaccines are generally safe . Some people develop pain and redness at the injection site .",

  "/wiki/Typhoid_fever": "Typhoid fever , also known simply as typhoid , is a bacterial infection due to a specific type of Salmonella that causes symptoms . Symptoms may vary from mild to severe , and usually begin 6 to 30 days after exposure . Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days . This is commonly accompanied by weakness , abdominal pain , constipation , headaches , and mild vomiting . Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots . In severe cases , people may experience confusion . Without treatment , symptoms may last weeks or months . Diarrhea is uncommon . Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected ; however , they are still able to spread the disease to others . Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever , along with paratyphoid fever . The cause is the bacterium Salmonella enterica subsp . enterica serovar Typhi growing in the intestines and blood .",
  "/wiki/Typhoid_vaccine": "Typhoid vaccines are vaccines that prevent typhoid fever . Several types are widely available : typhoid conjugate vaccine ( TCV ) , Ty21a ( a live vaccine given by mouth ) and Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine ( ViPS ) ( an injectable subunit vaccine ) . They are about 30 to 70% effective for the first two years depending on the specific vaccine in question . The Vi-rEPA vaccine has been shown to be efficacious in children . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends vaccinating all children in areas where the disease is common . Otherwise they recommend vaccinating those at high risk . Vaccination campaigns can also be used to control outbreaks of disease . Depending on the vaccine , additional doses are recommended every three to seven years . In the United States the vaccine is only recommended in those at high risk such as travelers to areas of the world where the disease is common . The vaccines available as of 2018 are very safe . Minor side effects may occur at the site of injection . The injectable vaccine is safe in people with HIV/AIDS and the oral vaccine can be used as long as symptoms are not present .",

  "/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae": "Streptococcus pneumoniae , or pneumococcus , is a Gram-positive , alpha-hemolytic ( under aerobic conditions ) or beta-hemolytic ( under anaerobic conditions ) , facultative anaerobic member of the genus Streptococcus . They are usually found in pairs ( diplococci ) and do not form spores and are nonmotile . As a significant human pathogenic bacterium S. pneumoniae was recognized as a major cause of pneumonia in the late 19th century , and is the subject of many humoral immunity studies . S. pneumoniae resides asymptomatically in healthy carriers typically colonizing the respiratory tract , sinuses , and nasal cavity . However , in susceptible individuals with weaker immune systems , such as the elderly and young children , the bacterium may become pathogenic and spread to other locations to cause disease . It spreads by direct person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets and by autoinoculation in persons carrying the bacteria in their upper respiratory tracts . It can be a cause of neonatal infections . S. pneumoniae is the main cause of community acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly , and of sepsis in those infected with HIV . The organism also causes many types of pneumococcal infections other than pneumonia . These invasive pneumococcal diseases include bronchitis , rhinitis , acute sinusitis , otitis media , conjunctivitis , meningitis , sepsis , osteomyelitis , septic arthritis , endocarditis , peritonitis , pericarditis , cellulitis , and brain abscess . S. pneumoniae can be differentiated from the viridans streptococci , some of which are also alpha-hemolytic , using an optochin test , as S. pneumoniae is optochin-sensitive . S. pneumoniae can also be distinguished based on its sensitivity to lysis by bile , the so-called bile solubility test .",
