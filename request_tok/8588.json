  "/wiki/Binomial_name": "Binomial nomenclature ( two-term naming system ) , also called binominal nomenclature ( two-name naming system ) or binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts , both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages . Such a name is called a binomial name ( which may be shortened to just binomial ) , a binomen , binominal name or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name - the generic name - identifies the genus to which the species belongs , while the second part - the specific name or specific epithet - identifies the species within the genus . For example , humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . Tyrannosaurus rex is probably the most widely known binomial . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753 . But Gaspard Bauhin , in as early as 1622 , had introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici ( English , Illustrated exposition of plants ) many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus . The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules , of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICNafp ) . Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes , there are some differences , both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules . In modern usage , the first letter of the first part of the name , the genus , is always capitalized in writing , while that of the second part is not , even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place . Similarly , both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text ( or underlined in handwriting ) . Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox ( named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii .",
