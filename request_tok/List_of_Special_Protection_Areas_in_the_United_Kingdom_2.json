The community includes Bardsey Island ( Welsh : Ynys Enlli ) , the coastal area around Porthor , and the villages of Anelog , Llanfaelrhys , Penycaerau , Rhoshirwaun , Rhydlios , Uwchmynydd and Y Rhiw . Y Rhiw and Llanfaelrhys have long been linked by sharing rectors and by their close proximity , but were originally ecclesiastical parishes in themselves . The parish of Bodferin/Bodverin was assimilated in the 19th century . The village was the last rest stop for pilgrims heading to Bardsey Island ( Ynys Enlli ) , the legendary island of 20,000 saints . In the 18th and 19th centuries it developed as a shipbuilding centre and port . The mining and quarrying industries became major employers , and limestone , lead , jasper and manganese ( Mango ) were exported . There are the ruins of an old pier running out to sea at Porth Simdde , which is the local name for the west end of Aberdaron Beach . After the Second World War the mining industry collapsed , and Aberdaron gradually developed into a holiday resort . The beach was awarded a Seaside Award in 2008 . The coastal waters are part of Pen Ll\u0177n a ' r Sarnau Special Area of Conservation ( Welsh : Ardal Cadwraeth Arbennig Pen Ll\u0177n a ' r Sarnau ) , one of the largest marine designated sites in the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Bardsey_Island": "Bardsey Island ( Welsh : Ynys Enlli ) , known as the legendary Island of 20,000 Saints , is located 1.9 miles ( 3.1 km ) off the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in the Welsh county of Gwynedd . The Welsh name means The Island in the Currents , although its English name refers to the Island of the Bards , or possibly the island of the Viking chieftain , Barda . Bardsey is 0.6 miles ( 1.0 km ) wide , 1.0 mile ( 1.6 km ) long and 179 hectares ( 440 acres ; 0.69 sq mi ) in area . The north east rises steeply from the sea to a height of 548 feet ( 167 m ) at Mynydd Enlli , which is a Marilyn , while the western plain is low and relatively flat cultivated farmland . To the south the island narrows to an isthmus , connecting to a peninsula on which the lighthouse stands . Since 1974 it has been included in the community of Aberdaron . It is the fourth largest offshore island in Wales . The island has been an important religious site since Saint Cadfan built a monastery in 516 . [ failed verification ] In medieval times it was a major centre of pilgrimage and , by 1212 , belonged to the Augustinian Canons Regular . The monastery was dissolved and its buildings demolished by Henry VIII in 1537 , but the island remains an attraction for pilgrims to this day . Bardsey Island is now as famous for its wildlife and rugged scenery . A bird observatory was established in 1953 , largely due to the island 's position on important migration routes .",

The river has its source at an underground lake at the Black Mountain and emerges at the surface from Llygad Llwchwr which translates from the Welsh as eye of the Loughor . It flows past Ammanford and Hendy in Carmarthenshire and Pontarddulais in Swansea . The river divides Carmarthenshire from Swansea for much of its course and it separates Hendy from Pontarddulais at the point where the river becomes tidal . The Loughor meets the sea at its estuary near the town of Loughor where it separates the south coast of Carmarthenshire from the north coast of the Gower Peninsula . Among its tributaries is the River Amman , which joins the Loughor near Pantyffynnon . The area of the catchment is some 262 km2 ( 101 sq Miles ) . In the 18th century , the river was a noted salmon and sea trout river . Fish from the river was then carried on ponies to be sold at Swansea Market . The fishing declined in the 19th century due to increasing pollution from industrialisation .

There was further unrest in the early 15th century , when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glynd\u0175r , and during the English Civil War . Carmarthenshire is mainly an agricultural county , apart from the southeastern part which was once heavily industrialised with coal mining , steel-making and tin-plating . In the north of the county , the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century . The economy depends on agriculture , forestry , fishing and tourism . West Wales was identified in 2014 as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys with the decline in its industrial base , and the low profitability of the livestock sector .

The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market . During the 20th century , livestock farming became less profitable , and the county 's population declined as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated . However , there has been a population increase caused by elderly people moving to the county for retirement , and various government initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income .

At low tide the Lavan Sands make the narrowest part of the Menai Straits , at Beaumaris , a mere 237 m ( 778 ft ) . The area is designated as an SSSI due in part to the large numbers of Eurasian oystercatcher 's that migrate there due to the freshwater streams that flow across it . It is has been suggested by historians that the sands were the launch site of the Roman conquest of Anglesey attempt lead by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus in 60AD . What is certain is that they were used as a point of departure for the ferries between the mainland and the island until the Menai Suspension Bridge was completed in 1826 . Due to the busy shipping lanes in and out of Liverpool , the Sands and Dutchman 's Bank have been the location of several shipwrecks over the years involving vessels that have gone off course or have been looking for shelter from the Irish Sea .

The islands are important as a breeding site for seabirds , and they attract divers , who come to visit the numerous shipwrecks . The Skerries Lighthouse sits atop the highest point in the islands . The islands can be visited by charter boat from Holyhead . The individual islets are accessible from one another at low tide and by small bridges . The name Skerry is the Scottish diminutive of the Old Norse sker , and means a small rocky reef or island . The Welsh name for these islands , 'Ynysoedd y Moelrhoniaid ' , means Islands of the Seals . An alternative name provided by some English-language sources is 'St Daniel 's Isle ' .",
