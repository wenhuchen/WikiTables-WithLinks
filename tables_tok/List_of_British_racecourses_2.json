Where dates are not given for closure , it is possible they were still extant in the 20th century . No distinction has been made between enclosed courses of the type that are familiar now and those that were run over unenclosed courses , more akin to point-to-point racing . Indeed , some of these racecourses or parts of them are still used for that purpose .",
  "uid": "List_of_British_racecourses_2",
  "intro": "This List of British racecourses gives details of both current and former horse racing venues in Great Britain. There are, as of 2 February 2020, 59 racecourses operating in Great Britain (excluding Point-to-Point courses). In addition, there is a former racecourse, Folkestone, which is mothballed pending a decision over its future. There are currently no plans for Folkestone to operate fixtures although the basic racecourse infrastructure remains intact. Hereford racecourse reopened in October 2016 having been closed since 2012. Towcester racecourse is currently in administration and the future of racing at the venue is uncertain."
