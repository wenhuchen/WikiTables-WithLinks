  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",
  "/wiki/Solomon_Islands_campaign": "The Solomon Islands campaign was a major campaign of the Pacific War of World War II . The campaign began with Japanese landings and occupation of several areas in the British Solomon Islands and Bougainville , in the Territory of New Guinea , during the first six months of 1942 . The Japanese occupied these locations and began the construction of several naval and air bases with the goals of protecting the flank of the Japanese offensive in New Guinea , establishing a security barrier for the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain , and providing bases for interdicting supply lines between the Allied powers of the United States and Australia and New Zealand . The Allies , to defend their communication and supply lines in the South Pacific , supported a counteroffensive in New Guinea , isolated the Japanese base at Rabaul , and counterattacked the Japanese in the Solomons with landings on Guadalcanal ( see Guadalcanal Campaign ) and small neighboring islands on 7 August 1942 . These landings initiated a series of combined-arms battles between the two adversaries , beginning with the Guadalcanal landing and continuing with several battles in the central and northern Solomons , on and around New Georgia Island , and Bougainville Island . In a campaign of attrition fought on land , on sea , and in the air , the Allies wore the Japanese down , inflicting irreplaceable losses on Japanese military assets . The Allies retook some of the Solomon Islands ( although resistance continued until the end of the war ) , and they also isolated and neutralized some Japanese positions , which were then bypassed . The Solomon Islands campaign then converged with the New Guinea campaign .",

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion .
