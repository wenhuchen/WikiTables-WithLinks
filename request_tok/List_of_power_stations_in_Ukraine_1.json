Named after the nearby Pripyat River , the city was founded on February 4 , 1970 , as the ninth nuclear city ( a type of closed city ) in the Soviet Union , to serve the nearby Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant . It was officially proclaimed a city in 1979 and had grown to a population of 49,360 by the time it was evacuated on the afternoon of April 27 , 1986 , the day after the Chernobyl disaster . Although Pripyat is located within the administrative district of Ivankiv Raion , the abandoned municipality now has the status of city of oblast significance within the larger Kiev Oblast ( province ) and is administered directly from Kiev . Pripyat is also supervised by Ukraine 's Ministry of Emergencies , which manages activities for the entire Chernobyl Exclusion Zone .",
  "/wiki/RBMK": "The RBMK ( Russian : \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 , \u0420\u0411\u041c\u041a ; reaktor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalnyy , high-power channel-type reactor ) is a class of graphite-moderated nuclear power reactor designed and built by the Soviet Union . The name refers to its unusual design where , instead of a large steel pressure vessel surrounding the entire core , each fuel assembly is enclosed in an individual 8 cm diameter pipe ( called a channel ) which allows the flow of cooling water around the fuel . The RBMK is an early Generation II reactor and the oldest commercial reactor design still in wide operation . Certain aspects of the RBMK reactor design , such as the active removal of decay heat , the positive void coefficient properties , the 4.5 m ( 14 ft 9 in ) graphite displacer ends of the control rods and instability at low power levels , contributed to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster , in which an RBMK experienced a very large reactivity excursion , leading to a steam and hydrogen explosion , a large fire and subsequent meltdown . Radioactivity was released over a large portion of Europe . The disaster prompted worldwide calls for the reactors to be completely decommissioned ; however , there is still considerable reliance on RBMK facilities for power in Russia . Most of the flaws in the design of RBMK-1000 reactors were corrected after the Chernobyl accident and a dozen reactors have since been operating without any serious incidents for over twenty years . While nine RBMK blocks under construction were cancelled after the Chernobyl disaster , and the last of three remaining RBMK blocks at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in 2000 , as of 2019 there were still 10 RBMK reactors and three small EGP-6 graphite moderated light-water reactors operating in Russia , though all have been retrofitted with a number of safety updates . Only two RBMK blocks were started after 1986 : Ignalina-2 and Smolensk-3 . The only differences between RBMK-1000 and RBMK-1500 reactors are that the RBMK-1500 is cooled with less water ( thus more of the water turns into steam ) , and it uses less uranium . The only reactors of this type and power output are the ones at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant . The RBMKP-2400 is rectangular instead of cylindrical , and it was intended to be made in sections at a factory for assembly in situ .",
  "/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant": "The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant ( officially , the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant ) is a closed nuclear power plant near the abandoned city of Pripyat in northern Ukraine , 14.5 kilometers ( 9 mi ) northwest of the city of Chernobyl , 16 kilometers ( 10 mi ) from the Belarus-Ukraine border , and about 110 kilometers ( 68 mi ) north of Kiev . Reactor No . 4 was the site of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 , and the power plant is now within a large restricted area known as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone . Both the zone and the former power plant are administered by the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management . The three other reactors remained operational after the accident but were eventually shut down by 2000 , although the plant remains in the process of decommissioning as of 2020 . Nuclear clean-up is scheduled for completion in 2065 .",
  "/wiki/Chernobyl_accident": "The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986 , at the No . 4 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant , near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR . It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven - the maximum severity - on the International Nuclear Event Scale , the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan . The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor , which was commonly used throughout the Soviet Union . The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining cooling water circulation until the back-up generators could provide power - there is a time gap between the moment of power outage and the moment at which the back-up generators reach full power . This operating gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat . Three such tests had been conducted since 1982 , but they had failed to provide a solution . On this fourth attempt , the test was delayed by 10 hours , so an unprepared operating shift had to perform it . During a gradual decrease of reactor power that was done in preparation for the test , the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level at one moment . The operators were able to partially restore power , but this put the reactor in a highly unstable condition . The risks were not made evident in the operating instructions , despite a similar accident occurring years before , and the test proceeded even though the power was still lower than prescribed . Upon test completion , the operators triggered a reactor shutdown , but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead .",

The idea of a reactor was proposed at the Kurchatov Institute by Savely Moiseevich Feinberg . VVER were originally developed before the 1970s , and have been continually updated . As a result , the name VVER is associated with a wide variety of reactor designs spanning from generation I reactors to modern generation III+ designs . Power output ranges from 70 to 1300 MWe , with designs of up to 1700 MWe in development . The first prototype VVER-210 was built at the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant . VVER power stations have been mostly installed in Russia and the former Soviet Union , but also in China , Finland , Germany , Hungary , Slovakia , Bulgaria , India , and Iran . Countries that are planning to introduce VVER reactors include Bangladesh , Egypt , Jordan , and Turkey .",
