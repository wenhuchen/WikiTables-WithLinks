Each division winner advanced to the playoffs , expanded to four teams in this year . The Saints and the New York Giants agreed to switch divisions in 1968 and return to the 1967 alignment in 1969 . This was done to allow all Eastern Conference teams to visit New York at least once over the three-year period . The NFL season concluded on December 31 , when the Green Bay Packers defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the NFL Championship Game ( known as the Ice Bowl ) . Two weeks later , on January 14 , 1968 , the Packers handily defeated the AFL 's Oakland Raiders 33-14 in Super Bowl II at Miami 's Orange Bowl . This was Vince Lombardi 's final game as the Packers ' head coach . At the time , it was officially the AFL-NFL World Championship Game , though the more succinct Super Bowl was commonly used . The Baltimore Colts had tied for the NFL 's best record in 1967 at 11-1-2 , but were excluded from the postseason because of new rules introduced for breaking ties within a division . The L.A.

Born and raised in Temple , Texas , Greene attended North Texas State University ( now University of North Texas ) , where he earned consensus All-America honors as a senior playing for the North Texas State Mean Green football team . He was drafted by the Steelers fourth overall in the 1969 NFL Draft and made an immediate impact with the team , as he was named the NFL 's Defensive Rookie of the Year . Greene is credited with providing the foundation upon which Steelers coach Chuck Noll turned the dismal franchise into a sports dynasty . He was the centerpiece of the Steel Curtain defense that led Pittsburgh to four Super Bowl championships in a six-year span . Throughout his career , Greene was one of the most dominant defensive players in the NFL , able to overpower opposing offensive linemen with ease and disrupt blocking .

Greenwood , the first season for longtime Steelers public relations director Joe Gordon , and the team 's last season in Pitt Stadium before moving into then-state-of-the-art Three Rivers Stadium the following season . Although considered a turning point in the team 's history , the results were not immediate ; after winning the season opener against the Detroit Lions , the Steelers lost every game afterwards to finish 1-13 . The Steelers became the first team in NFL history since the 1936 Philadelphia Eagles to win its season opener and lose every remaining game , a feat not matched until 2001 when the Carolina Panthers won its season opener against Minnesota before losing every game en route to a 1-15 finish . The Steelers finished 1969 4th in the NFL Century Division and tied with the Chicago Bears for last in the NFL . With the Steelers finishing 1-6 at Pitt Stadium , it marked the last time the Steelers finished the season with a losing record at home until 1999 . As a result of their 1-13 records , Art Rooney of the Steelers won a coin toss with George Halas of the Bears to determine who would select Louisiana Tech quarterback Terry Bradshaw ( the consensus number 1 selection among league teams ) with the number one pick in the 1970 draft .

  "/wiki/Defensive_tackle": "A defensive tackle ( DT ) is typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players in American football . The defensive tackle typically lines up opposite one of the offensive guards . Depending on a team 's individual defensive scheme , a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles . These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent 's backfield . If a defensive tackle reads a pass play , his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback , or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm 's reach . Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme . In a traditional 4-3 defense , there is no nose tackle . Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle . Some teams , especially in the National Football League ( NFL ) , do have a nose tackle in this scheme , but most of them do not .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",
