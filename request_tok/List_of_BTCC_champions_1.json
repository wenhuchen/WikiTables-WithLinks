The Accord nameplate has been applied to a variety of vehicles worldwide , including coupes , station wagons , hatchbacks and a Honda Crosstour crossover . Since initiation , Honda has offered several different car body styles and versions of the Accord , and often vehicles marketed under the Accord nameplate concurrently in different regions differ quite substantially . It debuted in 1976 , as a compact hatchback , though this style only lasted through 1989 , as the lineup was expanded to include a sedan , coupe and wagon . By the sixth-generation Accord at the end of the 1990s , it evolved into an intermediate vehicle , with one basic platform but with different bodies and proportions to increase its competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets . For the eighth-generation Accord released for the North American market in 2007 , Honda had again chosen to move the model further upscale and increase its size . This pushed the Accord sedan from the upper limit of what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) defines as a mid-size car to just above the lower limit of a full-size car , with the coupe still rated as a mid-size car .
