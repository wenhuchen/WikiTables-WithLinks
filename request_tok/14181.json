Hugh Broom , the paterfamilias , occupied multiple prominent places in area society . As a religious leader , he was long the pastor of the Baptist church in Cambridge , and during the 1840s , he helped to found other churches in the surrounding countryside . As a farmer , he both tilled the soil and raised livestock , and by 1840 his estate was among the area 's largest , embracing 400 acres ( 160 ha ) in Cambridge Township and additional lands in surrounding townships . In 1858 , he was elected as one of Guernsey County 's two state representatives . He arranged for the construction of the present house in 1832 , and detail to parts of the stonework were far more attentive than what then and currently are found .

  "/wiki/Samuel_Harper_Stone_House": "The Samuel Harper Stone House is a historic residence in rural Guernsey County , Ohio , United States . A traditional building constructed in the 1840s by a well-known local builder , it has been named a historic site . The first resident of the house , Samuel Harper , was an ancestor of founding University of Chicago president William Rainey Harper , although the latter man was never associated with his forefather 's house . Construction was performed in 1841 by Norwich resident Archibald Boal , who gained the reputation of a master stonemason through his work on buildings such as the Harper House . Constructed of sandstone on a foundation of another kind of stone , the Harper House is typical of the once-common vernacular building form known as the I-house . The two-story interior is built around a central hallway on each floor , with rooms on either side . The fa\u00e7ade is a simple rectangle , with narrow sides rising to gables and a wider five-bay fa\u00e7ade . A chimney pierces the roofline at either end , while the fa\u00e7ade features openings in each bay of each story ; all are windows except the center of the first story , in which the main entrance is placed . The building is exceedingly simple , with virtually no ornamentation ; the sole exception is slight decoration above the main entrance on the lintel . Assorted farm-related outbuildings surround the house , which predates all of the outbuildings . In early 1980 , the Harper House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places , qualifying because of its historically significant architecture .

It was once home to one of the city 's political leaders , and later a Presbyterian minister . Few extant buildings in the city can compare to it architecturally , and it has been named a historic site . William McCracken settled in Cambridge in 1809 at the age of twenty-two . Although he began his residency as a simple blacksmith , McCracken later made himself into one of the most prominent members of local society . McCracken arranged for the construction of the present house , built in 1825 , but his wealth was sufficient to pay for the erection of a brick house in the same neighborhood in 1830 . Two years later , William McFarland was born in New Athens . At the age of twenty-five , he was ordained as a minister in one of the denominations that later formed the United Presbyterian Church of North America . McFarland moved to Cambridge in 1860 to pastor its United Presbyterian congregation , soon taking possession of the house , and it remained the property of the McFarland family until his daughter conveyed it to the Guernsey County Historical Society in 1966 . Since that time , the society has converted the house into its museum . Greek Revival in style , the McCracken-McFarland House is a weatherboarded structure with a slate roof .

Highways created in 1926 and its original termini were in San Francisco , California and Atlantic City , New Jersey . In the western United States , US 40 was functionally replaced by Interstate 80 ( I-80 ) , resulting in the route being truncated multiple times .

Starting at its western terminus in Utah , US 40 crosses a total of 12 states , including Colorado , Kansas , Missouri , Illinois , Indiana , Ohio , West Virginia , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Delaware , and New Jersey . US 40 passes through or by major cities including Denver , Kansas City , St. Louis , Indianapolis , Columbus , Baltimore , and Wilmington .

Possessed of a strong mind from young boyhood , Taylor was fondly remembered by his neighbors as a paragon of community virtue , :953 as well as for his unwavering editorial support of the war when so many men quavered or actively sought to subvert the national struggle . :955 Taylor 's house mixes two related architectural styles , the Queen Anne and the Stick-Eastlake . Built of wood on a stone foundation , the house is topped with a two-part roof : some is slate-covered , while the rest is protected by asphalt . The two-and-a-half-story facade is composed of three distinctive sections : the middle , comprising an elaborate porch with projecting eaves and a smaller sheltered pair of windows on the second story ; a plain right side ( as seen from the street ) with flat walls , a third-floor gable , and a simple window in each story ; and a three-story left side dominated by a large bay window on the first and second stories and a prominent overhang on the third . The entire building is covered with a multi-part gabled roof . In 2008 , the Taylor House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places , qualifying both because of its architecture and because of connection to Joseph Taylor . By that time , it had been converted into a bed and breakfast , the Colonel Taylor Inn ."
