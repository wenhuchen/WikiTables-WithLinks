  "/wiki/Golden_Gloves": "The Golden Gloves is the name given to annual competitions for amateur boxing in the United States , where a small pair of golden boxing gloves are awarded . The Golden Gloves is a term used to refer to the National Golden Gloves competition , but can also represent several other amateur tournaments , including regional golden gloves tournaments and other notable tournaments such as the Intercity Golden Gloves , the Chicago Golden Gloves , and the New York Golden Gloves . Arch Ward , sports editor of the Chicago Tribune came up with the idea of a citywide , Chicago amateur boxing tournament in 1923 , and gained sponsorship from the Tribune in 1927 where an annual tournament was held between Chicago and New York . In later years the idea was taken up by other cities , and a national tournament was held . Along with the New York Golden Gloves , the Chicago tournament was viewed as one of the two elite Golden Gloves Championships in the United States . Winners from selected states and regions headed to Chicago to meet in the Chicago Golden Gloves , while winners from other sections of the U.S. faced each other in the New York Golden Gloves tournaments . Champions from the Chicago tournament went on to face champions from the New York tournament in the Intercity Golden Gloves tournament , thus the Intercity Golden Gloves served as the National Tournament of Champions held in the Square Garden Chicago and Chicago Stadium . The Intercity Golden Gloves tournament ran from 1928 to 1961 , with the event being held at famed venues including the Chicago Coliseum . The National Golden Gloves contest began in 1962 and continues to be the most highly regarded amateur boxing tournament in the United States . It is sponsored and controlled by the Golden Gloves Association of America , Inc . Winners from 32 regional Golden Gloves competitions , coming up in regional teams of all weight classes , compete in the national competition , called the Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions . The Tournament of Champions is held once a year , and a new tournament site is selected annually .",
