  "/wiki/Polypropylene": "Polypropylene ( PP ) , also known as polypropene , is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications . It is produced via chain-growth polymerization from the monomer propylene . Polypropylene belongs to the group of polyolefins and is partially crystalline and non-polar . Its properties are similar to polyethylene , but it is slightly harder and more heat resistant . It is a white , mechanically rugged material and has a high chemical resistance . Polypropylene is the second-most widely produced commodity plastic ( after polyethylene ) and it is often used in packaging and labeling . In 2013 , the global market for polypropylene was about 55 million tonnes .",
  "/wiki/Plastic": "Plastic is material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds that are malleable and so can be molded into solid objects . Plasticity is the general property of all materials which can deform irreversibly without breaking but , in the class of moldable polymers , this occurs to such a degree that their actual name derives from this specific ability . Plastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass and often contain other substances . They are usually synthetic , most commonly derived from petrochemicals , however , an array of variants are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters . Due to their low cost , ease of manufacture , versatility , and imperviousness to water , plastics are used in a multitude of products of different scale , including paper clips and spacecraft . They have prevailed over traditional materials , such as wood , stone , horn and bone , leather , metal , glass , and ceramic , in some products previously left to natural materials . In developed economies , about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping , plumbing or vinyl siding . Other uses include automobiles ( up to 20% plastic ) , furniture , and toys . In the developing world , the applications of plastic may differ - 42% of India 's consumption is used in packaging . Worldwide , about 50 kg of plastic is produced annually per person , with production doubling every ten years . Plastics have many uses in the medical field as well , with the introduction of polymer implants and other medical devices derived at least partially from plastic . The field of plastic surgery is not named for use of plastic materials , but rather the meaning of the word plasticity , with regard to the reshaping of flesh .",

  "/wiki/Arthur_Compton": "Arthur Holly Compton ( September 10 , 1892 - March 15 , 1962 ) was an American physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his 1923 discovery of the Compton effect , which demonstrated the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation . It was a sensational discovery at the time : the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated , but the idea that light had both wave and particle properties was not easily accepted . He is also known for his leadership of the Manhattan Project 's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago , and served as Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis from 1945 to 1953 . In 1919 , Compton was awarded one of the first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad . He chose to go to the University of Cambridge 's Cavendish Laboratory in England , where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays . Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect . He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism , concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins , and studied cosmic rays , discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles . During World War II , Compton was a key figure in the Manhattan Project that developed the first nuclear weapons . His reports were important in launching the project . In 1942 , he became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory , with responsibility for producing nuclear reactors to convert uranium into plutonium , finding ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to design an atomic bomb . Compton oversaw Enrico Fermi 's creation of Chicago Pile-1 , the first nuclear reactor , which went critical on December 2 , 1942 . The Metallurgical Laboratory was also responsible for the design and operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge , Tennessee .",

  "/wiki/Manhattan_Project": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons . It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada . From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $ 2 billion ( about $ 23 billion in 2018 dollars ) . Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada . Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war : a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon . The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium , and therefore a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235 , an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium . Chemically identical to the most common isotope , uranium-238 , and with almost the same mass , it proved difficult to separate the two .",

Its three-astronaut crew - Frank Borman , James Lovell , and William Anders - were the first humans to fly to the Moon , to witness and photograph an Earthrise , and to escape the gravity of a celestial body . Apollo 8 launched on December 21 , 1968 , and was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the United States Apollo space program after Apollo 7 , which stayed in Earth orbit . Apollo 8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the Saturn V rocket , and was the first human spaceflight from the Kennedy Space Center , located adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida . Originally planned as the second crewed Apollo Lunar Module and command module test , to be flown in an elliptical medium Earth orbit in early 1969 , the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December , as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight . Astronaut Jim McDivitt 's crew , who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit , became the crew for the Apollo 9 mission , and Borman 's crew were moved to the Apollo 8 mission . This left Borman 's crew with two to three months ' less training and preparation time than originally planned , and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training . Apollo 8 took 68 hours ( almost three days ) to travel the distance to the Moon .

The craft was launched from Kennedy Space Center on April 11 , 1970 , but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the service module ( SM ) failed two days into the mission . The crew instead looped around the Moon , and returned safely to Earth on April 17 . The mission was commanded by Jim Lovell with Jack Swigert as command module ( CM ) pilot and Fred Haise as lunar module ( LM ) pilot . Swigert was a late replacement for Ken Mattingly , who was grounded after exposure to rubella . Accidental ignition of damaged wire insulation inside the oxygen tank as it was being routinely stirred caused an explosion that vented the tank 's contents . Without oxygen , needed both for breathing and for generating electric power , the SM 's propulsion and life support systems could not operate . The CM 's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry , forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat . With the lunar landing canceled , mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive . Although the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days , Mission Control in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days . The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power , a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of potable water . There was a critical need to adapt the CM 's cartridges for the carbon dioxide removal system to work in the LM ; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution .",

  "/wiki/Robert_Moog": "Robert Arthur Moog ( /\u02c8mo\u028a\u0261/ MOHG ; May 23 , 1934 - August 21 , 2005 ) was an American engineer and pioneer of electronic music . He was the founder of Moog Music and the inventor of the first commercial synthesizer , the Moog synthesizer , debuted in 1964 . This was followed in 1970 by a more portable model , the Minimoog , described as the most famous and influential synthesizer in history . Moog created fundamental synthesizer concepts such as the pitch wheel , modularity , envelope generation , and voltage control . He is credited for helping bring synthesizers to a wider audience and influencing the development of popular music . His only patent was on his filter design ; commentators have speculated that he would have become extremely wealthy had he patented his other innovations , but that their availablity in the public domain helped the synthesizer industry flourish . In 1971 , he sold Moog Music to Norlin Musical Instruments , where he remained as a designer until 1977 . In 1978 , he founded the company Big Briar , and in 2002 renamed it Moog Music after buying back the rights to the name . In his later years , Moog taught at the University of North Carolina at Asheville , and worked on designs for further instruments .",

  "/wiki/Moog_synthesizer": "The Moog synthesizer is a synthesizer developed by the American engineer Robert Moog . Moog debuted it in 1964 , and Moog 's company R.A. Moog Co. ( later known as Moog Music ) produced numerous models from 1965 to 1980 . It was the first commercial synthesizer , and is credited with creating the analog synthesizer as it is known today . By 1963 , Moog had been selling theremins of his own design for several years . Recognizing a demand for more practical and affordable electronic music equipment , he began developing the Moog synthesizer , guided by suggestions and requests from composers including Herb Deutsch , Richard Teitelbaum , Vladimir Ussachevsky , and Wendy Carlos . The Moog synthesizer consists of separate modules - such as oscillators , amplifiers , envelope generators , filters , noise generators , ring modulators , triggers and mixers - which create and shape sounds , and can be connected via patch cords . It can be played using controllers including keyboards , joysticks , pedals , and ribbon controllers . Its oscillators can produce waveforms of different timbres , which can be modulated and filtered to produce more combinations of sounds ( subtractive synthesis ) . Moog 's principal innovation was to use voltage to control pitch via a voltage-controlled oscillator . The synthesizer also introduced fundamental synthesizer concepts such as modularity and envelope generation . It was brought to the mainstream by Switched-On Bach ( 1968 ) , a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by Wendy Carlos . In the late 1960s , the Moog was adopted by rock and pop acts including the Doors , the Grateful Dead , the Rolling Stones , the Beatles .",

It sanctioned the PPG Indy Car World Series from 1979 until dissolving after the 2003 season . CART was founded in 1979 by United States Auto Club ( USAC ) Championship Division team owners who disagreed with the direction and leadership of USAC , with the then-novel idea of car owners sanctioning and promoting their own series collectively instead of relying on a neutral body to do so . Through the 1980s , the Indy Car World Series became the pre-eminent open-wheel auto racing series in North America , featuring street circuits , road courses , and oval track racing . CART drivers continued to compete at the USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 . Even as the series prospered , concerns about costs , competitiveness , and revenue sharing began to create opposition to CART 's organizational structure . Attempts at reform , which saw the company rebranded as IndyCar in 1992 and a compromise board formed , failed . In 1996 , an open wheel split saw the newly created Indy Racing League ( IRL ) take full control over the Indianapolis 500 and start a competing oval-based open-wheel series . CART ceased using the IndyCar name but continued its series without participating in the Indianapolis 500 . The split saw a dramatic fall in general interest for open wheel racing in the United States , which was compounded by the growing popularity of NASCAR , creating a downward trend in sponsorship and attendance at some tracks . After a series of setbacks in the early 2000s saw the departure of major racing teams and engine manufacturers to the IRL , CART went bankrupt at the end of the 2003 season . In 2004 , a trio of team owners acquired the assets of the series from bankruptcy , renaming the series Champ Car .",
