How Count Von Zarovich became the darklord of Barovia was detailed in the novel , I , Strahd : The Memoirs of a Vampire . As originally established in the Ravenloft : Realm of Terror boxed set known as the Black Box released in 1990 , The Ravenloft campaign setting was located in the Ethereal Plane . As a physical manifestation of that plane , lands , monsters and even people were created out of the mysterious mists , and the realm acted as a prison where one could enter or be transported , but means of escape were few . Other Ravenloft Domains and Darklords were eventually added in various AD & D 2nd edition ( and then later in 3rd edition ) products establishing a core continent attached around Barovia which could be traveled to by others if their respective lords allowed entering or leaving their borders ; while some Domains remained isolated in the mists and were referred to as Islands .",
