Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks . Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott , Daryl Johnston , and Lorenzo Neal .",

The Bengals were founded in 1966 as a member of the American Football League ( AFL ) by former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown , and began play in the 1968 season . Brown was the Bengals ' head coach from their inception to 1975 . After being dismissed as the Browns ' head coach by Art Modell ( who had purchased majority interest in the team in 1961 ) in January 1963 , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus . He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city , Hamilton County , and Major League Baseball 's Cincinnati Reds ( who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field ) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games . Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL , which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season , Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise . The Bengals , like the other former AFL teams , were assigned to the AFC following the merger . Cincinnati was also selected because , like their neighbors the Reds , they could draw from several large neighboring cities ( Louisville and Lexington , Kentucky ; Columbus , Dayton , and Springfield , Ohio ) that are all no more than 110 miles ( 180 km ) away from downtown Cincinnati , along with Indianapolis , until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season .

Sometimes the halfback can catch the ball from the backfield on short passing plays as he is an eligible receiver . Occasionally , they line up as additional wide receivers . When not running or catching the ball , the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking , either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",
