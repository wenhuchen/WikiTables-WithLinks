  "/wiki/Whyte_notation": "The Whyte notation for classifying steam and some internal combustion locomotives by wheel arrangement was devised by Frederick Methvan Whyte , and came into use in the early twentieth century following a December 1900 editorial in American Engineer and Railroad Journal . The notation counts the number of leading wheels , then the number of driving wheels , and finally the number of trailing wheels , numbers being separated by dashes . Other classification schemes , like UIC classification and the French , Turkish and Swiss systems for steam locomotives , count axles rather than wheels . In the notation a locomotive with two leading axles ( four wheels ) in front , then three driving axles ( six wheels ) and then one trailing axle ( two wheels ) is classified as 4-6-2 , and is commonly known as a Pacific .",
  "/wiki/0-6-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives , 0-6-0 represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels , six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels . This was the most common wheel arrangement used on both tender and tank locomotives in versions with both inside and outside cylinders . In the United Kingdom , the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod coupled driving wheels . Under the UIC classification , popular in Europe , this wheel arrangement is written as C if the wheels are coupled with rods or gears , or Co if they are independently driven , the latter usually being electric and diesel-electric locomotives .",

The railroad joined forces with the Norfolk and Western Railway ( N & W ) in 1982 to form the Norfolk Southern Corporation . The Norfolk Southern Corporation was created in response to the creation of the CSX Corporation ( its rail system was later transformed to CSX Transportation in 1986 ) . Southern and N & W continued as operating companies of Norfolk Southern until 1982 , when Norfolk Southern merged nearly all of N & W 's operations into Southern to form the Norfolk Southern Railway .

Knoxville is the principal city of the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area , which was 868,546 in 2015 . First settled in 1786 , Knoxville was the first capital of Tennessee . The city struggled with geographic isolation throughout the early 19th century . The arrival of the railroad in 1855 led to an economic boom . During the Civil War , the city was bitterly divided over the secession issue , and was occupied alternately by both Confederate and Union armies . Following the war , Knoxville grew rapidly as a major wholesaling and manufacturing center . The city 's economy stagnated after the 1920s as the manufacturing sector collapsed , the downtown area declined and city leaders became entrenched in highly partisan political fights . Hosting the 1982 World 's Fair helped reinvigorate the city , and revitalization initiatives by city leaders and private developers have had major successes in spurring growth in the city , especially the downtown area . Knoxville is the home of the flagship campus of the University of Tennessee , whose sports teams , the Tennessee Volunteers , are popular in the surrounding area . Knoxville is also home to the headquarters of the Tennessee Valley Authority , the Tennessee Supreme Court 's courthouse for East Tennessee , and the corporate headquarters of several national and regional companies .",

Other major events in the city 's history include the 1917 Speculator Mine disaster , the largest hard rock mining disaster in world history . Over the course of its history , Butte 's mining and smelting operations generated an excess of $ 48 billion worth of ore , but also resulted in numerous environmental implications for the city : The upper Clark Fork River , with headwaters at Butte , is the largest Superfund site in the United States , and the city is also home to the Berkeley Pit .

The majority of the abandoned and sold lines were lightly trafficked branches in Iowa , Illinois , Minnesota , South Dakota and Wisconsin .
