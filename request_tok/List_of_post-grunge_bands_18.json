It is the follow up to the band 's debut album Great Divide recorded at Seedy Underbelly Studio , Minneapolis , Minnesota . The album contains some of Semisonic 's best-known songs , including the major radio hit Closing Time , as well as the singles Singing In My Sleep and Secret Smile . The band had over 60 new songs in mind as they went into the recording process and had three specific requirements when they decided they wanted to record a new album . First , they did n't want to record any demotapes beyond simple guitar and vocal basement sketches , meaning the album versions would be the first band recordings of the songs . Second , they wanted no deadline for the finished masters . Third , the trio wanted to create tracks for the album in various hi- and lo-tech settings around Minneapolis , and use their computers to meld the different sounds together . Nick Launay was brought in to produce the album and the band recorded twenty songs over the course of four months . They pared those down to sixteen , mixed them , and used the best twelve for the finished record .",
  "/wiki/All_About_Chemistry": "All About Chemistry is the third and most recent studio album by American rock band Semisonic , released on March 13 , 2001 through MCA Records . With this release , the band failed , at least in America , to capitalize on the momentum it had generated with the song Closing Time from their previous album , Feeling Strangely Fine . This had a softer edge than Feeling Strangely Fine and was not as popular with the fans . Its poor sales led to the band going on an unofficial hiatus . [ citation needed ] However , it has a five star rating by Q Magazine . The track Chemistry was featured on the soundtrack for 40 Days and 40 Nights . The song One True Love was co-written by the band 's singer/guitarist , Dan Wilson and music legend Carole King . The song Get a Grip is an ode to masturbation . The title track was included on the album Nolee Mix which was released to promote the My Scene dolls . The special edition of the album features cover art with orange ( or pink in the UK ) fluid in the vials instead of the blue fluid of the original .
