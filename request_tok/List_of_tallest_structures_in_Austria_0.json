Vienna is Austria 's most populous city , with about 1.9 million inhabitants ( 2.6 million within the metropolitan area , nearly one third of the country 's population ) , and its cultural , economic , and political centre . It is the 6th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union . Until the beginning of the 20th century , it was the largest German-speaking city in the world , and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I , the city had 2 million inhabitants . Today , it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin . Vienna is host to many major international organizations , including the United Nations , OPEC , and the OSCE . The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of Czechia , Slovakia , and Hungary . These regions work together in a European Centrope border region . Along with nearby Bratislava , Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants . In 2001 , the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

  "/wiki/Skyscraper": "A skyscraper is a continuously habitable high-rise building that has over 40 floors and is taller than approximately 150 m ( 492 ft ) . Historically , the term first referred to buildings with 10 to 20 floors in the 1880s . The definition shifted with advancing construction technology during the 20th century . Skyscrapers may host offices , residential spaces , and retail spaces . For buildings above a height of 300 m ( 984 ft ) , the term supertall skyscrapers can be used , while skyscrapers reaching beyond 600 m ( 1,969 ft ) are classified as megatall skyscrapers . One common feature of skyscrapers is having a steel framework that supports curtain walls . These curtain walls either bear on the framework below or are suspended from the framework above , rather than resting on load-bearing walls of conventional construction . Some early skyscrapers have a steel frame that enables the construction of load-bearing walls taller than of those made of reinforced concrete . Modern skyscrapers ' walls are not load-bearing , and most skyscrapers are characterised by large surface areas of windows made possible by steel frames and curtain walls . However , skyscrapers can have curtain walls that mimic conventional walls with a small surface area of windows . Modern skyscrapers often have a tubular structure , and are designed to act like a hollow cylinder to resist wind , seismic , and other lateral loads . To appear more slender , allow less wind exposure and transmit more daylight to the ground , many skyscrapers have a design with setbacks , which in some cases is also structurally required .",

The power station was built as a replacement for the Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Station , a plant that was finished but due to a 1978 referendum never started up . The D\u00fcrnrohr plant was built in its proximity in order to use the already established power lines and other infrastructure . It consists of two blocks : the first with output of 405 MW operated by VERBUND Austrian Thermal Power AG and the second with output 352 MW operated by the Energie-Versorgung Nieder\u00f6sterreich AG . The plant was finished in 1987 . The plant was powered by black coal imported from the Czech Republic and Poland but today it burns any type of coal and can also use natural gas . In 2004 a heating plant ( largest such in Austria , at the time ) using the dissipated waste heat was opened . In 2009 the district heating pipeline from the power station to Sankt P\u00f6lten was erected from EVN W\u00e4rme . It is the longest district heating pipeline in Austria , with a length of 31 km .",

  "/wiki/Chimney": "A chimney is an architectural ventilation structure made of masonry , clay or metal that isolates hot toxic exhaust gases or smoke produced by a boiler , stove , furnace , incinerator or fireplace from human living areas . Chimneys are typically vertical , or as near as possible to vertical , to ensure that the gases flow smoothly , drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack , or chimney effect . The space inside a chimney is called the flue . Chimneys are adjacent to large industrial refineries , fossil fuel combustion facilities or part of buildings , steam locomotives and ships . In the United States , the term 'Smokestack industry ' refers to the environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels by industrial society including the electric industry during its earliest history . The term smokestack ( colloquially , stack ) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys , and the term funnel can also be used . The height of a chimney influences its ability to transfer flue gases to the external environment via stack effect . Additionally , the dispersion of pollutants at higher altitudes can reduce their impact on the immediate surroundings . The dispersion of pollutants over a greater area can reduce their concentrations and facilitate compliance with regulatory limits .",

  "/wiki/Bridge": "A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle , such as a body of water , valley , or road , without closing the way underneath . It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle , usually something that can be detrimental to cross otherwise . There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations . Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge , the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored , the material used to make it , and the funds available to build it . Most likely the earliest bridges were fallen trees and stepping stones , while Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland .
