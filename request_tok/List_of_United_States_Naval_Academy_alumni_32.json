Individuals are generally only removed from the list if the fugitive is captured , dies , or if the charges against them are dropped ; they are then replaced by a new entry selected by the FBI . In ten cases , the FBI removed individuals from the list after deciding that they were no longer a particularly dangerous menace to society .
