  "/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire": "Reading ( /\u02c8r\u025bd\u026a\u014b/ ( listen ) RED-ing ) is a large , historic university and minster town in Berkshire , South East England . It is in the Thames Valley at the confluence of the River Thames and River Kennet , and on both the Great Western Main Line railway and the M4 motorway . Reading is 70 miles ( 110 km ) east of Bristol , 24 miles ( 39 km ) south of Oxford , 40 miles ( 64 km ) west of London , 14 miles ( 23 km ) north of Basingstoke , 12 miles ( 19 km ) south-west of Maidenhead and 15 miles ( 24 km ) east of Newbury . The first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century . It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the medieval period , as the site of Reading Abbey , one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections , of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain . By 1525 , Reading was the largest town in Berkshire , and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth . The medieval town was seriously affected by the English Civil War , with a major siege and loss of trade , and played a pivotal role in the Revolution of 1688 , with that revolution 's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town . The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous . The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town 's brewing , baking and seed growing businesses . During that period , the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre . Today , [ when ? ] Reading is a major commercial centre , with involvement in information technology and insurance , and despite its proximity to London , has a net inward commuter flow .",

One of the home counties , Berkshire was recognised by the Queen as the Royal County of Berkshire in 1957 because of the presence of Windsor Castle , and letters patent were issued in 1974 . Berkshire is a county of historic origin , a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council . The county town is Reading . The River Thames formed the historic northern boundary , from Buscot in the west to Old Windsor in the east . The historic county therefore includes territory that is now administered by the Vale of White Horse and parts of South Oxfordshire in Oxfordshire , but excludes Caversham , Slough and five less populous settlements in the east of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead . All the changes mentioned , apart from the change to Caversham , took place in 1974 . The towns of Abingdon , Didcot , Faringdon , Wallingford and Wantage were transferred to Oxfordshire , the six places joining came from Buckinghamshire . Berkshire County Council was the main local government of most areas from 1889 to 1998 and was based in Reading , the county town which had its own County Borough administration ( 1888-1974 ) . Since 1998 , Berkshire has been governed by the six unitary authorities of Bracknell Forest , Reading , Slough , West Berkshire , Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham . The ceremonial county borders Oxfordshire ( to the north ) , Buckinghamshire ( to the north-east ) , Greater London ( to the east ) , Surrey ( to the south-east ) , Wiltshire ( to the west ) and Hampshire ( to the south ) .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144 .",
  "/wiki/Turret": "In architecture , a turret ( from Italian : torretta , little tower ; Latin : turris , tower ) is a small tower that projects vertically from the wall of a building such as a medieval castle . Turrets were used to provide a projecting defensive position allowing covering fire to the adjacent wall in the days of military fortification . As their military use faded , turrets were used for decorative purposes , as in the Scottish baronial style . A turret can have a circular top with crenelations as seen in the picture at right , a pointed roof , or other kind of apex . It might contain a staircase if it projects higher than the building ; however , a turret is not necessarily higher than the rest of the building ; in this case , it is typically part of a room , that can be simply walked into - see the turret of Chateau de Chaumont on the collection of turrets , which also illustrates a turret on a modern skyscraper . A building may have both towers and turrets ; turrets might be smaller or higher but turrets instead project from the edge of a building rather than continue to the ground . The size of a turret is therefore limited , since it puts additional stresses on the structure of the building . Turrets were traditionally supported by a corbel . In modern times , a gun turret is a weapon mount that houses the crew or mechanism of a projectile-firing weapon , allowing the weapon to be aimed and fired in some degree of azimuth and elevation . It can be found on warships , combat vehicles , military aircraft , and land fortifications , and usually offers some degree of armour or protection .",

At the United Kingdom Census 2011 , its population was 123,867 including 24,506 students . Cambridge became an important trading centre during the Roman and Viking ages , and there is archaeological evidence of settlement in the area as early as the Bronze Age . The first town charters were granted in the 12th century , although modern city status was not officially conferred until 1951 . The University of Cambridge was founded in 1209 . The buildings of the university include King 's College Chapel , Cavendish Laboratory , and the Cambridge University Library , one of the largest legal deposit libraries in the world . The city 's skyline is dominated by several college buildings , along with the spire of the Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church , and the chimney of Addenbrooke 's Hospital .

  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",

In architecture it is a decorative device , typically carved in stone , employed to emphasize the apex of a dome , spire , tower , roof , or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top , end , or corner of a building or structure . Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles . Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture . These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks . Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades , and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons . The charm at the end of a pull chain ( such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp ) is also known as a finial . During the various dynasties in China , a finial was worn on the top of the hats civil or military officials wore during formal court ceremonies . The finial was changed to a knob for other daily usage ( including semi-formal ceremonies ) . The Pickelhaube is a Central European military helmet with a finial topped by a spike .",

  "/wiki/Tudor_architecture": "The Tudor architectural style is the final development of Medieval architecture in England , during the Tudor period ( 1485-1603 ) and even beyond , and also the tentative introduction of Renaissance architecture to England . It is generally not used to refer to the whole period of the Tudor dynasty ( 1485-1603 ) , but to the style used in buildings of some prestige in the period roughly between 1500 and 1560 . It followed the Late Gothic Perpendicular style and was superseded by Elizabethan architecture from about 1560 in domestic building of any pretensions to fashion . In the much more slow-moving styles of vernacular architecture Tudor has become a designation for styles like half-timbering that characterize the few buildings surviving from before 1485 and others from the Stuart period . In this form the Tudor style long retained its hold on English taste . Nevertheless , 'Tudor style ' is an awkward style-designation , with its implied suggestions of continuity through the period of the Tudor dynasty and the misleading impression that there was a style break at the accession of James I in 1603 , first of the House of Stuart . The low Tudor arch was a defining feature . Some of the most remarkable oriel windows belong to this period . Mouldings are more spread out and the foliage becomes more naturalistic . During the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI , many Italian artists arrived in England ; their decorative features can be seen at Hampton Court Palace , Layer Marney Tower , Sutton Place , and elsewhere . However , in the following reign of Elizabeth I , the influence of Northern Mannerism , mainly derived from books , was greater . Courtiers and other wealthy Elizabethans competed to build prodigy houses that proclaimed their status .",
  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",

It lies within the United Kingdom 's second-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.9 million , and second-most populous metropolitan area , with a population of 3.3 million . It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs : Bolton , Bury , Oldham , Rochdale , Stockport , Tameside , Trafford , Wigan , and the cities of Manchester and Salford . Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , and designated a functional city region on 1 April 2011 . Greater Manchester spans 493 square miles ( 1,277 km2 ) , which roughly covers the territory of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area , the second most populous urban area in the UK . It is landlocked and borders Cheshire ( to the south-west and south ) , Derbyshire ( to the south-east ) , West Yorkshire ( to the north-east ) , Lancashire ( to the north ) and Merseyside ( to the west ) . There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry . It has a focused central business district , formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford , but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . Greater Manchester is governed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) , which consists of political leaders from each of the ten metropolitan borough councils , plus a directly elected mayor , with responsibility for economic development , regeneration and transport . Andy Burnham is the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester , elected in 2017 . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) effectively became unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county , with a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff .",

  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
