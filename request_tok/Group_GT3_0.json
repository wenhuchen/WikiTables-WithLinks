It has been owned by the Italian-American car giant FIAT Chrysler Automobiles ( FCA ) and FCA 's Italian predecessor FIAT S.p.A. since 1993 . Maserati was initially associated with Ferrari , which was also owned by FCA until being spun off in 2015 , but more recently it has become part of the sports car group including Alfa Romeo and Abarth ( see section below ) . In May 2014 , due to ambitious plans and product launches , Maserati sold a record of over 3,000 cars in one month . This caused them to increase production of the Quattroporte and Ghibli models .

Maserati has placed a production output cap at 75,000 vehicles globally .",
  "/wiki/Maserati_Coup\u00e9": "The Maserati Coup\u00e9 and Spyder ( Tipo M138 ) are a series of grand tourers produced by Italian automaker Maserati from 2001 to 2007 . The two nameplates refer to the four-seater coup\u00e9 and two-seater convertible models , respectively . The design of both models was based on the preceding 3200 GT , which was not sold in the US . Due to the confusing nature of the names Maserati Coup\u00e9 and Maserati Spyder ( which could refer to any coup\u00e9 or convertible Maserati has made ) the Coup\u00e9 and Spyder are both commonly referred to as the 4200 GT , which is an evolution of the prior model name and a reference to the increase in engine displacement from 3.2 L ( 3,217 cc ) to 4.2 L ( 4,244 cc ) . The Spyder was first unveiled to the public at the 2001 Frankfurt Auto Show with the Coup\u00e9 's debut following shortly thereafter at the 2002 Detroit Auto Show . Sales in the United States began in March 2002 for the Spyder and in May for the Coup\u00e9 . The introduction of the Spyder heralded Maserati 's return to the North American market after an 11-year hiatus . Almost as soon as it was introduced , the Spyder was selected by Forbes as the Best GT for 2001 . The Coup\u00e9 and Spyder were designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign , who also designed the Ghibli , mid-engined Bora , Quattroporte III and the 3200 GT as well . Interior design was commissioned to Enrico Fumia and was based heavily on the 3200 GT 's interior , restyled in 1999 . The cars were built at the Viale Ciro Menotti plant in Modena , Italy . In total , 13,423 cars were produced before being replaced by the GranTurismo .",
  "/wiki/Dodge": "Dodge is an American brand of automobile manufactured by FCA US LLC ( formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Group LLC ) , based in Auburn Hills , Michigan . Dodge vehicles currently include performance cars , though for much of its existence Dodge was Chrysler 's mid-priced brand above Plymouth . Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s , Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies for Detroit-based automakers and began building complete automobiles under the Dodge Brothers brand in 1914 , predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation . The factory was located in Hamtramck , Michigan , and was called the Dodge Main factory from 1910 until its closing in January 1980 . Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920 , and the company was sold by their families to Dillon , Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928 . Dodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s , though it made compact cars ( such as the 1963-76 Dart ) and midsize cars ( such as the B-Body Coronet and Charger from 1966-78 ) . The 1973 oil crisis and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the K platform of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year . The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler 's business in the 1980s ; one such derivative became the Dodge Caravan . The Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009 , including its short-lived merger with Daimler-Benz AG from 1998 to 2007 , its subsequent sale to Cerberus Capital Management , its 2009 bailout by the United States government , and its subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acquisition by Fiat . In 2011 , Dodge and its model sub-brands , Dodge Ram , and Dodge Viper were separated . Dodge said that the Viper would be an SRT product and Ram will be a standalone marque . In 2014 , SRT was merged back into Dodge .",

Production of the two-seat sports car began at New Mack Assembly Plant in 1991 and moved to Conner Avenue Assembly Plant in October 1995 . Although Chrysler considered ending production because of serious financial problems , on September 14 , 2010 , the then chief executive Sergio Marchionne announced and previewed a new model of the Viper for 2012 . In 2014 , the Viper was named number 10 on the Most American Cars list , meaning 75% or more of its parts are manufactured in the U.S .",
