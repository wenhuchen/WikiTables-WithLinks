  "/wiki/The_Best_of_Van_Morrison": "The Best of Van Morrison is a compilation album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison . It compiles songs spanning 25 years of his recording career . Released in 1990 by Polydor Records , the album was a critical and commercial success , becoming one of the best-selling records of the 1990s and helping revive Morrison 's mainstream popularity . Its success encouraged him to release a second and third greatest hits volume in 1993 and 2007 , respectively . The album remains Morrison 's best-seller .",
  "/wiki/Van_Morrison": "Sir George Ivan Van Morrison OBE ( born 31 August 1945 ) is a Northern Irish singer-songwriter , instrumentalist and record producer . His professional career began as a teenager in the late 1950s playing a variety of instruments including guitar , harmonica , keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands , covering the popular hits of that time . Van Morrison rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R & B band Them , with whom he recorded the garage band classic Gloria . His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single Brown Eyed Girl in 1967 . After Berns 's death , Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks ( 1968 ) . Though this album gradually garnered high praise , it was initially a poor seller . Morrison has a reputation for being at once stubborn , idiosyncratic , and sublime . His live performances at their best are seen as transcendental and inspired ; while some of his recordings , such as the studio albums Astral Weeks and Moondance , and the live album It 's Too Late to Stop Now , are highly acclaimed . Moondance ( 1970 ) established Morrison as a major artist , and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances . He continues to record and tour , producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received , sometimes collaborating with other artists , such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains . Much of Morrison 's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R & B , such as the popular singles Brown Eyed Girl , Jackie Wilson Said ( I 'm in Heaven When You Smile ) , Domino and Wild Night . An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy , loosely connected , spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition , jazz and stream-of-consciousness narrative , such as the album Astral Weeks and the lesser known Veedon Fleece and Common One .",
  "/wiki/Oklahoma!_(soundtrack)": "Oklahoma ! is the original soundtrack album of the 1955 film Oklahoma ! , an adaptation of the musical Broadway play of the same name . The soundtrack charted No . 1 on the Billboard Pop Album Chart in 1956 and has been in continual print . On July 8 , 1958 , it became the first album to be certified gold by the RIAA , and was later certified 2x multi-platinum on April 1 , 1992 . It was originally released as a 42-minute album on the Capitol Records label , but only in mono at first . However , as with the 1956 film soundtracks of Carousel and The King and I ( also issued by Capitol on LP ) , because the film 's soundtrack had been recorded in then state-of-the-art stereo , it was possible for Capitol to issue a stereo version of the album in 1958 . And again as with Carousel because of a difference between mono and stereo grooves , it was necessary to cut a very brief section of the music on the stereo release . The album is ranked number 985 in All-Time Top 1000 Albums ( 3rd . edition , 2000 ) . In 1956 , less than a year after the first mono Capitol soundtrack LP was released , Goddard Lieberson of rival Columbia Records produced a studio cast LP of Oklahoma ! featuring Nelson Eddy and a supporting cast , with the chorus and orchestra directed by Lehman Engel , and using the original orchestrations .",
  "/wiki/Californication_(album)": "Californication is the seventh studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers . It was released on June 8 , 1999 , on Warner Bros. Records and was produced by Rick Rubin . Californication marked the return of John Frusciante , who had previously appeared on Mother 's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik , to replace Dave Navarro as the band 's guitarist . Frusciante 's return was credited with changing the band 's sound altogether , producing a notable shift in style from the music recorded with Navarro . The album 's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band , but also contained more varied themes than previous outings , including death , contemplations of suicide , California , drugs , globalization , and travel . Californication is the Chili Peppers ' most commercially successful studio release internationally , with over 15 million copies sold worldwide , and more than 7 million in the United States alone . As of 2002 , the album had sold over 4 million copies in Europe . The record produced several hits for the band , including Otherside , Californication and the Grammy Award-winning Scar Tissue . Californication peaked at number three on the U.S . Billboard 200 . The record marked a significant change in style for the band : Rolling Stone 's Greg Tate noted that while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited , Californication dares to be spiritual and epiphanic . Another critic , Billboard 's Paul Verna , mentioned that the album brought out the group 's softer , melodic side , as opposed to their previous six albums .",
