  "/wiki/Chester-le-Street": "Chester-le-Street ( /\u02c8t\u0283\u025bst\u0259rlistri\u02d0t/ ) is a town in County Durham , England . Its history goes back to the building of a Roman fort called Concangis . This Roman fort is the Chester ( from the Latin castra ) of the town 's name ; the Street refers to the paved Roman road that ran north-south through the town , and which is now called Front Street . Chester-le-Street is located 7 miles ( 11 km ) south of Newcastle upon Tyne and 8 miles ( 13 km ) west of Sunderland on the River Wear . The parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert is where the body of St Cuthbert remained for 112 years before being transferred to Durham Cathedral , and the site of the first translation of the Gospels into English , Aldred writing the Old English gloss between the lines of the Lindisfarne Gospels there . A market town , the town holds markets Tuesdays , Fridays and Saturdays . From 1894 until 2009 the town had its own local government district . Originally from 1894 , this was the Chester-le-Street Rural District , which covered the town and several outlying villages . In 1909 the inner part of the Rural District was separated out to form the new Chester-le-Street Urban District Council , which covered the town as it was at that time . By 1974 , however , the town of Chester-le-Street had expanded far beyond the boundary of the Urban District and during that year 's Local Government reorganisation , the Urban District was amalgamated with parts of the remaining Rural District to form the new Chester-le-Street District . The Chester-le-Street District Council was abolished in 2009 when County Durham became a unitary authority as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England , a move that was controversial at the time .",
  "/wiki/Anchorite": "An anchorite or anchoret ( female : anchoress ; adj . anchoritic ; from Ancient Greek : \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 , anach\u014dr\u0113t\u1e17s , one who has retired from the world , from the verb \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 , anach\u014dr\u00e9\u014d , signifying to withdraw , to retire ) is someone who , for religious reasons , withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-oriented , ascetic , or Eucharist-focused life . Whilst anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of religious hermit , unlike hermits they were required to take a vow of stability of place , opting for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches . Also unlike hermits , anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite , following which they would be considered dead to the world , a type of living saint . Anchorites had a certain autonomy , as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority other than the bishop . The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of Christian monasticism . In the Catholic Church today , it is one of the Other Forms of Consecrated Life and governed by the same norms as the consecrated eremitic life . In England , the earliest recorded anchorites existed in the 11th century . Their highest number - around 200 anchorites - were recorded in the 13th century . From the 12th to the 16th centuries , female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male counterparts , sometimes by as many as four to one ( in the 13th century ) , dropping eventually to two to one ( in the 15th century ) . The gender of a high number of anchorites , however , is not recorded for these periods .",

It is located about 12 miles ( 19 km ) northwest of Darlington , 12 miles ( 19 km ) southwest of Durham and 5 miles ( 8 km ) southeast of Crook at the confluence of the River Wear with its tributary the River Gaunless . According to the 2001 census , Bishop Auckland has a population of 24,392 , increasing to 25,455 according to the 2016 estimate . Much of the town 's early history surrounds the Bishops of Durham and the establishment of a hunting lodge , which later became the main residence of the Bishops of Durham . This link with the Bishops of Durham is reflected in the first part of the town 's name . During the Industrial Revolution , the town grew rapidly as coal mining took hold as an important industry . The subsequent decline of the coal mining industry in the late twentieth century has been blamed for a fall in the town 's fortunes in other sectors . Today , the largest sector of employment in the town is manufacturing . Since 1 April 2009 , the town 's local government has come from the Durham County Council Unitary Authority . The unitary authority replaced the previous Wear Valley District Council and Durham County Council . Bishop Auckland is located in the Bishop Auckland parliamentary constituency . With its mining history , it used to be a safe Labour seat , but flipped for the Conservatives with a sizeable majority for the first time in 2019 after the area had decisively voted to leave the European Union three years prior .",

Cuthbert grew up in or around Lauderdale , near Old Melrose Abbey , a daughter-house of Lindisfarne , today in Scotland . He had decided to become a monk after seeing a vision on the night in 651 that St Aidan , the founder of Lindisfarne , died , but he seems to have seen some military service first . He was quickly made guest-master at the new monastery at Ripon , soon after 655 , but had to return with Eata of Hexham to Melrose when Wilfrid was given the monastery instead . About 662 he was made prior at Melrose , and around 665 went as prior to Lindisfarne . In 684 he was made bishop of Lindisfarne , but by late 686 he resigned and returned to his hermitage as he felt he was about to die , although he was probably only in his early 50s .",

His inspirational leadership , grasp of strategy , and unconventional tactics brought about a number of decisive British naval victories , particularly during the Napoleonic Wars . He was wounded in combat , losing sight in one eye in Corsica at the age of 36 , and most of one arm in the unsuccessful attempt to conquer Santa Cruz de Tenerife when he was 40 . He was fatally shot during his victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . Nelson was born into a moderately prosperous Norfolk family and joined the navy through the influence of his uncle , Maurice Suckling , a high-ranking naval officer . Nelson rose rapidly through the ranks and served with leading naval commanders of the period before obtaining his own command at the age of 20 in 1778 . He developed a reputation for personal valour and firm grasp of tactics , but suffered periods of illness and unemployment after the end of the American War of Independence . The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars allowed Nelson to return to service , where he was particularly active in the Mediterranean . He fought in several minor engagements off Toulon and was important in the capture of Corsica and subsequent diplomatic duties with the Italian states . In 1797 , he distinguished himself while in command of HMS Captain at the Battle of Cape St Vincent . Shortly after that battle , Nelson took part in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife , where the attack was defeated and he was badly wounded , losing his right arm , and was forced to return to England to recuperate .

He was Emperor of the French as Napoleon I from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days . Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars . He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles , building a large empire that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815 . He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history , and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide . Napoleon 's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history . He was born Napoleone Buonaparte ( Italian : [ napole\u02c8o\u02d0ne \u02ccbw\u0254na\u02c8parte ] ) in Corsica to a relatively modest Italian family from minor nobility . He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789 . He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military , seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24 . The French Directory eventually gave him command of the Army of Italy after he suppressed the 13 Vend\u00e9miaire revolt against the government from royalist insurgents . At age 26 , he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs - winning virtually every battle , conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing sister republics with local support , and becoming a war hero in France . In 1798 , he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power .",

As part of an overall French plan to combine all French and allied fleets to take control of the English Channel and enable Napoleon 's Grande Arm\u00e9e to invade England , French and Spanish fleets under French Admiral Villeneuve sailed from the port of C\u00e1diz in the south of Spain on 18 October 1805 . They encountered the British fleet under Admiral Lord Nelson , recently assembled to meet this threat , in the Atlantic Ocean along the southwest coast of Spain , off Cape Trafalgar , near the town of Los Ca\u00f1os de Meca . Villeneuve was uncertain about engaging , and the Franco-Spanish fleet failed to fully organize . In contrast , Nelson was decisive , organizing the British fleet into two columns sailing straight into the enemy to pierce its wavering lines . In a fierce battle , 27 British ships of the line fought 33 French and Spanish ships of the line . Although the lead ships of the British columns were heavily battered , with Nelsons flagship HMS Victory nearly disabled , the greater experience and training of the Royal Navy overcame the greater numbers of the French and Spanish navies . The Franco-Spanish fleet lost 22 ships ; the British lost none . During the battle , Nelson was shot by a French musketeer , and he died shortly before the battle ended . Villeneuve was captured along with his flagship Bucentaure . He later attended Nelson 's funeral while a captive on parole in Britain . Admiral Federico Gravina , the senior Spanish flag officer , escaped with the remnant of the fleet .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",
