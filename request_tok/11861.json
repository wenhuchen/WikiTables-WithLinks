Montreal was awarded the rights to the 1976 Games on May 12 , 1970 , at the 69th IOC Session in Amsterdam , over the bids of Moscow and Los Angeles . It was the first and , so far , only Summer Olympic Games to be held in Canada . Calgary and Vancouver later hosted the Winter Olympic Games in 1988 and 2010 , respectively . Twenty-nine countries , mostly African , boycotted the Montreal Games when the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) refused to ban New Zealand , after the New Zealand national rugby union team had toured South Africa earlier in 1976 in defiance of the United Nations ' calls for a sporting embargo . The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals .",

  "/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics": "The 1972 Summer Olympics ( German : Olympische Sommerspiele 1972 ) , officially known as the Games of the XX Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event held in Munich , West Germany , from 26 August to 11 September 1972 . The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the Munich massacre in the second week , in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by Black September terrorists . The 1972 Summer Olympics were the second Summer Olympics to be held in Germany , after the 1936 Games in Berlin , which had taken place under the Nazi regime . The West German Government had been eager to have the Munich Olympics present a democratic and optimistic Germany to the world , as shown by the Games ' official motto , Die Heiteren Spiele , or the cheerful Games . The logo of the Games was a blue solar logo ( the Bright Sun ) by Otl Aicher , the designer and director of the visual conception commission . The Olympic mascot , the dachshund Waldi , was the first officially named Olympic mascot . The Olympic Fanfare was composed by Herbert Rehbein . The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals . The Olympic Park ( Olympiapark ) is based on Frei Otto 's plans and after the Games became a Munich landmark . The competition sites , designed by architect G\u00fcnther Behnisch , included the Olympic swimming hall , the Olympics Hall ( Olympiahalle , a multipurpose facility ) and the Olympic Stadium ( Olympiastadion ) , and an Olympic village very close to the park . The design of the stadium was considered revolutionary , with sweeping canopies of acrylic glass stabilized by metal ropes , used on such a large scale for the first time .",
