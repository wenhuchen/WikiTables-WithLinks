The drama jury , which consists of one academic and four critics , attends plays in New York and in regional theaters . The Pulitzer board has the authority to overrule the jury 's choice , however , as happened in 1986 when the jury chose the CIVIL warS to receive the prize , but due to the board 's opposition no award was given .
