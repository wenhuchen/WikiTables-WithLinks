The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

However , there are often differences in how each nation ( or service in each nation ) employs corporals . Some militaries do n't have corporals , but may instead have a Junior Sergeant . In some militaries , the rank of corporal nominally corresponds to commanding a section or squad of soldiers . However , in the United States Army , the rank of corporal is considered a lateral promotion from E-4 Specialist and usually only occurs when the soldier has been selected by a promotion board to become an E-5 Sergeant and is serving in an E-5 billet such as a fireteam leader in a rifle squad . The lateral promotion is used to make the soldier a non-commissioned officer without changing the soldier 's pay . As the Table of Organization & Equipment ( TO & E ) rank of a fire team leader is sergeant and that of squad leader is staff sergeant . In the United States Marine Corps , corporal is the Table of Organization ( TO ) rank for a rifle fire team leader , machine gun team leader , light mortar squad leader , and assault weapon squad leader , as well as gunner on most larger crew served weapons ( i.e . medium mortars , heavy machine guns , and anti-tank missiles ) , armored vehicles ( e.g . tanks , light armored vehicles , and armored assault vehicles ) , and the two assistant gunners on a howitzer ( the gunner is a sergeant ) .

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) .

  "/wiki/Ordinary_Seaman": "An ordinary seaman ( OS ) is a naval rating of the deck department of a ship . The position is an apprenticeship to become an able seaman , and has been for centuries . In modern times , an OS is required to work on a ship for a specific amount of time , gaining what is referred to as sea time . For centuries , the term ordinary seaman was used to refer to a seaman with between one and two years ' experience at sea , who showed enough seamanship to be so rated by their captain . Historically in some navies and the merchant marine a sailor with less experience was called a landsman . An OS is generally not required to stand watch , but must pass examinations on watchstanding skills such as performing lookout duty and being a helmsman . Thus an OS will often be found on a ship 's bridge after working hours taking a turn at the ship 's wheel or being familiarized with bridge equipment . During the apprenticeship , an OS performs a variety of duties concerned with the operation and upkeep of deck department areas and equipment . These duties vary with the type of ship , the type of voyage , the number of crewmembers , the weather , the supervisor , and any number of other variables . However , in most cases , one can expect an ordinary seaman to clean , to perform maintenance , to work with deck equipment , and to undergo on-the-job-training under the supervision of senior deck department members .",

The alternative spelling , serjeant , is used in The Rifles and other units that draw their heritage from the British Light Infantry . Its origin is the Latin serviens , 'one who serves ' , through the French term sergent .

In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major . Many countries use sergeant rank , whether in English or using a cognate with the same origin in another language .

  "/wiki/Petersburg,_Virginia": "Petersburg is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States . As of the 2010 census , the population was 32,420 . The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines Petersburg ( along with the city of Colonial Heights ) with Dinwiddie County for statistical purposes . It is located on the Appomattox River ( a tributary of the longer larger James River flowing east to meet the southern mouth of the Chesapeake Bay at the Hampton Roads harbor and the Atlantic Ocean ) . The city is just 21 miles ( 34 km ) south of the historic commonwealth ( state ) capital city of Richmond . The city 's unique industrial past and its location as a transportation hub combined to create wealth for Virginia and the Middle Atlantic and Upper South regions of the nation . Early in the colonial era of the 18th century , Petersburg was the final destination on the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System because of its location on the Appomattox River with its connection to the James River to the east at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line ( the head of navigation of rivers on the U.S. East Coast ) and the tying in with the James River shipping traffic was a strategic place for transportation and commercial activities . It connected commerce as far inland as Farmville , Virginia at the foothills of the Blue Ridge and the Appalachian Mountains chain , to shipping further east into the Chesapeake Bay and North Atlantic Ocean . For similar reasons , 17th century era Fort Henry was built at the order of the Virginia House of Burgesses at Petersburg in 1645 to protect the river traffic . As railroads were being constructed and extended in the state in the 1830s and 1840s , Petersburg was developed as a major transfer point for both north-south and east-west competitors . The Petersburg Railroad , authorized in 1830 , three years after the first American railway , the B. & O. in Baltimore , by the state legislatures of both Virginia and North Carolina to the south , which opened in 1833 . It was another one of the earliest predecessors of the modern-day CSX Transportation system ."
