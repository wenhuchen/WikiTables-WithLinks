  "/wiki/John_Blackwell_(Alun)": "John Blackwell ( 1797 - 19 May 1840 ) , who used the bardic name Alun , was a Welsh language poet .",
  "/wiki/Bardic_name": "A bardic name ( Welsh : enw barddol , Cornish : hanow bardhek ) is a pseudonym used in Wales , Cornwall , or Brittany by poets and other artists , especially those involved in the eisteddfod movement . The Welsh term bardd ( poet ) originally referred to the Welsh poets of the Middle Ages , who might be itinerant or attached to a noble household . Some of these medieval poets were known by a pseudonym , for example Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr ( Cynddelw the Master Poet ) , fl . 1155-1200 and Iolo Goch ( Iolo the Red ) , c. 1320 - c. 1398 . The practice seems to have very ancient antecedents , as in the names of the presumably 6th century poets Talhaearn Tad Awen , Blwchfardd and Culfardd , mentioned by the Welsh historian Nennius alongside Taliesin and Aneirin , the last referred to as Aneurin Gwenithwawd ( Aneurin of the Corn Poetry ) . The revival of bardic names became something of a conceit following the reinvention of medieval tradition by Iolo Morganwg in the 18th century . The usage has also extended to Breton and Cornish poetry . In Cornwall , some of the pioneers of the Cornish language movement are referred to by their bardic names , e.g . Mordon for Robert Morton Nance , and Talek for E. G. Retallack Hooper . Many surnames in Wales derive from patronymics rather than , for instance , places of origin . Many people therefore share a limited number of surnames , and many people can share even the full name , so it was common practice to add a nickname to distinguish between people with similar names . For some people , this might be a reference to their occupation within the village , but for those with a literary reputation , whose name would be known across the land , it was common practice to take , or be awarded , a sobriquet .",

  "/wiki/Junior_Common_Room": "In some universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland - particularly collegiate universities such as Oxford and Cambridge , as well as King 's College London , Dublin University , Durham University , University of York , University of Kent and Lancaster University - students and the academic body are organised into a common room , or at Cambridge a combination room . This terminology has , in addition , been taken up in some universities in other English-speaking nations . The terms JCR , MCR , and SCR are used by Harvard University , Yale University , Princeton University , and the University of Toronto .

  "/wiki/English_Civil_War": "The English Civil War ( 1642-1651 ) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians ( Roundheads ) and Royalists ( Cavaliers ) principally over the manner of England 's governance . The first ( 1642-1646 ) and second ( 1648-1649 ) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament , while the third ( 1649-1651 ) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament . The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 . The outcome of the war was threefold : the trial and execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) ; the exile of his son , Charles II ( 1651 ) ; and the replacement of English monarchy with , at first , the Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1653 ) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell ( 1653-1658 ) and briefly his son Richard ( 1658-1659 ) . A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy . Constitutionally , the wars established the precedent that an English monarch can not govern without Parliament 's consent , although the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was only legally established as part of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 .",

  "/wiki/Dodona's_Grove": "This curiosity purports to be a history of Europe since the accession of James I of England put into an allegorical form in which the roles of the various kings , princes and nobles are taken by various trees . Its effect , however , is not quite what that would imply , as the tree-allegory remains on the level of the emblem , whereas the action demands if not people , then anthropomorphs convincingly capable of some sort of agency . Before the book is properly underway there is already a tension between its tenor and supposed vehicle . Having set up an allegorical apparatus , with a comprehensive 'Clavis ' , or key of the significance of the various names which he uses , as well as illustrations of the various trees , the text itself , though conforming vaguely to an allegorical mode , is anything but smooth in its allegorical workings , anything but subtle in its jarring clashes of style and treatment , which take it far away from earlier , more consistently executed examples of the genre .",

The tradition of such a meeting of Welsh artists dates back to at least the 12th century , when a festival of poetry and music was held by Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth at his court in Cardigan in 1176 , but the decline of the bardic tradition made it fall into abeyance . The current format owes much to an 18th-century revival arising out of a number of informal eisteddfodau . The closest English equivalent to eisteddfod is session ; the word is formed from two Welsh morphemes : eistedd , meaning sit , and bod , meaning be . In some countries , the term eisteddfod is used for certain types of performing arts competitions that have nothing to do with Welsh culture . [ citation needed ]",

The Archdruid presides over the most important ceremonies at the National Eisteddfod of Wales including the Crowning of the Bard , the award of the Prose Medal [ cy ] and the Chairing of the Bard . Although Iolo Morganwg was the first to preside over the Gorsedd when the National Eisteddfod came into being , his successor David Griffith , under the bardic name Clwydfardd , was the first to be known by the official title Archdruid . The Archdruid 's regalia , devised by the early revivers of the eisteddfod during the early 19th century , includes a crown , a sceptre , and a breastplate in the form of a torc . These were redesigned in 1896 by Hubert von Herkomer , to be made of gold and decorated with oak leaves , symbolising the sacred groves associated with druidry . ( The Welsh word for oak is derw from which druid is thought to be derived . ) A special ring of office was also introduced . The current sceptre has been in use since 1910 , and a stola or cape was first worn in 1911 by the Archdruid Dyfed . Since 1932 , only former winners of the Eisteddfod Crown or Chair have been qualified to become Archdruid .

  "/wiki/Angel_Mountain_Saga": "The Angel Mountain Saga of eight novels was written by Welsh author Brian John , and was first published at the rate of one volume per year in 2001-2005 , with later volumes in 2007 , 2009 and 2012 . The publisher is Greencroft Books , based in Newport , Pembrokeshire . The novels tell of the life and times of Mistress Martha Morgan , a feisty heroine who starts the series in 1796 as a pregnant and suicidal eighteen-year-old and finishes it by going to her grave in 1855 . In the sixth novel she is resurrected ( or is she ? ) and has further adventures in Merthyr Tydfil and further afield . Volumes seven and eight are placed into gaps in the narrative related in Volume Three . The eight novels are On Angel Mountain ( 2001 ) , House of Angels ( 2002 ) , Dark Angel ( 2003 ) , Rebecca and the Angels ( 2004 ) , Flying with Angels ( 2005 ) , Guardian Angel ( 2007 ) , Sacrifice ( 2009 ) and Conspiracy of Angels ( 2012 ) . The novels have a cult following and have now sold over 80,000 copies excluding Ebook sales - a substantial total for a small regional publisher . Within two years of publication , On Angel Mountain was reprinted three times , and was then bought by Corgi , whose edition first appeared in March 2006 . Corgi also published the second and third books in the series , but their sales were disappointing to the author , and the rights have now reverted to Greencroft Books , with several subsequent reprints . The novels are all set in the rough landscape around the mountain of Carningli in North Pembrokeshire , which is now the scene of literary tourism as fans of the series visit Martha Morgan Country . In the marketing of these novels , as with other regional novels down through the years , the sense of place of the stories has been emphasised in book cover design and in the book marketing strategy .",
  "/wiki/Thomas_Jones_(artist)": "Thomas Jones ( 26 September 1742 - 29 April 1803 ) was a Welsh landscape painter . He was a pupil of Richard Wilson and was best known in his lifetime as a painter of Welsh and Italian landscapes in the style of his master . However , Jones 's reputation grew in the 20th century when more unconventional works by him , not originally intended for exhibition , came to light . Most notable among these is a series of views of Naples which he painted from 1782 to 1783 . By breaking with the conventions of classical landscape painting in favour of direct observation , they look forward to the work of Camille Corot and the Barbizon School in the 19th century . His autobiography , Memoirs of Thomas Jones of Penkerrig , went unpublished until 1951 but is now recognised as an important source of information on the 18th-century art world ."
