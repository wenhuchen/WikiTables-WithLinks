  "/wiki/Jacques_Rivette": "Jacques Rivette ( French : [ \u0292ak \u0281iv\u025bt ] ; 1 March 1928 - 29 January 2016 ) was a French film director and film critic most commonly associated with the French New Wave and the film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma . He made twenty-nine films , including L'amour fou ( 1969 ) , Out 1 ( 1971 ) , Celine and Julie Go Boating ( 1974 ) , and La Belle Noiseuse ( 1991 ) . His work is noted for its improvisation , loose narratives , and lengthy running times . Inspired by Jean Cocteau to become a filmmaker , Rivette shot his first short film at age twenty . He moved to Paris to pursue his career , frequenting Henri Langlois ' Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise and other cin\u00e9-clubs ; there , he met Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , Jean-Luc Godard , \u00c9ric Rohmer , Claude Chabrol and other future members of the New Wave . Rivette began writing film criticism , and was hired by Andr\u00e9 Bazin for Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in 1953 . In his criticism , he expressed an admiration for American films - especially those of genre directors such as John Ford , Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray - and was deeply critical of mainstream French cinema . Rivette 's articles , admired by his peers , were considered the magazine 's best and most aggressive writings , particularly his 1961 article On Abjection and his influential series of interviews with film directors co-written with Truffaut . He continued making short films , including Le Coup de Berger , which is often cited as the first New Wave film . Truffaut later credited Rivette with developing the movement . Although he was the first New Wave director to begin work on a feature film , Paris Belongs to Us was not released until 1961 , by which time Chabrol , Truffaut and Godard released their own first features and popularised the movement worldwide . Rivette became editor of Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma during the early 1960s and publicly fought French censorship of his second feature film , The Nun ( 1966 ) .",

It is the last film of celebrated French director Claude Chabrol ( who died the following year ) and the only time he worked with star G\u00e9rard Depardieu . Chabrol said in an interview that the film is like a novel that Simenon never wrote , a kind of Maigret on vacation .",
  "/wiki/Claude_Chabrol": "Claude Henri Jean Chabrol ( French : [ klod \u0283ab\u0281\u0254l ] ; 24 June 1930 - 12 September 2010 ) was a French film director and a member of the French New Wave ( nouvelle vague ) group of filmmakers who first came to prominence at the end of the 1950s . Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard , Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , \u00c9ric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette , Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma before beginning his career as a film maker . Chabrol 's career began with Le Beau Serge ( 1958 ) , inspired by Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) . Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol , with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity . This is especially apparent in Les Biches ( 1968 ) , La Femme infid\u00e8le ( 1969 ) , and Le Boucher ( 1970 ) - all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran , who was his wife at the time . Sometimes characterized as a mainstream New Wave director , Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career . In 1978 , he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozi\u00e8re . On the strength of that effort , the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary ( 1991 ) and La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie ( 1996 ) . Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper , if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol 's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium.Some of his films become almost private jokes , made to amuse himself . James Monaco has called Chabrol the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave , and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we do n't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard .",
