  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports .

  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people , usually wearing protective gloves , throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring . Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games - it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing , disqualification of an opponent , or resignation of an opponent . When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing , the judges ' scorecards determine the victor . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , professional bouts are considered a draw . In Olympic boxing , because a winner must be declared , judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria . While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history , the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC . The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece , where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules .",

  "/wiki/Sports": "Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which , through casual or organised participation , at least in part aim to use , maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants , and in some cases , entertainment for spectators . Hundreds of sports exist , from those between single contestants , through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants , either in teams or competing as individuals . In certain sports such as racing , many contestants may compete , simultaneously or consecutively , with one winner ; in others , the contest ( a match ) is between two sides , each attempting to exceed the other . Some sports allow a tie or draw , in which there is no single winner ; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser . A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion . Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season , followed in some cases by playoffs . Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity , with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition , and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports . However , a number of competitive , but non-physical , activities claim recognition as mind sports . The International Olympic Committee ( through ARISF ) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports , and SportAccord , the international sports federation association , recognises five non-physical sports : bridge , chess , draughts ( checkers ) , Go and xiangqi , and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports . Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs , which serve to ensure fair competition , and allow consistent adjudication of the winner . Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first . It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance , including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression .",
  "/wiki/Mixed_Martial_Arts": "Mixed martial arts ( MMA ) , also known as cage fighting , is a full-contact combat sport that allows striking and grappling , both standing and on the ground , using techniques from various combat sports and martial arts . The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993 . The term gained popularity when newfullcontact.com , then one of the largest websites covering the sport , hosted and republished the article . The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate . During the early 20th century , various interstylistic contests took place throughout Japan and in the countries of the Four Asian Tigers . In Brazil , there was the sport of Vale Tudo , in which fighters from various styles fought with little to no rules . The Gracie family was known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian jiu-jitsu style . An early high-profile mixed martial arts bout was fought in 1951 , between the judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu-jitsu founder H\u00e9lio Gracie in Brazil . In the West , the concept of combining elements of multiple martial arts was popularized by Bruce Lee 's Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s to early 1970s . A precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki bout , fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan , where it later inspired the foundation of Pancrase in 1993 and Pride Fighting Championships in 1997 . In 1980 , CV Productions , Inc. created the first regulated MMA league in the United States , called Tough Guy Contest , which was later renamed Battle of the Superfighters .

Golf , unlike most ball games , can not and does not utilize a standardized playing area , and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game . The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes , though recreational courses can be smaller , often having nine holes . Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from , and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1\u20444 inches ( 11 cm ) in diameter . There are other standard forms of terrain in between , such as the fairway , rough ( long grass ) , bunkers ( or sand traps ) , and various hazards ( water , rocks ) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement . Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual , known as stroke play , or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team , known as match play . Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels , but most especially at the elite level . The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland . The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764 . Golf 's first major , and the world 's oldest tournament in existence , is The Open Championship , also known as the British Open , which was first played in 1860 in Ayrshire , Scotland . This is one of the four major championships in men 's professional golf , the other three being played in the United States : The Masters , the U.S. Open , and the PGA Championship .",

  "/wiki/American_Football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 .

  "/wiki/Professional_wrestling": "Professional wrestling , often shortened to pro wrestling or simply wrestling , is a form of performance art and entertainment that combines athletics with theatrical performance . It takes the form of events , held by touring companies , that mimic a title-match combat sport . The unique form of sport portrayed is fundamentally based on and evolved from classical and catch wrestling , with modern additions of striking attacks , strength-based holds and throws and acrobatic maneuvers . Much of these derive from the influence of various international martial arts . An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included . The matches have predetermined outcomes to heighten entertainment value and all combative maneuvers are executed with the full cooperation of those involved and carefully performed in specific manners intended to lessen the chance of actual injury . These facts were once kept highly secret but are now publicly acknowledged by both performers and promotions . To promote and sustain the willing suspension of disbelief by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude , the performing company avoids discussing the true nature of the performance in official media . Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media ( i.e. , interviews ) often directly acknowledge the dramatic and fixed nature of the spectacle . [ citation needed ]"
