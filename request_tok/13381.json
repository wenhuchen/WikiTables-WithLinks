  "/wiki/Wings_(band)": "Paul McCartney and Wings ( also known by their original name Wings ) were a British-American rock band formed in 1971 by former Beatle Paul McCartney , his wife Linda on keyboards , session drummer Denny Seiwell , and former Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine . Wings were noted for frequent personnel changes along with their commercial successes , going through three lead guitarists and four drummers . However , the core trio of the McCartneys and Laine remained intact throughout the group 's existence . Created following the McCartneys ' 1971 album Ram , the band 's first two albums , Wild Life ( 1971 ) and Red Rose Speedway ( 1973 ) ( the latter featuring guitarist Henry McCullough ) , were viewed as artistic disappointments beside Paul 's work with the Beatles . After the release of the title track of the James Bond movie Live and Let Die , McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band . The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973 's Band on the Run , a commercial and critical success that spawned two top ten singles in Jet and the title track . Following that album , the band recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton , only for Britton to quit shortly afterwards and be replaced by Joe English . With the new line-up , Wings released 1975 's Venus and Mars , which included the US number one single Listen to What the Man Said , and undertook a highly successful world tour over 1975-76 . Intended as more of a group effort , Wings at the Speed of Sound ( 1976 ) was issued midway through the tour and featured the hit singles Silly Love Songs and Let 'Em In . In 1977 , the band earned their only UK number one single , with Mull of Kintyre , which became the then-best-selling UK single in history . Wings experienced another line-up shuffle , however , with both McCulloch and English departing before the release of the group 's 1978 album London Town . The McCartneys and Laine again added new members , recruiting guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley .",
