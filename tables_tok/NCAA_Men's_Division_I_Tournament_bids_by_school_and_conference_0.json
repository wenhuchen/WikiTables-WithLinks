  "intro": "This is a list of NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament bids by school (divided by their current conference affiliation). Schools whose names are listed in the last table are no longer in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball, and can no longer be included in the tournament. The years listed are the last tournament year a school has reached a certain round of the NCAA Tournament. Because earlier tournaments took place with fewer teams, the years listed are only those in which the school advanced (or received a bye) from an earlier round. For instance, no team is judged to have reached the Elite 8 until the 1951 Tournament because the NCAA tournament started with 8 teams from 1939-50. Similarly, no team is judged to have reached the Sweet 16 until the 1953 Tournament because the tournament started with 16 or fewer teams before 1953. Some schools have NCAA tournament appearances under previous names. For example, UTEP was known as Texas Western when it won its NCAA title in 1966. Additional notes:"
