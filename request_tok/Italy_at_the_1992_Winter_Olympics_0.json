  "/wiki/Alberto_Tomba": "Alberto Tomba ( born 19 December 1966 in San Lazzaro di Savena ) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from Italy . He was the dominant technical skier ( slalom and giant slalom ) in the late 1980s and 1990s . At 6 ft tall and 90 kg , his powerful build was a contrast to the lighter , more traditional technical skiers who prioritised agility over muscle . Tomba was able to take advantage of the introduction of spring-loaded ski gates which replaced the older , solid gates in the early 1980s by using his power to maintain a faster , more direct line through courses . Tomba won three Olympic gold medals , two World Championships , and nine World Cup season titles : four in slalom , four in giant slalom , and one overall title . He was popularly called Tomba la Bomba ( Tomba the Bomb ) .",
