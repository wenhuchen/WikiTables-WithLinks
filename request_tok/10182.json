  "/wiki/Philip_Pullman": "Sir Philip Pullman , CBE , FRSL ( born 19 October 1946 ) is an English novelist . He is the author of several best-selling books , including the fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials and the fictionalised biography of Jesus , The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ . In 2008 , The Times named Pullman one of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945 . In a 2004 poll for the BBC , Pullman was named the eleventh most influential person in British culture . He was knighted in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to literature . Northern Lights , the first volume of Pullman 's His Dark Materials trilogy , won the 1995 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association , recognising the year 's outstanding English-language children 's book . For the 70th anniversary of the medal it was named one of the top ten winning works by a panel assembled to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite . It won the public vote from that shortlist and was thus named the all-time Carnegie of Carnegies in June 2007 . It was adapted as a film under the book 's US title , The Golden Compass . In 2003 , His Dark Materials trilogy was ranked third in the BBC 's The Big Read , a poll of the Top 200 novels voted by the British public .",
  "/wiki/His_Dark_Materials": "His Dark Materials is a trilogy of fantasy novels by Philip Pullman consisting of Northern Lights ( 1995 ) ( published as The Golden Compass in North America ) , The Subtle Knife ( 1997 ) , and The Amber Spyglass ( 2000 ) . It follows the coming of age of two children , Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry , as they wander through a series of parallel universes . The novels have won a number of awards , including the Carnegie Medal in 1995 for Northern Lights and the 2001 Whitbread Book of the Year for The Amber Spyglass . In 2003 , the trilogy was ranked third on the BBCs The Big Read poll . Although His Dark Materials has been marketed as young adult fiction , Pullman wrote with no target audience in mind . The fantasy elements include witches and armoured polar bears ; the trilogy also alludes to concepts from physics , philosophy , and theology . It functions in part as a retelling and inversion of John Milton 's epic Paradise Lost , with Pullman commending humanity for what Milton saw as its most tragic failing , original sin . The series has attracted controversy for its criticism of religion . The London Royal National Theatre staged a two-part adaptation of the series in 2003-2004 . New Line Cinema released a film adaptation of Northern Lights , The Golden Compass , in 2007 . A BBC television series based on the novels commenced broadcast in November 2019 . Pullman followed the trilogy with two novellas set in the Northern Lights universe ; Lyra 's Oxford ( 2003 ) and Once Upon a Time in the North ( 2008 ) .",

  "/wiki/Edmund_Spenser": "Edmund Spenser ( /\u02c8sp\u025bns\u0259r/ ; 1552/1553 - 13 January 1599 ) was an English poet best known for The Faerie Queene , an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I . He is recognized as one of the premier craftsmen of nascent Modern English verse , and is often considered one of the greatest poets in the English language .",
  "/wiki/The_Faerie_Queene": "The Faerie Queene is an English epic poem by Edmund Spenser . Books I-III were first published in 1590 , and then republished in 1596 together with books IV-VI . The Faerie Queene is notable for its form : it is one of the longest poems in the English language as well as the work in which Spenser invented the verse form known as the Spenserian stanza . On a literal level , the poem follows several knights as a means to examine different virtues , and though the text is primarily an allegorical work , it can be read on several levels of allegory , including as praise ( or , later , criticism ) of Queen Elizabeth I . In Spenser 's Letter of the Authors , he states that the entire epic poem is cloudily enwrapped in Allegorical devices , and the aim of publishing The Faerie Queene was to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline . Spenser presented the first three books of The Faerie Queene to Elizabeth I in 1589 , probably sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh . The poem was a clear effort to gain court favour , and as a reward Elizabeth granted Spenser a pension for life amounting to \u00a350 a year , though there is no further evidence that Elizabeth I ever read any of the poem . This royal patronage elevated the poem to a level of success that made it Spenser 's defining work ."
