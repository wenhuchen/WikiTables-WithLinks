As most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team on the playing field at a time , referring to a team 's fans as the 12th man implies that they have a potentially helpful role in the game . Infrequently , the term has referred to individuals having a notable connection to their football team . In Canadian football , 12 players are usually on the field at one time and the term 13th man is often used to refer to fans . Similarly , in Australian rules football , 18 players are on the field and the fans are often referred to as the 19th man . The term has a different meaning in cricket , referring instead to the first substitute player who fields when a member of the fielding side is injured ( the term 6th man has a similar connotation in basketball ) . The presence of fans can have a profound impact on how the teams perform , an element in the home advantage . Namely , the home team fans would like to see their team win the game . Thus these fans will often create loud sounds or chant in hopes of distracting , demoralizing and confusing the opposing team while they have possession of the ball ; or to persuade a referee to make a favorable decision .

He was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award . Maradona 's vision , passing , ball control and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature ( 1.65 m or 5 ft 5 in ) , which gave him a low center of gravity allowing him to maneuver better than most other football players ; he would often dribble past multiple opposing players on a run . His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team 's general performance , while he would often be singled out by the opposition . A precocious talent , Maradona was given the nickname El Pibe de Oro ( The Golden Boy ) , a name that stuck with him throughout his career . An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position , Maradona was the first player in football history to set the world record transfer fee twice , first when he transferred to Barcelona for a then world record \u00a35 million , and second , when he transferred to Napoli for another record fee \u00a36.9 million . He played for Argentinos Juniors , Boca Juniors , Barcelona , Napoli , Sevilla and Newell 's Old Boys during his club career , and is most famous for his time at Napoli and Barcelona where he won numerous accolades . In his international career with Argentina , he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals . Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups , including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico where he captained Argentina and led them to victory over West Germany in the final , and won the Golden Ball as the tournament 's best player . In the 1986 World Cup quarter final , he scored both goals in a 2-1 victory over England that entered football history for two different reasons .",
