  "/wiki/Wells_Cathedral": "Wells Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in Wells , Somerset , England , dedicated to St Andrew the Apostle and seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells , whose cathedra it holds as mother church of the Diocese of Bath and Wells . Built in 1176-1450 to replace an earlier church on the site since 705 , it is moderately sized for an English cathedral . Its broad west front and large central tower are dominant features . It has been called unquestionably one of the most beautiful and most poetic of English cathedrals . Its Gothic architecture is mostly in Early English style of the late 12th - early 13th centuries , lacking the Romanesque work that survives in many other cathedrals . Building began about 1175 at the east end with the choir . Historian John Harvey sees it as Europe 's first truly Gothic structure , breaking the last constraints of Romanesque . The stonework of its pointed arcades and fluted piers bears pronounced mouldings and carved capitals in a foliate , stiff-leaf style . Its Early English front with 300 sculpted figures , is seen as a supreme triumph of the combined plastic arts in England . The east end retains much ancient stained glass . Unlike many cathedrals of monastic foundation , Wells has many surviving secular buildings linked to its chapter of secular canons , including the Bishop 's Palace and the 15th-century residential Vicars ' Close . It is a Grade I listed building .",
  "/wiki/Herbalism": "Herbal medicine ( also herbalism ) is the study of botany and the use of medicinal plants . Plants have been the basis for medical treatments through much of human history , and such traditional medicine is still widely practiced today . Modern medicine makes use of many plant-derived compounds as the basis for evidence-based pharmaceutical drugs . Although herbalism may apply modern standards of effectiveness testing to herbs and medicines derived from natural sources , few high-quality clinical trials and standards for purity or dosage exist . The scope of herbal medicine is sometimes extended to include fungal and bee products , as well as minerals , shells and certain animal parts . Herbal medicine is also called phytomedicine or phytotherapy . Paraherbalism describes alternative and pseudoscientific practices of using unrefined plant or animal extracts as unproven medicines or health-promoting agents . Paraherbalism differs from plant-derived medicines in standard pharmacology because it does not isolate or standardize biologically active compounds , but rather relies on the belief that preserving various substances from a given source with less processing is safer or more effective - for which there is no evidence . Herbal dietary supplements most often fall under the phytotherapy category .",

The county town is the city of Winchester . Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest . Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars . The Isle of Wight , historically part of Hampshire , became a separate ceremonial county in 1974 .",

  "/wiki/Natural_History_and_Antiquities_of_Selborne": "The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne , or just The Natural History of Selborne is a book by English naturalist and ornithologist Gilbert White . It was first published in 1789 by his brother Benjamin . It has been continuously in print since then , with nearly 300 editions up to 2007 . The book was published late in White 's life , compiled from a mixture of his letters to other naturalists - Thomas Pennant and Daines Barrington ; a 'Naturalist 's Calendar ' ( in the second edition ) comparing phenology observations made by White and William Markwick of the first appearances in the year of different animals and plants ; and observations of natural history organized more or less systematically by species and group . A second volume , less often reprinted , covered the antiquities of Selborne . Some of the letters were never posted , and were written for the book . White 's Natural History was at once well received by contemporary critics and the public , and continued to be admired by a diverse range of nineteenth and twentieth century literary figures . His work has been seen as an early contribution to ecology and in particular to phenology . The book has been enjoyed for its charm and apparent simplicity , and the way that it creates a vision of pre-industrial England . The original manuscript has been preserved and is displayed in the Gilbert White museum at The Wakes , Selborne .",

He published important works on botany , zoology , and natural theology . His classification of plants in his Historia Plantarum , was an important step towards modern taxonomy . Ray rejected the system of dichotomous division by which species were classified according to a pre-conceived , either/or type system [ further explanation needed ] , and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation . He was among the first to attempt a biological definition for the concept of species .",
  "/wiki/Natural_history": "Natural history is a domain of inquiry involving organisms , including animals , fungi and plants , in their natural environment , leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study . A person who studies natural history is called a naturalist or natural historian . Natural history encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it . It involves the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms . So while it dates from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world , through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation , today 's natural history is a cross discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences ; e.g. , geobiology has a strong multi-disciplinary nature .",
  "/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)": "In biology , taxonomy ( from Ancient Greek \u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ( taxis ) , meaning 'arrangement ' , and -\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 ( -nomia ) , meaning 'method ' ) is the science of naming , defining ( circumscribing ) and classifying groups of biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics . Organisms are grouped together into taxa ( singular : taxon ) and these groups are given a taxonomic rank ; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a super-group of higher rank , thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy . The principal ranks in modern use are domain , kingdom , phylum ( division is sometimes used in botany in place of phylum ) , class , order , family , genus , and species . The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the founder of the current system of taxonomy , as he developed a system known as Linnaean taxonomy for categorizing organisms and binomial nomenclature for naming organisms . With the advent of such fields of study as phylogenetics , cladistics , and systematics , the Linnaean system has progressed to a system of modern biological classification based on the evolutionary relationships between organisms , both living and extinct .",
  "/wiki/Empiricism": "In philosophy , empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience . It is one of several views of epistemology , along with rationalism and skepticism . Empiricism emphasises the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas , rather than innate ideas or traditions . However , empiricists may argue that traditions ( or customs ) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences . Historically , empiricism was associated with the blank slate concept ( tabula rasa ) , according to which the human mind is blank at birth and develops its thoughts only through experience . Empiricism in the philosophy of science emphasises evidence , especially as discovered in experiments . It is a fundamental part of the scientific method that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on a priori reasoning , intuition , or revelation . Empiricism , often used by natural scientists , says that knowledge is based on experience and that knowledge is tentative and probabilistic , subject to continued revision and falsification . Empirical research , including experiments and validated measurement tools , guides the scientific method .",

  "/wiki/Natural_theology": "Natural theology , once also termed physico-theology , is a type of theology that provides arguments for the existence of God based on reason and ordinary experience of nature . This distinguishes it from revealed theology , which is based on scripture and/or religious experiences , also from transcendental theology , which is based on a priori reasoning . It is thus a type of philosophy , with the aim of explaining the nature of the gods , or of one supreme God . For monotheistic religions , this principally involves arguments about the attributes or non-attributes of God , and especially the existence of God , using arguments that do not involve recourse to supernatural revelation . Marcus Terentius Varro ( 116-27 BC ) established a distinction between political theology ( the social functions of religion ) , natural theology and mythical theology . His terminology became part of the Stoic tradition and then Christianity through Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas .",
  "/wiki/Speed_of_sound": "The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium . At 20 \u00b0C ( 68 \u00b0F ) , the speed of sound in air is about 343 metres per second ( 1,235 km/h ; 1,125 ft/s ; 767 mph ; 667 kn ) , or a kilometre in 2.9 s or a mile in 4.7 s. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a soundwave is propagating . The speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition . The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air , deviating slightly from ideal behavior . In common everyday speech , speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air . However , the speed of sound varies from substance to substance : sound travels most slowly in gases ; it travels faster in liquids ; and faster still in solids . For example , ( as noted above ) , sound travels at 343 m/s in air ; it travels at 1,481 m/s in water ( almost 4.3 times as fast as in air ) ; and at 5,120 m/s in iron ( almost 15 times as fast as in air ) . In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond , sound travels at 12,000 metres per second ( 39,000 ft/s ) - about 35 times as fast as in air - which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions . Sound waves in solids are composed of compression waves ( just as in gases and liquids ) , and a different type of sound wave called a shear wave , which occurs only in solids . Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds , as exhibited in seismology . The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium 's compressibility , shear modulus and density . The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material 's shear modulus and density .",

  "/wiki/Nebulae": "A nebula ( Latin for 'cloud ' or 'fog ' ; pl . nebulae , nebul\u00e6 or nebulas ) is an interstellar cloud of dust , hydrogen , helium and other ionized gases . Originally , the term was used to describe any diffuse astronomical object , including galaxies beyond the Milky Way . The Andromeda Galaxy , for instance , was once referred to as the Andromeda Nebula ( and spiral galaxies in general as spiral nebulae ) before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher , Edwin Hubble and others . Most nebulae are of vast size ; some are hundreds of light-years in diameter . A nebula that is visible to the human eye from Earth would appear larger , but no brighter , from close by . The Orion Nebula , the brightest nebula in the sky and occupying an area twice the diameter of the full Moon , can be viewed with the naked eye but was missed by early astronomers . Although denser than the space surrounding them , most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created on Earth - a nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms . Many nebulae are visible due to fluorescence caused by embedded hot stars , while others are so diffuse they can only be detected with long exposures and special filters . Some nebulae are variably illuminated by T Tauri variable stars . Nebulae are often star-forming regions , such as in the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula . In these regions , the formations of gas , dust , and other materials clump together to form denser regions , which attract further matter , and eventually will become dense enough to form stars .",

Conchology is one aspect of malacology , the study of molluscs ; however , malacology is the study of molluscs as whole organisms , whereas conchology is confined to the study of their shells . It includes the study of land and freshwater mollusc shells as well as seashells and extends to the study of a gastropod 's operculum . Conchology is now sometimes seen as an archaic study , because relying on only one aspect of an organism 's morphology can be misleading . However , a shell often gives at least some insight into molluscan taxonomy , and historically the shell was often the only part of exotic species that was available for study . Even in current museum collections it is common for the dry material ( shells ) to greatly exceed the amount of material that is preserved whole in alcohol . Conchologists mainly deal with four molluscan orders : the gastropods ( snails ) , bivalves ( clams ) , Polyplacophora ( chitons ) and Scaphopoda ( tusk shells ) . Cephalopods only have small internal shells , with the exception of the Nautiloidea . Some groups , such as the sea slug nudibranchs , have lost their shells altogether , while in others it has been replaced by a protein support structure .",

[ I ] His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted , and considered a foundational concept in science . In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace , he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection , in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding . Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history , and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey . Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species . By the 1870s , the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact . However , many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection , and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution . Darwin 's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences , explaining the diversity of life . Darwin 's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh ; instead , he helped to investigate marine invertebrates . Studies at the University of Cambridge ( Christ 's College ) encouraged his passion for natural science . His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell 's conception of gradual geological change , and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author . Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage , Darwin began detailed investigations , and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection .",

  "/wiki/Meteorology": "Meteorology is a branch of the atmospheric sciences which includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics , with a major focus on weather forecasting . The study of meteorology dates back millennia , though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century . The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions . Prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data . It was not until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and more particularly , the development of the computer , allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather , in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved . An important domain of weather forecasting is marine weather forecasting as it relates to maritime and coastal safety , in which weather effects also include atmospheric interactions with large bodies of water . Meteorological phenomena are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology . Meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of Earth 's atmosphere : temperature , air pressure , water vapour , mass flow , and the variations and interactions of those variables , and how they change over time . Different spatial scales are used to describe and predict weather on local , regional , and global levels .

This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use . Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology , entomology is a taxon-based category ; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is , by definition , entomology .

  "/wiki/Beetles": "Beetles are a group of insects that form the order Coleoptera , in the superorder Endopterygota . Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases , elytra , distinguishing them from most other insects . The Coleoptera , with about 400,000 species , is the largest of all orders , constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms ; new species are discovered frequently . The largest of all families , the Curculionidae ( weevils ) , with some 83,000 member species , belongs to this order . Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the polar regions , they interact with their ecosystems in several ways : beetles often feed on plants and fungi , break down animal and plant debris , and eat other invertebrates . Some species are serious agricultural pests , such as the Colorado potato beetle , while others such as Coccinellidae ( ladybirds or ladybugs ) eat aphids , scale insects , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops . Beetles typically have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra , though some such as the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra . The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects , although there are several examples of novelty , such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving . Beetles are endopterygotes , which means that they undergo complete metamorphosis , with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage . Some , such as stag beetles , have a marked sexual dimorphism , the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males . Many beetles are aposematic , with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity , while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects . Many beetles , including those that live in sandy places , have effective camouflage .",

Microbiologists often rely on molecular biology tools such as DNA sequence based identification , for example 16s rRNA gene sequence used for bacteria identification . Viruses have been variably classified as organisms , as they have been considered either as very simple microorganisms or very complex molecules . Prions , never considered as microorganisms , have been investigated by virologists , however , as the clinical effects traced to them were originally presumed due to chronic viral infections , and virologists took search - discovering infectious proteins . The existence of microorganisms was predicted many centuries before they were first observed , for example by the Jains in India and by Marcus Terentius Varro in ancient Rome . The first recorded microscope observation was of the fruiting bodies of moulds , by Robert Hooke in 1666 , but the Jesuit priest Athanasius Kircher was likely the first to see microbes , which he mentioned observing in milk and putrid material in 1658 . Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is considered a father of microbiology as he observed and experimented with microscopic organisms in 1676 , using simple microscopes of his own design . Scientific microbiology developed in the 19th century through the work of Louis Pasteur and in medical microbiology Robert Koch .",
  "/wiki/Unicellular_organism": "A unicellular organism , also known as a single-celled organism , is an organism that consists of a single cell , unlike a multicellular organism that consists of multiple cells . Unicellular organisms fall into two general categories : prokaryotic organisms and eukaryotic organisms . Prokaryotes include bacteria and archaea . Many eukaryotes are multicellular , but the group includes the protozoa , unicellular algae , and unicellular fungi . Unicellular organisms are thought to be the oldest form of life , with early protocells possibly emerging 3.8-4 billion years ago . Although some prokaryotes live in colonies , they are not specialised cells with differing functions . These organisms live together , and each cell must carry out all life processes to survive . In contrast , even the simplest multicellular organisms have cells that depend on each other to survive . Most multicellular organisms have a unicellular life-cycle stage . Gametes , for example , are reproductive unicells for multicellular organisms . Additionally , multicellularity appears to have evolved independently many times in the history of life . Some organisms are partially unicellular , like Dictyostelium discoideum .",
  "/wiki/Spontaneous_generation": "Spontaneous generation refers to an obsolete body of thought on the ordinary formation of living organisms without descent from similar organisms . The theory of spontaneous generation held that living creatures could arise from nonliving matter and that such processes were commonplace and regular . For instance , it was hypothesized that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust , or that maggots could arise from dead flesh . A variant idea was that of equivocal generation , in which species such as tapeworms arose from unrelated living organisms , now understood to be their hosts . [ citation needed ] The idea of univocal generation , by contrast , refers to effectively exclusive reproduction from genetically related parent ( s ) , generally of the same species . [ citation needed ] The doctrine of spontaneous generation was coherently synthesized by Aristotle , who compiled and expanded the work of earlier natural philosophers and the various ancient explanations for the appearance of organisms , and was taken as scientific fact for two millennia . Though challenged in the 17th and 18th centuries by the experiments of Francesco Redi and Lazzaro Spallanzani , spontaneous generation was not disproved until the work of Louis Pasteur and John Tyndall in the mid-19th century .",

  "/wiki/Darwinism": "Darwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin ( 1809-1882 ) and others , stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small , inherited variations that increase the individual 's ability to compete , survive , and reproduce . Also called Darwinian theory , it originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859 , including concepts which predated Darwin 's theories . English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term Darwinism in April 1860 .",
