  "/wiki/University_of_California": "The University of California ( UC ) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California . Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education , the University of California is a part of the state 's three-system public higher education plan , which also includes the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System . The University of California was founded on March 23 , 1868 , and operated in Oakland before moving to its campus in Berkeley in 1873 . In March 1951 , the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from its campus at Berkeley , with Robert Gordon Sproul remaining in place as the first systemwide President , Clark Kerr becoming the first Chancellor of UC Berkeley , and Raymond B. Allen became the first Chancellor of UCLA . However , the 1951 reorganization was stalled by resistance from Sproul and his allies , and it was not until Kerr succeeded Sproul as President that UC was able to evolve into a system from 1957 to 1960 . In the 21st century , the University of California has 10 campuses , a combined student body of 280,380 students , 21,200 faculty members , 144,000 staff members and over 1.86 million living alumni , as governed by a semi-autonomous Board of Regents . Its tenth and newest campus in Merced opened in fall 2005 . Nine campuses enroll both undergraduate and graduate students ; one campus , UC San Francisco , enrolls only graduate and professional students in the medical and health sciences . In addition , the UC Hastings College of Law , located in San Francisco , is legally affiliated with UC , but other than sharing its name is entirely autonomous from the rest of the system . The University of California also manages or co-manages three national laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy : Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( LBNL ) , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) , and Los Alamos National Laboratory ( LANL ) . Collectively , the colleges , institutions , and alumni of the University of California make it the most comprehensive and advanced postsecondary educational system in the world , responsible for nearly $ 50 billion per year of economic impact . UC campuses have large numbers of distinguished faculty in almost every academic discipline , with UC faculty and researchers having won at least 62 Nobel Prizes as of 2017 .",
  "/wiki/Stanford_University": "Stanford University , officially Leland Stanford Junior University , is a private research university in Stanford , California . Stanford is known for its academic achievements , wealth , close proximity to Silicon Valley , and selectivity ; it ranks as one of the world 's top universities . The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child , Leland Stanford Jr. , who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year . Stanford was a U.S . Senator and former Governor of California who made his fortune as a railroad tycoon . The school admitted its first students on October 1 , 1891 , as a coeducational and non-denominational institution . Stanford University struggled financially after the death of Leland Stanford in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . Following World War II , Provost Frederick Terman supported faculty and graduates ' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley . The university is also one of the top fundraising institutions in the country , becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year . The university is organized around three traditional schools consisting of 40 academic departments at the undergraduate and graduate level and four professional schools that focus on graduate programs in law , medicine , education , and business . Students compete in 36 varsity sports , and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference . It has gained 126 NCAA team championships , and Stanford has won the NACDA Directors ' Cup for 24 consecutive years , beginning in 1994-1995 .",

  "/wiki/Order_of_Australia": "The Order of Australia is an order of chivalry established on 14 February 1975 by Elizabeth II , Queen of Australia , to recognise Australian citizens and other persons for achievement or meritorious service . Before the establishment of the order , Australian citizens received British honours . The Queen of Australia is sovereign head of the order , while the Governor-General of Australia is the principal companion/dame/knight ( as relevant at the time ) and chancellor of the order .

  "/wiki/Queen's_Counsel": "In the United Kingdom and in some Commonwealth countries , a Queen 's Counsel ( post-nominal QC ) during the reign of a queen , or King 's Counsel ( post-nominal KC ) during the reign of a king , is a lawyer ( usually a barrister or advocate ) who is appointed by the monarch of the country to be one of Her [ His ] Majesty 's Counsel learned in the law . The position originated in England . Some Commonwealth countries have either abolished the position , or re-named it so as to remove monarchical connotations , for example , Senior Counsel or Senior Advocate . Queen 's Counsel is an office , conferred by the Crown , that is recognised by courts . Members have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court . The term is recognised as an honorific . As members wear silk gowns of a particular design ( see court dress ) , appointment as Queen 's Counsel is known informally as taking silk and QCs are often colloquially called silks . Appointments are made from within the legal profession on the basis of merit rather than a particular level of experience . However , successful applicants tend to be barristers , or ( in Scotland ) advocates with 15 years of experience or more .",
  "/wiki/Barrister": "A barrister is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions . Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation . Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals , drafting legal pleadings , researching the philosophy , hypothesis and history of law , and giving expert legal opinions . Barristers are distinguished from solicitors , who have more direct access to clients , and may do transactional-type legal work . It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges , and they are rarely hired by clients directly . In some legal systems , including those of Scotland , South Africa , Scandinavia , Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , and the British Crown dependencies of Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man , the word barrister is also regarded as an honorific title . In a few jurisdictions , barristers are usually forbidden from conducting litigation , and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor , who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court , and drafting court documents . In England and Wales , barristers may seek authorisation from the Bar Standards Board to conduct litigation . This allows a barrister to practise in a 'dual capacity ' , fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor . In some countries with common law legal systems , such as New Zealand and some regions of Australia , lawyers are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors , but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister .",
  "/wiki/Human_rights": "Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour and are regularly protected as natural and legal rights in municipal and international law . They are commonly understood as inalienable , fundamental rights to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being and which are inherent in all human beings , regardless of their age , ethnic origin , location , language , religion , ethnicity , or any other status . They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal , and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone . They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others , and it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances ; for example , human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment , torture , and execution . The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law and global and regional institutions . Actions by states and non-governmental organisations form a basis of public policy worldwide . The idea of human rights suggests that if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language , it is that of human rights . The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable scepticism and debates about the content , nature and justifications of human rights to this day . The precise meaning of the term right is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate ; while there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights such as the right to a fair trial , protection against enslavement , prohibition of genocide , free speech or a right to education , there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights ; some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst-case abuses , while others see it as a higher standard . Many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the events of the Holocaust , culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 . Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights . The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke , Francis Hutcheson and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution .",

  "/wiki/United_Nations": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security , develop friendly relations among nations , achieve international cooperation , and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations . It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",
