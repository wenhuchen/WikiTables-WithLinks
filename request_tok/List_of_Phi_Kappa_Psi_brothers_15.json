  "/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials": "A precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the Reichsgericht ( German Supreme Court ) in Leipzig , although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual . At the beginning of 1940 , the Polish government-in-exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country . The British initially declined to do so ; however , in April 1940 , a joint declaration was issued by the British , French and Polish . Relatively bland because of Anglo-French reservations , it proclaimed the trio 's desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which can not remain unpunished . Three-and-a-half years later , the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant . On 1 November 1943 , the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom and the United States published their Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe , which gave a full warning that , when the Nazis were defeated , the Allies would pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth . in order that justice may be done . . The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the major war criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by a joint decision of the Government of the Allies . This intention by the Allies to dispense justice was reiterated at the Yalta Conference and at Potsdam in 1945 . British War Cabinet documents , released on 2 January 2006 , showed that as early as December 1944 the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured . The British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances , with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles , being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war .",
