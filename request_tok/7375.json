  "/wiki/Snake_River": "The Snake River is a major river of the greater Pacific Northwest region in the United States . At 1,078 miles ( 1,735 km ) long , it is the largest tributary of the Columbia River , in turn the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean . The Snake River rises in western Wyoming , then flows through the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho , the rugged Hells Canyon on the Oregon-Idaho border and the rolling Palouse Hills of Washington , emptying into the Columbia River at the Tri-Cities , Washington . The Snake River drainage basin encompasses parts of six U.S. states and is known for its varied geologic history . The Snake River Plain was created by a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath the Snake River headwaters in Yellowstone National Park . Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes that occurred during the previous Ice Age carved out canyons , cliffs and waterfalls along the middle and lower Snake River . Two of these catastrophic flooding events , the Missoula Floods and Bonneville Flood , significantly affected the river and its surroundings . Prehistoric Native Americans lived along the Snake starting more than 11,000 years ago . Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the millions in the river , and were a vital resource for people living on the Snake downstream of Shoshone Falls . By the time Lewis and Clark explored the area , the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the dominant Native American groups in the region . Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin . At one point , sign language used by the Shoshones representing weaving baskets was misinterpreted to represent a snake , giving the Snake River its name .",
