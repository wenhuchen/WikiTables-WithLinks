  "/wiki/Barlow_Road": "The Barlow Road ( at inception , Mount Hood Road ) is a historic road in what is now the U.S. state of Oregon . It was built in 1846 by Sam Barlow and Philip Foster , with authorization of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon , and served as the last overland segment of the Oregon Trail . Its construction allowed covered wagons to cross the Cascade Range and reach the Willamette Valley , which had previously been nearly impossible . Even so , it was by far the most harrowing 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the nearly 2,000-mile ( 3,200 km ) Oregon Trail . Before the opening of the Barlow Road , pioneers traveling by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission ( now The Dalles ) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver , then a perilous and expensive journey . It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass on the north side of Mount Hood , but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons . A trading post ( allowed by the Department of War ) had been built where river crossings could be made along with the disassembly of wagons to make rafts suitable for floating down the remainder of the Columbia . [ citation needed ] The Barlow Road begins at Wascopam Mission and heads south to Tygh Valley ( some consider Tygh Valley the origin ) , then turns west and roughly parallels the White River on the north and then west , crosses the south shoulder of Mount Hood at Barlow Pass , follows Camp Creek and the Sandy River for some way , and finally leads to Oregon City . The road was rendered largely irrelevant in the early 1900s by the construction of the Mount Hood Highway . It still exists as a dirt road in some places , while many other parts have been paved over by newer streets and highways .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Hood_National_Forest": "The Mount Hood National Forest is 62 miles ( 100 km ) east of the city of Portland , Oregon , and the northern Willamette River valley .

  "/wiki/Cascade_Locks_and_Canal": "The Cascade Locks and Canal was a navigation project on the Columbia River between the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington , completed in 1896 . It allowed the steamboats of the Columbia River to bypass the Cascades Rapids , and thereby opened a passage from the lower parts of the river as far as The Dalles .

  "/wiki/Columbia_River": "The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America . The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia , Canada . It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington , then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean . The river is 1,243 miles ( 2,000 km ) long , and its largest tributary is the Snake River . Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province . The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume , the Columbia has the greatest flow of any North American river entering the Pacific . The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region 's culture and economy for thousands of years . They have been used for transportation since ancient times , linking the region 's many cultural groups . The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish , which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean . These fish - especially the salmon species - provided the core subsistence for native peoples . In the late 18th century , a private American ship became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river ; it was followed by a British explorer , who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley . In the following decades , fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route .",

  "/wiki/Mount_Hood": "Mount Hood , called Wy'east by the Multnomah tribe , is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc . It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States . It is located about 50 miles ( 80 km ) east-southeast of Portland , on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties . In addition to being Oregon 's highest mountain , it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence , and it offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America . The height assigned to Mount Hood 's snow-covered peak has varied over its history . Modern sources point to three different heights : 11,249 feet ( 3,429 m ) , a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey ( NGS ) , 11,240 feet ( 3,426 m ) based on a 1993 scientific expedition , and 11,239 feet ( 3,425.6 m ) of slightly older origin . The peak is home to 12 named glaciers and snowfields . It is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range . Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt , though based on its history , an explosive eruption is unlikely . Still , the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7% , so the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) characterizes it as potentially active , but the mountain is informally considered dormant .",

The then-48-room hotel closed in 1952 , when it was sold to the Neighbors of Woodcraft , a non-profit fraternal benefit society based in Oregon since 1905 , and converted into a retirement home . It was sold again in 1978 , with the new owners planning to reopen it as a hotel . After a $ 1-million renovation , the now-42-room hotel reopened in September 1979 . In January 2009 , the landmark hotel closed its doors again , due to foreclosure .

  "/wiki/Historic_Columbia_River_Highway": "The Historic Columbia River Highway is an approximately 75-mile-long ( 121 km ) scenic highway in the U.S. state of Oregon between Troutdale and The Dalles , built through the Columbia River Gorge between 1913 and 1922 . As the first planned scenic roadway in the United States , it has been recognized in numerous ways , including a listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark , designation as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers , and considered a destination unto itself as an All-American Road by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation . The historic roadway was bypassed by the present Columbia River Highway No . 2 ( Interstate 84 ) from the 1930s to the 1950s , leaving behind the old two-lane road . The road is now mostly owned and maintained by the state through the Oregon Department of Transportation as the Historic Columbia River Highway No . 100 ( still partially marked as U.S. Route 30 ; see Oregon highways and routes ) or the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department as the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail . The original highway was promoted by lawyer and entrepreneur Sam Hill and engineer Samuel C. Lancaster , to be modeled after the great scenic roads of Europe . From the very beginning , the roadway was envisioned not just as means of traveling by the then popular Model T , but designed with an elegance that took full advantage of all the natural beauty along the route . When the United States highway system was officially established in 1926 , the highway became the part of U.S. Route 30 . Since then , modern Interstate 84 has been built parallel to the highway between Portland and The Dalles , replacing it as the main travel route and resulting in the loss of some of the original sections of road .",
