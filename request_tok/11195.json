Hawkins , the county physician and health officer of Douglas County . The hospital was regarded as one of Nevada 's best , and it included modern tools such as an X-ray machine , a rarity in small town hospitals at the time . While Hawkins anticipated that Douglas County would need a modern hospital for its growing population , the county 's population actually fell at the 1920 census , and the community struggled to keep its hospital open . Hawkins sold the hospital in 1918 , and it closed in 1924 . The building was used for housing until 1958 , when it was vacated . The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 29 , 1979 .",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_395": "U.S. Route 395 ( US 395 ) is a U.S. Route in the western United States . The southern terminus of the route is in the Mojave Desert at Interstate 15 near Hesperia . The northern terminus is at the Canada-US border near Laurier , where the road becomes Highway 395 upon entering British Columbia , Canada . Before 1964 , the route extended south to San Diego . I-15 , I-215 , and California State Route 163 replaced the stretch of 395 that ran from San Diego to Hesperia through Riverside and San Bernardino . Old Highway 395 can be seen along or near I-15 in many locations before it branches off at Hesperia to head north . The route runs through the U.S. states of California , Nevada , Oregon , and Washington . US 395 runs along the Eastern Sierra in the Owens Valley and crosses through the Modoc Plateau along its routing . The route started out as a spur of U.S. Route 195 and ran north from Spokane . As a result , the route never intersects its parent , U.S. Route 95 ; it maintains a connection through US 195 . US 395 developed into a parallel of its parent route when extended south in the early 1930s . US 395 stays west of its parent route , which runs through Arizona , California , Nevada , Oregon and Idaho .",

From there , US 50 continues through Maryland as a high-speed road to Ocean City .

US 50 passes through a total of 12 states ; California , Nevada , Utah , Colorado , Kansas , Missouri , Illinois , Indiana , Ohio , West Virginia , Virginia , and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia . US 50 was created in 1926 as part of the original U.S. Highway system .

The Nevada portion crosses the center of the state and was named The Loneliest Road in America by Life magazine in July 1986 . The name was intended as a pejorative , but Nevada officials seized it as a marketing slogan . The name originates from large desolate areas traversed by the route , with few or no signs of civilization . The highway crosses several large desert valleys separated by numerous mountain ranges towering over the valley floors , in what is known as the Basin and Range province of the Great Basin . US 50 has a diverse route through the state , traversing the resort communities of Lake Tahoe , the state capital in Carson City , historical sites such as Fort Churchill State Historic Park , petroglyphs , alpine forests , desert valleys , ghost towns , and Great Basin National Park .

The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County 's only jail from 1910 to 1915 . Prior to 1910 , the only county jail was in Genoa , the county seat ; however , since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa , it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge 's granary . As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners , the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail . However , local leaders in Minden , who wanted to move the county seat to their town , protested the move , as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself . Nonetheless , the county approved the construction of the new jail . The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished , as the Genoa jail burned down ; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him . Once completed , the jail served the county until 1915 , when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail . Once it no longer served as the county jail , the Gardnerville jail took on another , racially charged purpose . Gardnerville was a sundown town , and it rang a bell every night to order American Indians out of town .
