  "/wiki/Jacquard_Loom": "The Jacquard machine ( French : [ \u0292aka\u0281 ] ) is a device fitted to a power loom that simplifies the process of manufacturing textiles with such complex patterns as brocade , damask and matelass\u00e9 . It was invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804 , based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon ( 1725 ) , Jean Baptiste Falcon ( 1728 ) , and Jacques Vaucanson ( 1740 ) . The machine was controlled by a chain of cards ; a number of punched cards laced together into a continuous sequence . Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card , with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design . Several such paper cards , generally white in color , can be seen in the images below . Chains , like Bouchon 's earlier use of paper tape , allowed sequences of any length to be constructed , not limited by the size of a card . Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor . This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving inventions as Jacquard shedding made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of pattern weaving . The term Jacquard is not specific or limited to any particular loom , but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning . The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles , such as jerseys . This use of replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware .",
  "/wiki/Joseph_Marie_Jacquard": "Joseph Marie Charles dit ( called or nicknamed ) Jacquard ( French : [ \u0292aka\u0281 ] ; 7 July 1752 - 7 August 1834 ) was a French weaver and merchant . He played an important role in the development of the earliest programmable loom ( the Jacquard loom ) , which in turn played an important role in the development of other programmable machines , such as an early version of digital compiler used by IBM to develop the modern day computer .",
  "/wiki/Plankalk\u00fcl": "Plankalk\u00fcl ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8pla\u02d0nkalky\u02d0l ] ) is a programming language designed for engineering purposes by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945 . It was the first high-level programming language to be designed for a computer . Kalk\u00fcl is the German term for a formal system - as in Hilbert-Kalk\u00fcl , the original name for the Hilbert-style deduction system - so Plankalk\u00fcl refers to a formal system for planning .",
  "/wiki/Konrad_Zuse": "Konrad Zuse ( German : [ \u02c8k\u0254n\u0281at \u02c8tsu\u02d0z\u0259 ] ; 22 June 1910 - 18 December 1995 ) was a German civil engineer , pioneering computer scientist , inventor and businessman . His greatest achievement was the world 's first programmable computer ; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941 . Thanks to this machine and its predecessors , Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer . Zuse was also noted for the S2 computing machine , considered the first process control computer . He founded one of the earliest computer businesses in 1941 , producing the Z4 , which became the world 's first commercial computer . From 1943 to 1945 he designed the first high-level programming language , Plankalk\u00fcl . In 1969 , Zuse suggested the concept of a computation-based universe in his book Rechnender Raum ( Calculating Space ) . Much of his early work was financed by his family and commerce , but after 1939 he was given resources by the Nazi German government . Due to World War II , Zuse 's work went largely unnoticed in the United Kingdom and the United States . Possibly his first documented influence on a US company was IBM 's option on his patents in 1946 . There is a replica of the Z3 , as well as the original Z4 , in the Deutsches Museum in Munich . The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has an exhibition devoted to Zuse , displaying twelve of his machines , including a replica of the Z1 and several of Zuse 's paintings .",
  "/wiki/ENIAC": "ENIAC ( /\u02c8\u025bni\u00e6k/ ; Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer ) was the first electronic general-purpose digital computer . It was Turing-complete , and able to solve a large class of numerical problems through reprogramming . Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army 's Ballistic Research Laboratory ( which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory ) , its first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon . ENIAC was completed in 1945 and first put to work for practical purposes on December 10 , 1945 . ENIAC was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania on February 15 , 1946 and was heralded as a Giant Brain by the press . It had a speed on the order of one thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines ; this computational power , coupled with general-purpose programmability , excited scientists and industrialists alike . The combination of speed and programmability allowed for thousands more calculations for problems , as ENIAC calculated a trajectory in 30 seconds that took a human 20 hours ( allowing one ENIAC hour to displace 2,400 human hours ) . The completed machine was announced to the public the evening of February 14 , 1946 and formally dedicated the next day at the University of Pennsylvania , having cost almost $ 500,000 ( approximately $ 6,300,000 today ) . It was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946 . ENIAC was shut down on November 9 , 1946 for a refurbishment and a memory upgrade , and was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground , Maryland in 1947 . There , on July 29 , 1947 , it was turned on and was in continuous operation until 11:45 p.m. on October 2 , 1955 .",

Von Neumann was generally regarded as the foremost mathematician of his time and said to be the last representative of the great mathematicians ; who integrated both pure and applied sciences . He made major contributions to a number of fields , including mathematics ( foundations of mathematics , functional analysis , ergodic theory , representation theory , operator algebras , geometry , topology , and numerical analysis ) , physics ( quantum mechanics , hydrodynamics , and quantum statistical mechanics ) , economics ( game theory ) , computing ( Von Neumann architecture , linear programming , self-replicating machines , stochastic computing ) , and statistics . He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis , and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata , the universal constructor and the digital computer . He published over 150 papers in his life : about 60 in pure mathematics , 60 in applied mathematics , 20 in physics , and the remainder on special mathematical subjects or non-mathematical ones . His last work , an unfinished manuscript written while he was in hospital , was later published in book form as The Computer and the Brain . His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA . In a short list of facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences , he stated , The part of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics , which developed in G\u00f6ttingen in 1926 , and subsequently in Berlin in 1927-1929 . Also , my work on various forms of operator theory , Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935-1939 ; on the ergodic theorem , Princeton , 1931-1932 . During World War II , von Neumann worked on the Manhattan Project with theoretical physicist Edward Teller , mathematician Stanis\u0142aw Ulam and others , problem solving key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb . He developed the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon , and coined the term kiloton ( of TNT ) , as a measure of the explosive force generated . After the war , he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission , and consulted for a number of organizations , including the United States Air Force , the Army 's Ballistic Research Laboratory , the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project , and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .",

  "/wiki/Alan_Turing": "Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS ( /\u02c8tj\u028a\u0259r\u026a\u014b/ ; 23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954 ) was an English mathematician , computer scientist , logician , cryptanalyst , philosopher , and theoretical biologist . Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science , providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine , which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer . Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence . Despite these accomplishments , he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime , due to his homosexuality , and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act . During the Second World War , Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School ( GC & CS ) at Bletchley Park , Britain 's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence . For a time he led Hut 8 , the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis . Here , he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers , including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method , an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine . Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements , including the Battle of the Atlantic , and in so doing helped win the war . Due to the problems of counterfactual history , it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war , but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives . After the war , Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory , where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine , which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer . In 1948 , Turing joined Max Newman 's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester , where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology . He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction , first observed in the 1960s .",
