Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders , which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks , the megamouth shark and the basking shark . They feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes , and pose no threat to humans .

Andrew Smith , a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town , described it the following year . The name whale shark refers to the fish 's size , being as large as some species of whales , and also to its being a filter feeder like baleen whales .",

Creative direction of American Dad ! has largely been guided by Barker ( prior to his exit from the show in season 10 ) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane , resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts . Unlike MacFarlane 's other shows , Family Guy and , to a lesser extent , The Cleveland Show , American Dad ! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags , and is less concerned with conventional setup-punchline jokes , instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters , the relationships between family members , and the relatively relatable plots . While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes , the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements , pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce . The plots are often absurd , but they are grounded by family stories and real-world issues .",
