  "section_text": "See also : List of Premier League managers Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team , including the training , team selection and player acquisition . Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans . [ 169 ] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available , and follows the completion of the UEFA ' B ' and ' A ' Licences . [ 170 ] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis ( i.e. , more than 12 weeks , the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control ) . [ 171 ] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment . Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker , including Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur . Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is the longest-serving manager , having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his retirement at the conclusion of the 2017\u201318 season , and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828 , all with Arsenal . He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson , who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League 's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season . Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season , meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League . [ 172 ] During the 2019\u201320 season , 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December : Javi Gracia and Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores of Watford , Mauricio Pochettino of Tottenham Hotspur , Unai Emery of Arsenal , Marco Silva of Everton and Manuel Pellegrini of West Ham United . There have been several studies into the reasoning behind , and effects of , managerial sackings . Most famously , Professor Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam , performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings . Bridgewater 's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match .

  "intro": "The Premier League, often referred to as the English Premier League or the EPL outside England, is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The Premier League has featured 49 different teams since its inception: 47 English and two Welsh clubs. The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth \u00a31 billion a year domestically as of 2013-14, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively. The league is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders, and generates \u20ac2.2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights. Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of \u00a32.4 billion in 2016-17, with a further \u00a3343 million in solidarity payments to English Football League (EFL) clubs. The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018-19 season average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181, second to the Bundesliga's 43,500, while aggregated attendance across all matches is the highest of any league at 14,508,981. Most stadium occupancies are near capacity."
