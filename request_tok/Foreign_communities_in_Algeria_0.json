Its surface area amounts to 266,000 square kilometres ( 103,000 sq mi ) . It is one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world , mainly consisting of desert flatlands . The population is estimated at just over 500,000 , of which nearly 40% live in Laayoune , the largest city in Western Sahara . Occupied by Spain until the late 20th century , Western Sahara has been on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since 1963 after a Moroccan demand . It is the most populous territory on that list , and by far the largest in area . In 1965 , the UN General Assembly adopted its first resolution on Western Sahara , asking Spain to decolonize the territory . One year later , a new resolution was passed by the General Assembly requesting that a referendum be held by Spain on self-determination . In 1975 , Spain relinquished the administrative control of the territory to a joint administration by Morocco ( which had formally claimed the territory since 1957 ) and Mauritania . A war erupted between those countries and a Sahrawi nationalist movement , the Polisario Front , which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ( SADR ) with a government in exile in Tindouf , Algeria . Mauritania withdrew its claims in 1979 , and Morocco eventually secured de facto control of most of the territory , including all the major cities and natural resources . The United Nations considers the Polisario Front to be the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people , and maintains that the Sahrawis have a right to self-determination .",
