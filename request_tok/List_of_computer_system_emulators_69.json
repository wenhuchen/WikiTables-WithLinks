  "/wiki/MAME": "MAME ( originally an acronym of Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator ) is a free and open-source emulator designed to recreate the hardware of arcade game systems in software on modern personal computers and other platforms . The intention is to preserve gaming history by preventing vintage games from being lost or forgotten . The aim of MAME is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines ; the ability to actually play the games is considered a nice side effect . Joystiq has listed MAME as an application that every Windows and Mac gamer should have . The first public MAME release was by Nicola Salmoria on February 5 , 1997 . The emulator now supports over 7,000 unique games and 10,000 actual ROM image sets , though not all of the supported games are playable . MESS , an emulator for many video game consoles and computer systems , based on the MAME core , was integrated upstream into MAME in 2015 .",
  "/wiki/Multi_Emulator_Super_System": "Multi Emulator Super System ( MESS ) was an emulator for various consoles and computer systems , based on the MAME core and now a part of MAME . MESS emulates portable and console gaming systems , computer platforms , and calculators . The project strives for accuracy and portability and therefore is not always the fastest emulator for any one particular system . Its accuracy makes it also useful for homebrew game development . As of April 2015 MESS supported 994 unique systems with 2,106 total system variations . However , not all of the systems in MESS are functional ; some are marked as non-working or are in development . MESS was first released in 1998 and has been under constant development since . MAME and MESS were once separate applications , but were later developed and released together from a single source repository . MAMEDEV member David Haywood maintained and distributed UME ( Universal Machine Emulator ) which combined much of the functionality of MAME and MESS in a single application . On May 27 , 2015 , MESS was formally integrated with MAME and became a part of MAME .",
  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing , cross-platform software ( also multi-platform software or platform-independent software ) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms . Cross-platform software may be divided into two types ; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports , and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation , e.g. , software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms . For example , a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS . Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms , or on as few as two platforms . Cross-platform frameworks ( such as Qt , Flutter , NativeScript , Xamarin , Phonegap , Ionic , and React Native ) exist to aid cross-platform development .",
  "/wiki/New_BSD": "BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses , imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software . This is in contrast to copyleft licenses , which have share-alike requirements . The original BSD license was used for its namesake , the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , a Unix-like operating system . The original version has since been revised , and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses . BSD is both a license and a class of license ( generally referred to as BSD-like ) . The modified BSD license ( in wide use today ) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix . The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format , or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format . The BSD license ( unlike some other licenses ) does not require that source code be distributed at all .",
  "/wiki/GPLv2": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer": "The RadioShack TRS-80 Color Computer ( later marketed as the Tandy Color Computer and sometimes nicknamed the CoCo ) is a line of home computers based on the Motorola 6809 processor . The Tandy Color Computer line started in 1980 with what is now called the CoCo 1 and ended in 1991 with the more powerful CoCo 3 . All three CoCo models maintained a high level of software and hardware compatibility , with few programs written for the older model being unable to run on the newer ones . Despite bearing the TRS-80 name , the Color Computer is a radical departure from the earlier TRS-80 . In particular it has a Motorola 6809E processor , rather than the TRS-80 's Zilog Z80 . The machines in the Color Computer line are not compatible with software made for the earlier TRS-80 .",
  "/wiki/Java_applet": "A Java applet was a small application written in the Java programming language , or another programming language that compiles to Java bytecode , and delivered to users in the form of Java bytecode . The user launched the Java applet from a web page , and the applet was then executed within a Java virtual machine ( JVM ) in a process separate from the web browser itself . A Java applet could appear in a frame of the web page , a new application window , Sun 's AppletViewer , or a stand-alone tool for testing applets . Java applets were introduced in the first version of the Java language , which was released in 1995 . Beginning in 2013 , major web browsers began to phase out support for the underlying technology applets used to run , with applets becoming completely unable to be run by 2015-2017 . Java applets were deprecated since Java 9 in 2017 and removed from Java SE 11 ( 18.9 ) , released in September 2018 . Java applets were usually written in Java , but other languages such as Jython , JRuby , Pascal , Scala , or Eiffel ( via SmartEiffel ) may be used as well . Java applets run at very fast speeds and until 2011 , they were many times faster than JavaScript . Unlike JavaScript , Java applets had access to 3D hardware acceleration , making them well-suited for non-trivial , computation-intensive visualizations . As browsers have gained support for hardware-accelerated graphics thanks to the canvas technology ( or specifically WebGL in the case of 3D graphics ) , as well as just-in-time compiled JavaScript , the speed difference has become less noticeable . [ citation needed ] Since Java bytecode is cross-platform ( or platform independent ) , Java applets can be executed by browsers ( or other clients ) for many platforms , including Microsoft Windows , FreeBSD , Unix , macOS and Linux . They can not be run on modern mobile devices , which do not support Java .",
  "/wiki/Open-source_software": "Open-source software ( OSS ) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study , change , and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose . Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner . Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration . Open-source software development can bring in diverse perspectives beyond those of a single company . A 2008 report by the Standish Group stated that adoption of open-source software models has resulted in savings of about $ 60 billion ( \u00a348 billion ) per year for consumers .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/Shareware": "Shareware is a type of proprietary software which is initially provided free of charge to users , who are allowed and encouraged to make and share copies of the program . Shareware is often offered as a download from a website or on a compact disc included with a magazine . [ citation needed ] Shareware differs from open-source software , in which the source code is available for anyone to inspect and alter ; and freeware , which is software distributed at no cost to the user but without source code being made available . There are many types of shareware , and while they may not require an initial up-front payment , many are intended to generate revenue in one way or another . Some limit use to personal non-commercial purposes only , with purchase of a license required for use in a business enterprise . The software itself may be limited in functionality or be time-limited , or it may remind the user that payment would be appreciated .",
  "/wiki/TRS-80": "The TRS-80 Micro Computer System ( TRS-80 , later renamed the Model I to distinguish it from successors ) is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their RadioShack stores . The name is an abbreviation of Tandy/RadioShack , Z80 microprocessor . It is one of the earliest mass-produced and mass-marketed retail home computers . The TRS-80 has a full-stroke QWERTY keyboard , the Zilog Z80 processor ( rather than the more common Intel 8080 ) , 4 KB DRAM standard memory ( when many 8-bit computers shipped with only 1 KB RAM ) , small size and desk footprint , floating-point BASIC language interpreter in ROM , 64-character per line video monitor , and a starting price of US $ 600 ( equivalent to US $ 2500 in 2019 ) . A cassette tape drive for program storage was included in the original base package , but it proved slow and fiddly in practice . While the software environment was stable and capable , the fiddly program load/save process combined with keyboard bounce issues and a troublesome expansion interface contributed to the Model I 's widespread reputation as something fun to tinker with for computer enthusiasts , but not well suited to serious use . As with many small computers of the era , it lacked full support for the ASCII character set , e.g . no lowercase letters , which also hampered business adoption . An extensive line of upgrades and add-on hardware peripherals for the TRS-80 was developed and marketed by Tandy/RadioShack . The basic system can be expanded with up to 48 KB of RAM ( in 16 KB increments ) , and up to four floppy disk drives and/or hard disk drives . Tandy/RadioShack provided full-service support including upgrade , repair , and training services in their thousands of stores worldwide . By 1979 , the TRS-80 had the largest selection of software in the microcomputer market .",
  "/wiki/TRS-80_MC-10": "The TRS-80 MC-10 microcomputer is a lesser-known member of the TRS-80 line of home computers , produced by Tandy Corporation in the early 1980s and sold through their RadioShack chain of electronics stores . It was apparently designed as a low-cost alternative to Tandy 's own TRS-80 Color Computer to compete with entry-level machines that had previously dominated the market , such as the Commodore VIC-20 and Sinclair ZX81 . Due to its limited feature set , the MC-10 was of value primarily to hobbyists and as an introduction to computer programming . It was not a commercial success and was discontinued only a year after its introduction . A clone of the MC-10 , the Alice , was marketed in France through a collaboration among Tandy , Matra and Hachette .",
  "/wiki/Matra_Alice": "The Matra & Hachette Ordinateur Alice is a home computer sold in France beginning in 1983 . It was a clone of the TRS-80 MC-10 , produced through a collaboration between Matra and Hachette in France and Tandy Corporation in the United States .",
  "/wiki/Freeware": "Freeware is software , most often proprietary , that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user . There is no agreed-upon set of rights , license , or EULA that defines freeware unambiguously ; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers . For instance , modification , redistribution by third parties , and reverse engineering without the author 's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others . Unlike with free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge , the source code for freeware is typically not made available . Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by , for example , encouraging sales of a more capable version , as in the freemium and shareware business models .",
  "/wiki/Dragon_32/64": "The Dragon 32 and Dragon 64 are home computers that were built in the 1980s . The Dragons are very similar to the TRS-80 Color Computer , and were produced for the European market by Dragon Data , Ltd. , in Port Talbot , Wales ( until 1984 ) and by Eurohard S.A. in Casar de C\u00e1ceres , Spain ( from 1984 to 1987 ) , and for the US market by Tano of New Orleans , Louisiana . The model numbers reflect the primary difference between the two machines , which have 32 and 64 kilobytes ( 32,768 and 65,536 bytes ) of RAM , respectively .",
  "/wiki/Unix": "Unix ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u026aks/ ; trademarked as UNIX ) is a family of multitasking , multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT & T Unix , development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , and others . Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows . Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system : almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language , thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms ."
