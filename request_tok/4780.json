  "/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead": "The Day of the Dead ( Spanish : D\u00eda de Muertos ) is a Mexican holiday celebrated throughout Mexico , in particular the Central and South regions , and by people of Mexican heritage elsewhere . The multi-day holiday involves family and friends gathering to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died , and helping support their spiritual journey . In Mexican culture , death is viewed as a natural part of the human cycle . Mexicans view it not as a day of sadness but as a day of celebration because their loved ones awake and celebrate with them . In 2008 , the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO . The holiday is sometimes called D\u00eda de los Muertos in Anglophone countries , a back-translation of its original Mexican name , D\u00eda de Muertos . It is particularly celebrated in Mexico where the day is a public holiday . Prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century , the celebration took place at the beginning of summer . Gradually , it was associated with October 31 , November 1 , and November 2 to coincide with the Western Christian triduum of Allhallowtide : All Saints ' Eve , All Saints ' Day , and All Souls ' Day . Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called ofrendas , honoring the deceased using calaveras , aztec marigolds , and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed , and visiting graves with these as gifts . Visitors also leave possessions of the deceased at the graves . Scholars trace the origins of the modern Mexican holiday to indigenous observances dating back hundreds of years and to an Aztec festival dedicated to the goddess Mictecacihuatl .",
