It is bordered by Rwanda to the north , Tanzania to the east and southeast , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west ; Lake Tanganyika lies along its southwestern border . The capital is Bujumbura . The Twa , Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years . For more than 200 of those years , Burundi was an independent kingdom , until the beginning of the 20th century , when Germany colonised the region . After the First World War and Germany 's defeat , it ceded the territory to Belgium . Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi . Despite common misconceptions , Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation . Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy , but a series of assassinations , coups and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966 . Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the economy undeveloped and the population as one of the world 's poorest . The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi , both Hutus , died together when their aeroplane was shot down in April 1994 . 2015 witnessed large-scale political strife as President Pierre Nkurunziza opted to run for a third term in office , a coup attempt failed and the country 's parliamentary and presidential elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community .",

  "/wiki/Weimar_Republic": "The Weimar Republic ( German : Weimarer Republik [ \u02c8va\u026ama\u0281\u0250 \u0281epu\u02c8bli\u02d0k ] ( listen ) ) is an unofficial historical designation for the German state from 1918 to 1933 . The name derives from the city of Weimar , where its constitutional assembly first took place . The official name of the republic remained Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) unchanged from 1871 , because of the German tradition of substates . Although commonly translated as German Empire , the word Reich here better translates as realm , in that the term does not necessarily have monarchical connotations in itself . The Reich was changed from a constitutional monarchy into a republic . In English , the country was usually known simply as Germany . Germany became a de facto republic on 9 November 1918 when Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son Crown Prince Wilhelm , and became a de jure republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created . A national assembly was convened in Weimar , where a new constitution for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919 . In its fourteen years , the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems , including hyperinflation , political extremism ( with contending paramilitaries ) as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War . Resentment in Germany towards the Treaty of Versailles was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty . The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations ( by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan ) . Under the Locarno Treaties , Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning irredentist claims on France and Belgium , but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade Austria to join Germany as one of Germany 's states .",
  "/wiki/Nazi_Germany": "Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945 , when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) controlled the country through a dictatorship . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law . The government was not a coordinated , co-operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour . In the midst of the Great Depression , the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy .",
  "/wiki/Highway_of_Tears_murders": "The Highway of Tears is a 725-kilometre ( 450 mi ) corridor of Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert , British Columbia , Canada , which has been the location of many murders and disappearances beginning in 1970 . The phrase was coined in 1998 during a vigil held in Terrace , British Columbia for four murdered and two missing women . There are a disproportionately high number of Indigenous women on the list of victims . Proposed explanations for the years-long endurance of the crimes and the limited progress in identifying culprits include systemic racism , poverty , drug abuse , widespread domestic violence , disconnection with traditional culture and disruption of the family unit through the foster care system and Canadian Indian residential school system . Poverty in particular leads to low rates of car ownership and mobility , thus hitchhiking is often the only way for many to travel vast distances to see family or go to work , school , or seek medical treatment . Another factor leading to abductions and murders is that the area is largely isolated and remote , with soft soil in many areas and carnivorous scavengers to carry away human remains ; these factors precipitate violent attacks as perpetrators feel a sense of impunity , privacy and the ability to easily carry out their crimes and hide evidence .",

Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/Serial_confessor": "A false confession is an admission of guilt for a crime for which the confessor is not responsible . False confessions can be induced through coercion or by the mental disorder or incompetency of the accused . Research has demonstrated that false confessions occur on a regular basis in case law . Juveniles have a significantly higher rate of false confessions than do adults . This is one reason why jurisprudence has established a series of rules - called confession rules - to detect , and subsequently reject , false confessions . Plea agreements typically require the defendant to stipulate to a set of facts establishing that he/she is guilty of the offense . For example , in the United States federal system , before the court enters judgment on a guilty plea , it must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea .",

Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest .

From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",
  "/wiki/Jackal": "Jackals are medium-sized omnivorous mammals of the genus Canis , which also includes wolves and the domestic dog .

Jackals and coyotes ( sometimes called the American jackal ) are opportunistic omnivores , predators of small to medium-sized animals and proficient scavengers . Their long legs and curved canine teeth are adapted for hunting small mammals , birds , and reptiles , and their large feet and fused leg bones give them a physique well-suited for long-distance running , capable of maintaining speeds of 16 km/h ( 9.9 mph ) for extended periods of time . Jackals are crepuscular , most active at dawn and dusk . Their most common social unit is a monogamous pair , which defends its territory from other pairs by vigorously chasing intruding rivals and marking landmarks around the territory with their urine and feces . The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults , which stay with their parents until they establish their own territories . Jackals may occasionally assemble in small packs , for example , to scavenge a carcass , but they normally hunt either alone or in pairs . [ citation needed ]",

This was followed by another investigation in 2009 . The investigation was discontinued due to the stonewalling of the local government under Theresa and the lack of public outrage . The Office of the Ombudsman closed an investigation in October 2019 stating that they found no evidence that the Davao Death Squad exists , and no evidence to connect the police or Duterte with the killings .",
  "/wiki/John_Bodkin_Adams": "John Bodkin Adams ( 21 January 1899 - 4 July 1983 ) was a British general practitioner , convicted fraudster and suspected serial killer . Between 1946 and 1956 , 163 of his patients probably died while in a coma , so deemed to be worthy of investigation . In addition , 132 out of 310 patients had left Adams money or items in their wills . He was tried and acquitted for the murder of one patient in 1957 . Another count of murder was withdrawn by the prosecution in what was later described as an abuse of process by the presiding judge Sir Patrick Devlin , causing questions to be asked in Parliament about the prosecution 's handling of events . The trial was featured in headlines around the world and was described at the time as one of the greatest murder trials of all time and murder trial of the century . It was also described at the time as unique because , in the words of the judge , the act of murder had to be proved by expert evidence . The trial had several important legal ramifications . It established the doctrine of double effect , whereby a doctor giving treatment with the aim of relieving pain may lawfully , as an unintentional result , shorten life . Secondly , because of the publicity surrounding Adams ' committal hearing , the law was changed to allow defendants to ask for such hearings to be held in private . Finally , although a defendant had not been required within recorded legal history to give evidence in his own defence , the judge underlined in his summing-up that no prejudice should be attached by the jury to Adams not doing so . Adams was found guilty in a subsequent trial of 13 offences of prescription fraud , lying on cremation forms , obstructing a police search and failing to keep a dangerous drugs register .",

  "/wiki/Smiley_face_murder_theory": "The Smiley face murder theory ( variations include Smiley face murders , Smiley face killings , Smiley face gang , and others ) is a theory advanced by retired New York City detectives Kevin Gannon and Anthony Duarte , and Dr. Lee Gilbertson , a criminal justice professor and gang expert at St . Cloud State University . They allege that a number of young men found dead in bodies of water across several Midwestern American states from the late-1990s to the 2010s did not accidentally drown , as concluded by law enforcement agencies , but were victims of a serial killer or killers . The term smiley face became connected to the alleged murders when it was made public that the police had discovered graffiti depicting a smiley face near locations where they think the killer dumped the bodies in at least a dozen of the cases . Gannon wrote a textbook case study on the subject titled , Case Studies in Drowning Forensics . The response of law enforcement investigators and other experts has been largely skeptical .",
