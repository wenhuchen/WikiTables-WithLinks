  "section_text": "C-40A . C-20 . C-130 . The VR designator was first established in 1942 to designated `` Transport '' or `` Air Transport '' or Fleet Logistic Air '' squadrons . From 1958 to 1976 it designated `` Fleet Tactical Support Squadron '' and from 1976 to the present it designates `` Fleet Logistics Support Squadron '' . Today all Fleet Logistics Support squadrons are U. S. Navy Reserve squadrons Fleet Logistics Support Squadrons operate Navy Unique Fleet Essential Airlift ( NUFEA ) aircraft on a worldwide basis to provide responsive , flexible , and rapidly deployable air logistics support required to sustain combat operations from the sea . During peacetime , squadrons provide air logistics support for all Navy commands as well as provide continuous quality training for mobilization readiness . Fleet Logistics Support squadrons have no counterpart in the Regular Navy . They represent 100% of the Navy 's medium and heavy intra-theater airlift , and operate year-round , around the world providing the critical link between deployed seagoing units and air mobility command logistics hubs . VR-1 provides dedicated airlift support to the Office of the Secretary of the Navy , Chief of Naval Operations and Commandant of the Marine Corps . The Headquarters of the Fleet Logistics Support Wing is based at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth , TX but the squadrons of the wing are based across the country from the east coast to Hawaii . In addition to the VR squadrons , the Fleet Logistics Support Wing also operates two `` Executive Transport Detachments ( ETDs ) '' based in Hawaii and Sigonella Italy .",

  "intro": "This is a list of active United States Navy aircraft squadrons. Deactivated or disestablished squadrons are listed in the List of Inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons. Navy aircraft squadrons are composed of several aircraft (from as few as about four to as many as about a dozen), the officers who fly them, the officers and sailors who maintain them and administrative support officers and sailors. Some of the units listed in this article are not technically squadrons, but they all operate U.S. Navy aircraft in some capacity. Squadrons and their history are listed in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons (DANAS)."
