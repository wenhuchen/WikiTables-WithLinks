The film was directed by Jay Levey , Yankovic 's manager , who also co-wrote the screenplay with him . The film was originally released by Orion Pictures and is currently owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . Yankovic stars as George Newman , a shiftless dreamer who stumbles into managing a low-budget television station and , surprisingly , finds success with his eclectic programming choices , spearheaded by the antics of a janitor-turned-children 's television host , Stanley Spadowski ( Richards ) . He provokes the ire of a major network station that dislikes the competitive upstart . The title refers to the Ultra High Frequency ( UHF ) analog television broadcasting band on which such low-budget television stations often were placed in the United States . Yankovic and Levey wrote the film after Yankovic 's second studio album , looking to apply the musician 's parody and comedy to film , and chose the approach of George being a straight man with a vivid imagination to support the inclusion of parodies within the film . They struggled with finding a film production company for financing the film , but were eventually able to get Orion Pictures ' support after stating they could keep the film costs under $ 5 million . Principal filming took place around Tulsa , Oklahoma , with many of the extras for the film from the Tulsa and Dallas , Texas areas . UHF earned mixed critical reviews , and was further impacted by being released in the middle of one of Hollywood 's largest blockbuster summer periods . While only a modest success during its theatrical release , it became a cult film on home video and cable TV . Shout !",
