  "/wiki/Emperor_penguin": "The emperor penguin ( Aptenodytes forsteri ) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica . The male and female are similar in plumage and size , reaching 122 cm ( 48 in ) in length and weighing from 22 to 45 kg ( 49 to 99 lb ) . Feathers of the head and back are black and sharply delineated from the white belly , pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches . Like all penguins it is flightless , with a streamlined body , and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat . Its diet consists primarily of fish , but also includes crustaceans , such as krill , and cephalopods , such as squid . While hunting , the species can remain submerged around 20 minutes , diving to a depth of 535 m ( 1,755 ft ) . It has several adaptations to facilitate this , including an unusually structured haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels , solid bones to reduce barotrauma , and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions . The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter , emperor penguins trek 50-120 km ( 31-75 mi ) over the ice to breeding colonies which can contain up to several thousand individuals . The female lays a single egg , which is incubated for just over two months by the male while the female returns to the sea to feed ; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony . The lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild , although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50 years of age .",

  "/wiki/Minke_whale": "The minke whale /\u02c8m\u026anki/ , or lesser rorqual , is a species complex of baleen whale . The two species of minke whale are the common ( or northern ) minke whale and the Antarctic ( or southern ) minke whale . The minke whale was first described by the Danish naturalist Otto Fabricius in 1780 , who assumed it must be an already known species and assigned his specimen to Balaena rostrata , a name given to the northern bottlenose whale by Otto Friedrich M\u00fcller in 1776 . In 1804 , Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de described a juvenile specimen of Balaenoptera acuto-rostrata . The name is a partial translation of Norwegian minkehval , possibly after a Norwegian whaler named Meincke , who mistook a northern minke whale for a blue whale .",

  "/wiki/Antarctic_minke_whale": "The Antarctic minke whale or southern minke whale ( Balaenoptera bonaerensis ) is a species of minke whale within the suborder of baleen whales . It is the second smallest rorqual after the common minke whale and the third smallest baleen whale . Although first scientifically described in the mid-19th century , it was not recognized as a distinct species until the 1990s . Once ignored by the whaling industry due to its small size and low oil yield , the Antarctic minke was able to avoid the fate of other baleen whales and maintained a large population into the 21st century , numbering in the hundreds of thousands . Surviving to become the most abundant baleen whale in the world , it is now one of the mainstays of the industry alongside its cosmopolitan counterpart the common minke . It is primarily restricted to the Southern Hemisphere ( although vagrants have been reported in the North Atlantic ) and feeds mainly on euphausiids .",

  "/wiki/Blue_whale": "The blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus ) is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whale suborder Mysticeti . Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 meters ( 98 feet ) and weight of 177 tonnes ( 190 tons ) , it is the largest animal known to have ever existed . The blue whales long and slender body can be various shades of grayish-blue dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath . There are currently five subspecies of blue whale , recognized by the Society for Marine Mammalogy 's Committee on Taxonomy : B. m. musculus in the North Atlantic and North Pacific , B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean , B. m. brevicauda ( the pygmy blue whale ) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean , B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean , and B. m. unnamed subsp . in the waters off Chile . The blue whale diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids ( krill ) . Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the end of the 19th century . They were hunted almost to extinction by whaling until the International Whaling Commission banned all hunting of blue whales in 1967 . The International Whaling Commission catch database estimates that 382,595 blue whales were caught between 1868 and 1978 . The global blue whale population abundance is estimated to be 10,000-25,000 blue whales , roughly 3-11% of the population size estimated in 1911 . There remain only much smaller concentrations in the Eastern North Pacific ( 1,647 ) , Central North Pacific ( 63-133 ) , North Atlantic ( 1000-2,000 ) , Antarctic ( 2,280 ) , New Zealand ( 718 ) , Northern Indian Ocean ( 270 ) , and Chile ( 570-760 ) .",

  "/wiki/Crabeater_seal": "The crabeater seal ( Lobodon carcinophaga ) , also known as the krill-eater seal , is a true seal with a circumpolar distribution around the coast of Antarctica . They are medium- to large-sized ( over 2 m in length ) , relatively slender and pale-colored , found primarily on the free-floating pack ice that extends seasonally out from the Antarctic coast , which they use as a platform for resting , mating , social aggregation and accessing their prey . They are by far the most abundant seal species in the world . While population estimates are uncertain , there are at least 7 million and possibly as many as 75 million individuals . This success of this species is due to its specialized predation on the abundant Antarctic krill of the Southern Ocean , for which it has uniquely adapted , sieve-like tooth structure . Indeed , its scientific name , translated as lobe-toothed ( lobodon ) crab eater ( carcinophaga ) , refers specifically to the finely lobed teeth adapted to filtering their small crustacean prey . Despite its name , crabeater seals do not eat crabs . As well as being an important krill predator , the crabeater seal is an important component of the diet of leopard seals ( Hydrurga leptonyx ) , which are responsible for 80% of all crabeater pups deaths .

  "/wiki/Killer_whale": "The killer whale or orca ( Orcinus orca ) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family , of which it is the largest member . Killer whales have a diverse diet , although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey . Some feed exclusively on fish , while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin . They have been known to attack baleen whale calves , and even adult whales . Killer whales are apex predators , as no animal preys on them . A cosmopolitan species , they can be found in each of the world 's oceans in a variety of marine environments , from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas , absent only from the Baltic and Black seas , and some areas of the Arctic Ocean . Killer whales are highly social ; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups ( pods ) which are the most stable of any animal species . Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours , which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations , have been described as manifestations of animal culture . The International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses the orca 's conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species . Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion , habitat loss , pollution ( by PCBs ) , capture for marine mammal parks , and conflicts with human fisheries . In late 2005 , the southern resident killer whales , which swim in British Columbia and Washington state waters , were placed on the U.S . Endangered Species list .",

  "/wiki/Shearwater": "Shearwaters are medium-sized long-winged seabirds . There are more than 30 species of shearwaters , a few larger ones in the genus Calonectris and many smaller species in the genus Puffinus . The Procellaria petrels and Bulweria were believed to belong to this group , but are only distantly related based on more recent studies , while the Pseudobulweria and Lugensa petrels are more closely related . The genus Puffinus can be divided into a group of small species close to Calonectris and a few larger ones more distantly related to both . These birds are most common in temperate and cold waters . They are pelagic outside the breeding season . These tubenose birds fly with stiff wings and use a shearing flight technique ( flying very close to the water and seemingly cutting or shearing the tips of waves ) to move across wave fronts with the minimum of active flight . This technique gives the group its English name . Some small species , like the Manx shearwater are cruciform in flight , with their long wings held directly out from their bodies . Many are long-distance migrants , perhaps most spectacularly sooty shearwaters , which cover distances in excess of 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) from their breeding colony on the Falkland Islands ( 52\u00b0S 60\u00b0W ) to as far as 70\u00b0 north latitude in the North Atlantic Ocean off northern Norway . One study found Sooty shearwaters migrating nearly 40,000 miles ( 64,000 kilometers ) a year , which would give them the longest animal migration ever recorded electronically . Short-tailed shearwaters perform an even longer figure of eight loop migration in the Pacific Ocean from Tasmania to as far north as the Arctic Ocean off northwest Alaska .",
