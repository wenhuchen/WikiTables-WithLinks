  "/wiki/Ombudsman": "An ombudsman ( /\u02c8\u0252mb\u028adzm\u0259n/ , also US : /-b\u0259dz- , -b\u028cdz-/ , Swedish : [ \u02c8\u0254\u0302m\u02d0b\u0289\u02d0ds\u02ccman ] ) , ombudsperson , ombud , or public advocate is an official who is charged with representing the interests of the public by investigating and addressing complaints of mal-administration or a violation of rights . The ombudsman is usually appointed by the government or by parliament but with a significant degree of independence . In some countries , an inspector general , citizen advocate or other official may have duties similar to those of a national ombudsman and may also be appointed by a legislature . Below the national level , an ombudsman may be appointed by a state , local , or municipal government . Unofficial ombudsmen may be appointed by , or even work for , a corporation such as a utility supplier , newspaper , NGO , or professional regulatory body . The typical duties of an ombudsman are to investigate complaints and attempt to resolve them , usually through recommendations ( binding or not ) or mediation . Ombudsmen sometimes also aim to identify systemic issues leading to poor service or breaches of people 's rights . At the national level , most ombudsmen have a wide mandate to deal with the entire public sector , and sometimes also elements of the private sector ( for example , contracted service providers ) . In some cases , there is a more restricted mandate , for example with particular sectors of society . More recent developments have included the creation of specialized Children 's Ombudsman and Information Commissioner agencies . In some jurisdictions an ombudsman charged with handling concerns about national government is more formally referred to as the Parliamentary Commissioner ( e.g . the United Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration , and the Western Australian state Ombudsman ) .",

Taylor , circa 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings , including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves . The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 .

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",
