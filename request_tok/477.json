  "/wiki/Ice_hockey": "Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice , usually in a rink , in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent 's net to score goals . The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical , with teams usually fielding six players at a time : one goaltender , and five players who skate the span of the ice trying to control the puck and score goals against the opposing team .

In addition , ice hockey is the most popular winter sport in Belarus , Croatia , the Czech Republic , Finland , Latvia , Russia , Slovakia , Sweden , and Switzerland . North America 's National Hockey League ( NHL ) is the highest level for men 's ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world .

  "/wiki/Indoor_soccer": "Indoor soccer or arena soccer ( known internationally as indoor football , minifootball , fast football , floorball or showball ) , is a game derived from association football adapted for play in a walled indoor arena . Indoor soccer , as it is most often known in the United States and Canada , was originally developed in these two countries as a way to play soccer during the winter months , when snow would make outdoor play difficult . In those countries , gymnasiums are adapted for indoor soccer play . In other countries the game is played in either indoor or outdoor arenas surrounded by walls , and is referred to by different names ( such as fast football ( futbol rapido ) in Mexico , showbol in South America , and indoor football ( futbol indoor ) in Spain ) . Indoor soccer has different regulations from other versions of association football designed for indoor play , such as futsal and five-a-side football . Unlike futsal , which is played on wooden or ceramic surfaces , indoor soccer is played on synthetic turf ( or , in the case of the British Masters Football variety , synthetic carpet ) . Indoor soccer courts are either delimited by walls or lines , and there are no player throw-ins . FIFA , the international body that oversees international association football competitions , does not sanction the synthetic turf version of indoor soccer , having developed its own code of indoor football ( which they refer to as futsal ) . Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States , Canada , and Mexico , with several amateur , collegiate and professional leagues functioning . While internationally less popular than futsal , indoor soccer is also played at the league level in many countries outside North America . The World Minifootball Federation ( WMF ) is the governing body of indoor soccer at the international level , having replaced the International Fast Football Federation ( FIFRA ) . The term minifootball , which was originally coined in Europe , has been adopted by the WMF as a standard international name for the sport .",
  "/wiki/Arena_football": "Arena football is a variety of eight-man gridiron football . The game is played indoors on a smaller field than American or Canadian football , designed to fit in the same surface area as a standard North American ice hockey rink , resulting in a faster and higher-scoring game that can be played on the floors of indoor arenas . The sport was invented in 1981 , and patented in 1987 , by Jim Foster , a former executive of the National Football League and the United States Football League . The name is trademarked by Gridiron Enterprises and had a proprietary format until its patent expired in 2007 . Three leagues have played under arena football rules : the Arena Football League , which played 32 seasons in two separate runs from 1987 to 2008 and 2010 to 2019 ; arenafootball2 , the AFL 's erstwhile developmental league , which played 10 seasons from 2000 through 2009 ; and the China Arena Football League , which began play in 2016 but is not directly affiliated with the AFL . The CAFL , which operates on a heavily abbreviated schedule solely in China , is the only currently active league playing by arena rules . Through the late 1990s , the Arena Football League was the only league playing any variant of the sport designed for indoor play . A clarification limiting the scope of its patent allowed for competing indoor American football leagues to use the same size field and most other aspects of the game . Arena football is distinguished from the other indoor leagues by its use of large rebound nets attached to the side of each goalpost , which keep any missed field goal or overthrown ball in the field of play and allow the ball to remain live ; the rebound nets were the only part of the patent that was upheld until it expired .",
