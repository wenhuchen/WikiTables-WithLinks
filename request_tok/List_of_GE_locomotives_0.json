  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",

  "/wiki/GE_44-ton_switcher": "The GE 44-ton switcher is a 4-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by General Electric between 1940 and 1956 . It was designed for industrial and light switching duties , often replacing steam locomotives that had previously been assigned these chores . This locomotive 's specific 44-short ton weight was directly related to one of the efficiencies the new diesel locomotives offered compared to their steam counterparts : reduced labor intensity . In the 1940s , the steam to diesel transition was in its infancy in North America , and railroad unions were trying to protect the locomotive fireman jobs that were redundant with diesel units . One measure taken to this end was the 1937 so-called 90,000 Pound Rule : [ citation needed ] a stipulation that locomotives weighing 90,000 pounds ( 41,000 kg ) - 45 short tons - or more required a fireman in addition to an engineer on common carrier railroads . Industrial and military railroads had no such stipulation . The 44-ton locomotive was born to skirt this requirement . Other manufacturers also built 44-ton switchers of center-cab configuration . 276 examples of this locomotive were built for U. S. railroads and industrial concerns , four were exported to Australia in 1944 , 10 were exported to Canada , 10 were exported to Cuba , one was exported to the Dominican Republic , five were exported to France , three were exported to India , six were exported to Mexico , five were exported to Saudi Arabia , one was exported to Sweden , two were exported to Trinidad , 10 were exported to Uruguay , and 57 were built for the U. S. Military . Many remain , in service and in museums .",

  "/wiki/GE_boxcab": "The GE boxcabs , sometimes also GE IR boxcabs , were diesel-electric switcher locomotives succeeding the ALCO boxcabs . The locomotives were built by General Electric and Ingersoll Rand without ALCO . Production lasted from 1928 till 1930 . These boxcabs were often termed oil-electrics to avoid the use of the German name Diesel , unpopular after World War I ."
