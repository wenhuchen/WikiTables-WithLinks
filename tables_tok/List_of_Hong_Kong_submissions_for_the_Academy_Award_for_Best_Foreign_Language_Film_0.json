  "intro": "Hong Kong has submitted 36 films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film[nb 1] since first entering the Oscar competition in 1959. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Hong Kong's submission is decided annually by Hong Kong's Motion Picture Industry Association. China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are recognized as separate entities by AMPAS and each one routinely sends a film to the competition. Two Hong Kong submissions have been selected as Oscar nominees, both of these films were directed by Mainland-directors. Although one of the hallmarks of Hong Kong Cinema has been its use of the distinctive Cantonese language, less than half of Hong Kong's Oscar submissions have been in Cantonese. Although The Departed was awarded the Oscar for Best Picture in 2007, the HK movie it was based on, Infernal Affairs, did not manage an Oscar nomination. Johnnie To and Han Hsiang Li have had their films selected three times while Yueh Feng, Wai Ka-Fai, King Hu, Ann Hui and Yim Ho have each been selected twice. Hong Kong's most internationally famous director, Wong Kar-wai has been selected by Hong Kong twice, in 2000 and 2013 (The Grandmaster). In 2002 and 2004, Hong Kong's submissions were rejected by the Academy for not conforming to AMPAS rules."
