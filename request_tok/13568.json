The costumes range from sentai style suits , to kimono , to rubber Playmobil style wigs . There is also a tiger costume and a giant squid/guitar costume to coincide with the song Mad Tiger . Another aspect of their routine is their on-stage antics such as human bowling ( diving head-first into bowling pins ) , pretending to hit each other with chairs in imitation of pro-wrestlers , and mid-performance piggyback rides . They often allow audience members on stage to join in on the fun , and often dive into the audience or hang from a balcony as part of their act . In 1999 the band released a mini album on Eat Rice Records . The band was also featured on an episode of the Upright Citizens Brigade on Comedy Central .
