  "/wiki/Dive_Coaster": "The Dive Coaster is a steel roller coaster model developed and engineered by Bolliger & Mabillard . The design features one or more near-vertical drops that are approximately 90 degrees , which provide a moment of free-falling for passengers . The experience is enhanced by unique trains that seat up to ten riders per row , spanning only two or three rows total . Unlike traditional train design , this distinguishing aspect gives all passengers virtually the same experience throughout the course of the ride . Another defining characteristic of Dive Coasters is the holding brake at the top of the lift hill that stops the train momentarily right as it enters the first drop , suspending some passengers with a view looking straight down and releasing suddenly moments later . Development of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995 with Oblivion at Alton Towers opening on March 14 , 1998 , making it the world 's first Dive Coaster . The trains for this type of coaster are relatively short consisting of two to three cars . B & M also uses floorless trains on this model to enhance the experience . As of May 2019 , fourteen Dive Coasters have been built , with the newest being Yukon Striker at Canada 's Wonderland . Featuring a height of 68 metres ( 223 ft ) , a length of 1,105 metres ( 3,625 ft ) , and a maximum speed of 130 km/h ( 81 mph ) , Yukon Striker is the world 's tallest , longest , and fastest Dive Coaster .",
