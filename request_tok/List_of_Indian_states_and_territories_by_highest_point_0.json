The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century , but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories . The bulk of western and central Tibet ( \u00dc-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations ; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship . Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing , with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders . The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure , being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups , while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo ; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai . The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century . Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912 , Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area ( \u00dc-Tsang ) . The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . Later , Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China .",
