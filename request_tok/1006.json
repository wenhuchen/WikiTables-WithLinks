  "/wiki/Frank_Friday_Fletcher": "Frank Friday Fletcher ( November 23 , 1855 - November 28 , 1928 ) was a United States Navy admiral who served in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . He was awarded the U.S. military 's highest decoration , the Medal of Honor , for his actions as commander of navy forces at the Battle of Veracruz , Mexico .

  "/wiki/Fletcher-class_destroyer": "The Fletcher class was a class of destroyers built by the United States during World War II . The class was designed in 1939 , as a result of dissatisfaction with the earlier destroyer leader types of the Porter and Somers classes . Some went on to serve during the Korean War and into the Vietnam War . The United States Navy commissioned 175 Fletcher-class destroyers between 1942 and 1944 , more than any other destroyer class , and the design was generally regarded as highly successful . Fletchers had a design speed of 38 knots and an armament of five 5 guns in single mounts with 10 21 torpedoes in two quintuple centerline mounts . The Allen M. Sumner and Gearing classes were Fletcher derivatives . The long-range Fletcher-class ships performed every task asked of a destroyer , from anti-submarine warfare and anti-aircraft warfare to surface action . They could cover the vast distances required by fleet actions in the Pacific and served almost exclusively in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II , during which they accounted for 29 Imperial Japanese Navy submarines sunk . [ failed verification ] In a massive effort , the Fletchers were built by shipyards across the United States and , after World War II ended , 11 were sold to countries that they had been built to fight against : Italy , Germany , and Japan , as well as other countries , where they had even longer , distinguished careers . Three have been preserved as museum ships in the U.S. and one in Greece .",

  "/wiki/USS_New_Hampshire_(BB-25)": "New Hampshire ( BB-25 ) was the sixth and final Connecticut-class pre-dreadnought battleship , the last vessel of that type built for the United States Navy . Like most contemporary battleships , she was armed with an offensive armament that consisted of four large-caliber 12-inch ( 300 mm ) guns and several medium-caliber 7 and 8-inch ( 178 and 203 mm ) guns . The ship was laid down in May 1905 , launched in June 1906 , and commissioned in March 1908 , a little over a year after the revolutionary all-big-gun HMS Dreadnought rendered ships like New Hampshire obsolescent . Despite being rapidly surpassed by new American dreadnoughts , New Hampshire had an active career . She made two trips to Europe in 1910 and 1911 , and she sank the old battleship USS Texas , which had been converted into a target ship . New Hampshire was particularly active in the Caribbean during this period , as several countries , including Haiti , the Dominican Republic , and Mexico devolved into internal political conflicts . These actions included the United States occupation of Veracruz , during which the ship 's commander was awarded the Medal of Honor . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , the ship was used primarily to train gunners and engine room personnel , as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign . She escorted convoys in late 1918 , and after the war ended she took part in the effort to bring American soldiers back from France . New Hampshire remained in service for only a few years after the war , as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty significantly reduced the navies of the signatories ; as a result , the ship was sold for scrap in November 1923 .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea": "The Battle of the Coral Sea , fought from 4-8 May 1942 , was a major naval battle between the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) and naval and air forces from the United States and Australia , taking place in the Pacific Theatre of World War II . The battle is historically significant as the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other , as well as the first in which the opposing ships neither sighted nor fired directly upon one another . In an attempt to strengthen their defensive position in the South Pacific , the Japanese decided to invade and occupy Port Moresby ( in New Guinea ) and Tulagi ( in the southeastern Solomon Islands ) . The plan to accomplish this was called Operation Mo , and involved several major units of Japan 's Combined Fleet . These included two fleet carriers and a light carrier to provide air cover for the invasion forces . It was under the overall command of Japanese Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue . The U.S. learned of the Japanese plan through signals intelligence , and sent two United States Navy carrier task forces and a joint Australian-U.S. cruiser force to oppose the offensive . These were under the overall command of U.S. Admiral Frank J. Fletcher . On 3-4 May , Japanese forces successfully invaded and occupied Tulagi , although several of their supporting warships were sunk or damaged in surprise attacks by aircraft from the U.S. fleet carrier Yorktown . Now aware of the presence of U.S. carriers in the area , the Japanese fleet carriers advanced towards the Coral Sea with the intention of locating and destroying the Allied naval forces . On the evening of 6 May , the direction chosen for air searches by the opposing commanders brought the two carrier forces to within 70 nmi ( 81 mi ; 130 km ) of each other , unbeknownst to both sides . Beginning on 7 May , the carrier forces from the two sides engaged in airstrikes over two consecutive days .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Midway": "The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II that took place on 4-7 June 1942 , six months after Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea . The United States Navy under Admirals Chester W. Nimitz , Frank J. Fletcher , and Raymond A. Spruance defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto , Ch\u016bichi Nagumo , and Nobutake Kond\u014d near Midway Atoll , inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable . Military historian John Keegan called it the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare , while naval historian Craig Symonds called it one of the most consequential naval engagements in world history , ranking alongside Salamis , Trafalgar , and Tsushima Strait , as both tactically decisive and strategically influential . The Japanese operation , like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor , sought to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific , thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . The Japanese hoped another demoralizing defeat would force the U.S. to capitulate in the Pacific War and thus ensure Japanese dominance in the Pacific . Luring the American aircraft carriers into a trap and occupying Midway was part of an overall barrier strategy to extend Japan 's defensive perimeter , in response to the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo . This operation was also considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji , Samoa , and Hawaii itself . The plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of the American reaction and poor initial dispositions . Most significantly , American cryptographers were able to determine the date and location of the planned attack , enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to prepare its own ambush . Four Japanese and three American aircraft carriers participated in the battle . The four Japanese fleet carriers - Akagi , Kaga , S\u014dry\u016b and Hiry\u016b , part of the six-carrier force that had attacked Pearl Harbor six months earlier - were sunk , as was the heavy cruiser Mikuma . The U.S. lost the carrier Yorktown and the destroyer Hammann .",
