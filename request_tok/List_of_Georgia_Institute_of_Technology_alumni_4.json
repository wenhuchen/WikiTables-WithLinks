He became president of the city Chamber of Commerce in 1961 and during this same year ran for mayor , defeating the staunch segregationist , Lester Maddox .

On his first day in office , he ordered the removal of all white and colored signs from facilities in city hall . Racial alliances forged by Allen with Martin Luther King Jr. and others in the African American community , along with his advocacy for the public accommodation of African Americans in the white community , allowed Allen to guide Atlanta through the turbulence of racial integration without the violence that occurred in many southern cities . In a key address to the public , he asked Atlantans to eliminate racial segregation and in doing so , to set an example to inspire all the world .",

  "/wiki/Reconstruction_era_in_the_United_States": "The Reconstruction era was the period in American history which lasted from 1863 to 1877 . It was a significant chapter in the history of American civil rights . The term has two applications : the first applies to the complete history of the entire country from 1865 to 1877 following the American Civil War ; the second , to the attempted transformation of the 11 former Confederate states from 1863 to 1877 , as directed by Congress , and the role of the Union states in that transformation . Reconstruction ended the remnants of Confederate secession and abolished slavery , making the newly freed slaves citizens with civil rights ostensibly guaranteed by three new constitutional amendments . Three visions of Civil War memory appeared during Reconstruction : the reconciliationist vision , which was rooted in coping with the death and devastation the war had brought ; the white supremacist vision , which included segregation and the preservation of the traditional cultural standards of the South ; and the emancipationist vision , which sought full freedom , citizenship , and constitutional equality for African Americans . When President Abraham Lincoln , a Republican , was assassinated at the end of the Civil War , Vice President Andrew Johnson , a Democrat from Tennessee and former slave holder , became president . Johnson favored rapid measures to bring the South back into the Union , allowing the Southern states to determine the rights of former slaves . Radical Republicans in Congress sought stronger , federal measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans , including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , while curtailing the rights of former Confederates , such as through the provisions of the Wade-Davis Bill . Johnson , the most prominent Southerner to oppose the Confederacy , followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates . Lincoln 's last speeches show that he was leaning toward supporting the suffrage of all freedmen , whereas Johnson and the Democratic Party were strongly opposed to this . Johnson 's weak Reconstruction policies prevailed until the congressional elections of 1866 . Those elections followed outbreaks of violence against blacks in the former rebel states , including the Memphis riots of 1866 and the New Orleans massacre of 1866 ."
