At 8.5 million square kilometers ( 3.2 million square miles ) and with over 211 million people , Brazil is the world 's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous . Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic .

Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet .

Mandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups , spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area , stretching from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast . This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south , combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas . Most Mandarin varieties have four tones . The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties , but some have merged them as a final glottal stop .

The development of Mughal-e-Azam began in 1944 , when Asif read a play set in the reign of Emperor Akbar ( 1556-1605 ) . Production was plagued by delays and financial uncertainty . Before its principal photography began in the early 1950s , the project had lost a financier and undergone a complete change of cast . Mughal-e-Azam cost more to produce than any previous Indian motion picture ; the budget for a single song sequence exceeded that typical for an entire film of the period . The soundtrack , inspired by Indian classical and folk music , comprises 12 songs voiced by playback singer Lata Mangeshkar along with Mohammed Rafi , Shamshad Begum and classical singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , and is often cited among the finest in Bollywood cinematic history . Mughal-e-Azam had the widest release of any Indian film up to that time , and patrons often queued all day for tickets .

Modern Hindi is the standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language , which itself is based primarily on the Khariboli dialect of Delhi and other nearby areas of Northern India . Hindi , written in the Devanagari script , is one of the two official languages of the Government of India , along with the English language . It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India . Hindi is the lingua franca of the Hindi belt and to a lesser extent other parts of India ( usually in a simplified or pidginised variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi ) . Outside India , several other languages are recognised officially as Hindi but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language described here and instead descend from other dialects , such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri . Such languages include Fiji Hindi , which is official in Fiji , and Caribbean Hindustani , which is spoken in Trinidad and Tobago , Guyana , and Suriname . Apart from the script and formal vocabulary , spoken Hindi is mutually intelligible with standard Urdu , another recognised register of Hindustani as both share a common colloquial base . As a linguistic variety , Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world , after Mandarin , Spanish and English .

Urdu is the official national language , and lingua franca , of Pakistan . In India , it is one of 22 constitutionally recognised official languages , having official status in the five states of Telangana , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , as well as the national capital territory of Delhi . As both registers are composed of the same Indo-Aryan vocabulary base , colloquial Urdu is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi , with the two registers being grouped together as Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu . With respect to literary vocabulary , however , formal Urdu draws heavily from Persian vocabulary and requires knowledge of some simple Persian grammatical structures , while formal Hindi heavily draws from Sanskrit for its formal and technical vocabulary . Later , Urdu became the official language of government in northern and northwest British India , along with English , from 1837 onwards in place of Persian , which had been used by various Indo-Islamic empires as their language of government . Religious , social , and political factors arose during the colonial period that advocated for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi , leading to the Hindi-Urdu controversy . According to Nationalencyklopedin 's 2010 estimates , Urdu is the 21st most spoken first language in the world , with approximately 66 million who speak it as their native language . According to Ethnologue 's 2018 estimates , Urdu , is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world , with 170 million total speakers , including those who speak it as a second language .

The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people .

Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD .

It is a member of the Japonic ( or Japanese-Ryukyuan ) language family , and its relation to other languages , such as Korean , is debated . Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu , Austroasiatic , and the now-discredited Altaic , but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance . Little is known of the language 's prehistory , or when it first appeared in Japan . Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words , but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century . During the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) , Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese . Late Middle Japanese ( 1185-1600 ) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language , and the first appearance of European loanwords . The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo ( modern Tokyo ) region in the Early Modern Japanese period ( early 17th century-mid-19th century ) . Following the end of Japan 's self-imposed isolation in 1853 , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly . English loanwords , in particular , have become frequent , and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated . Japanese is an agglutinative , mora-timed language with simple phonotactics , a pure vowel system , phonemic vowel and consonant length , and a lexically significant pitch-accent . Word order is normally subject-object-verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words , and sentence structure is topic-comment .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas .

It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish , although the degree of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the dialect and accent of the speaker . Written Norwegian and Danish are usually more easily understood by Swedish speakers than the spoken languages , due to the differences in tone , accent and intonation . Swedish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . It has the most speakers of the North Germanic languages . Standard Swedish , spoken by most Swedes , is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century . While distinct regional varieties descending from the older rural dialects still exist , the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized . The standard word order is , as in most Germanic languages , V2 , which means that the finite verb ( V ) appears in the second position ( 2 ) of a declarative main clause . Swedish morphology is similar to English ; that is , words have comparatively few inflections . Swedish has two genders and is generally seen to have two grammatical cases - nominative and genitive ( except for pronouns that , as in English , also are inflected in the object form ) - although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive s , then seen as a clitic .

  "/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia": "The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) , also known as SFR Yugoslavia or simply Yugoslavia , was a country located in Central and Southeastern Europe that existed from its foundation in the aftermath of World War II until its dissolution in 1992 amid the Yugoslav Wars . Covering an area of 255,804 km\u00b2 ( 98,766 sq mi ) , the SFRY was bordered by the Adriatic Sea and Italy to the west , Austria and Hungary to the north , Bulgaria and Romania to the east , and Albania and Greece to the south . The nation was a socialist state and a federation governed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and made up of six socialist republics - Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , Montenegro , Serbia , and Slovenia - with Belgrade as its capital . In addition , it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia : Kosovo and Vojvodina . The SFRY 's origin is traced to 26 November 1942 , when the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia was formed during World War II . On 29 November 1945 , the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed after the deposition of King Peter II , thus ending the monarchy . Until 1948 , the new communist government originally sided with the Eastern Bloc under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito at the beginning of the Cold War , but after the Tito-Stalin split of 1948 , Yugoslavia pursued a policy of neutrality . It became one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement , and transitioned from a command economy to market-based socialism . The SFRY maintained neutrality during the Cold War as part of its foreign policy . It was a founding member of CERN , the United Nations , Non-Aligned Movement , OSCE , IFAD , WTO , Eutelsat , and BTWC . Following the death of Tito on 4 May 1980 , the Yugoslav economy started to collapse , which increased unemployment and inflation . The economic crisis led to a rise in ethnic nationalism in the late 1980s and early 1990s ; dissidence resulted among the multiple ethnicities within the constituent republics .",

It is a pluricentric language with four mutually intelligible standard varieties . South Slavic languages historically formed a continuum . The turbulent history of the area , particularly due to expansion of the Ottoman Empire , resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences . Due to population migrations , Shtokavian became the most widespread language in the western Balkans , intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by Chakavian and Kajkavian ( which further blend into Slovenian in the northwest ) . Bosniaks , Croats and Serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles , although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords . During that period , the language was referred to under a variety of names , such as Slavic in general or Serbian , Croatian or Bosnian in particular . In a classicizing manner , it was also referred to as Illyrian . The process of linguistic standardization of Serbo-Croatian was originally initiated in the mid-19th-century Vienna Literary Agreement by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists , decades before a Yugoslav state was established . From the very beginning , there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards , although both were based on the same dialect of Shtokavian , Eastern Herzegovinian . In the 20th century , Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ( when it was called Serbo-Croato-Slovenian ) , and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes , so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines .",
