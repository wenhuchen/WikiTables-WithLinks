  "/wiki/Fenchurch_Street_railway_station": "Fenchurch Street railway station , also known as London Fenchurch Street , is a central London railway terminus in the southeastern corner of the City of London . It takes its name from its proximity to Fenchurch Street , a key thoroughfare in the City . The station and all trains are operated by c2c . Services run on lines built by the London and Blackwall Railway ( L & BR ) and the London , Tilbury and Southend Railway ( LTSR ) to destinations in east London and south Essex , including Upminster , Grays , Basildon , Southend and Shoeburyness . The station opened in 1841 to serve the L & BR and was rebuilt in 1854 when the LTSR , a joint venture between the L & BR and the Eastern Counties Railway ( ECR ) , began operating . The ECR also operated trains out of Fenchurch Street to relieve congestion at its other London terminus at Bishopsgate . In 1862 the Great Eastern Railway was created by amalgamating various East Anglian railway companies ( including the ECR ) and it shared the station with the LTSR until 1912 , when the latter was bought by the Midland Railway . The station came under ownership of the London & North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) following the Railways Act 1921 , and was shared by LNER and London Midland & Scottish Railway ( LMS ) services until nationalisation in 1948 . The line from the station was electrified in 1961 , and controversially closed for seven weeks in 1994 . Fenchurch Street is one of the smallest railway terminals in London in terms of platforms , but one of the most intensively operated . It has no direct interchange with the London Underground . Plans to connect it stalled in the early 1980s because of the lack of progress on the Jubilee line , but it is close to Tower Hill on the Underground and to Tower Gateway on the Docklands Light Railway .",

An accompanying Underground station is on the Bakerloo line between Edgware Road and Baker Street in Transport for London 's fare zone 1 . The station opened in 1899 as the London terminus of the Great Central Main Line ( GCML ) , the last major railway to open in Britain for 100 years , linking the capital to the cities of Nottingham , Sheffield and Manchester . Marylebone was the last of London 's main line termini to be built and is one of the smallest , opening with half of the platforms originally planned . There has been an interchange with the Bakerloo line since 1907 , but not with any other lines . Traffic declined at Marylebone station from the mid-20th century , particularly after the GCML closed . By the 1980s , it was threatened with closure , but was reprieved because of commuter traffic on the London to Aylesbury Line ( a remaining part of the GCML ) and from High Wycombe . In 1993 the station found a new role as the terminus of the Chiltern Main Line . Following the privatisation of British Rail , the station was expanded with two additional platforms in 2006 and improved services to Birmingham Snow Hill .

Development in this region is restricted by the Metropolitan Green Belt . Other large settlements include the county town of Aylesbury , Marlow in the south near the Thames and Princes Risborough in the west near Oxford . Some areas without direct rail links to London , such as around the old county town of Buckingham and near Olney in the northeast , are much less populous . The largest town is Milton Keynes in the northeast , which with the surrounding area is administered as a unitary authority separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire . The remainder of the county is administered by Buckinghamshire County Council as a non-metropolitan county , and four district councils . In national elections , Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the Conservative Party .

It stands between the British Library , the Regent 's Canal and King 's Cross railway station , with which it shares a London Underground station , King 's Cross St. Pancras . The station was constructed by the Midland Railway ( MR ) , which had an extensive network across the Midlands and the North of England , but no dedicated line into London . After rail traffic problems following the 1862 International Exhibition , the MR decided to build a connection from Bedford to London with their own terminus . The station was designed by William Henry Barlow and constructed with a single-span iron roof . Following the station 's opening on 1 October 1868 , the MR constructed the Midland Grand Hotel on the station 's fa\u00e7ade , which has been widely praised for its architecture and is now a Grade I listed building along with the rest of the station . By the 1960s , St Pancras was surplus to requirements and services were diverted to King 's Cross and Euston but there was fierce opposition to its proposed closure and demolition of the station and hotel . The station was reinvented in the late 20th century as the terminal for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link in an urban regeneration plan across East London . The complex underwent an \u00a3800 million refurbishment which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2007 .

It was badly damaged by an engineering accident in 1905 and extensively rebuilt , subsequently becoming an important meeting point for military and government traffic during World War I . By this time , Charing Cross station was seen as out of date by some politicians and proposals were made to replace Hungerford Bridge with a road bridge or road/rail combination , with the station moving to the south bank of the River Thames in the case of a road-only replacement . The station was bombed several times during World War II , and was rebuilt afterwards , re-opening in 1951 . In the late 1980s , the station complex was redesigned by Terry Farrell and rebuilt to accommodate a modern office block , now known as Embankment Place .",
  "/wiki/Cannon_Street_railway_station": "Cannon Street station , also known as London Cannon Street , is a central London railway terminus and connected London Underground station in Travelcard zone 1 located on Cannon Street in the City of London and managed by Network Rail . It is one of two London termini of the South Eastern main line , the other being Charing Cross , while the Underground station is on the Circle and District lines , between Monument and Mansion House . The station runs services by Southeastern , mostly catering for commuters in southeast London and Kent , with occasional services further into the latter . The station was built on a site of the medieval steelyard , the trading base in England of the Hanseatic League . It was built by the South Eastern Railway in order to have a railway terminal in the City and compete with their rivals , the London , Chatham and Dover Railway . The City location of the station necessitated a new bridge across the River Thames , which was constructed between 1863 and 1866 . The station was initially a stop for continental services from Charing Cross , and that route was convenient for travel between the City and the West End , until the construction of the District Railway . It remained popular with commuters , though its off-peak services were discontinued in the early 20th century , leading to it being closed on Sundays for almost 100 years . The original hotel on the station was unsuccessful , and eventually closed . The station was controversially renovated in the late 1950s by John Poulson , while further construction on top of the station building occurred during the City 's 1980s property boom . The Poulson building was replaced in 2007 as part of a general renovation of the station to make it more accessible . As part of the Thameslink Programme development in the 2010s , it was re-opened on Sundays and began to offer more long-distance services in place of Charing Cross .",

  "/wiki/Elizabeth_line": "Crossrail ( to be officially named as Elizabeth line ) is a 73-mile ( 117-kilometre ) new railway line under development in the United Kingdom . Crossing London from west to east , at each end of its central core the line will divide into two branches : in the west to Reading or stations at Heathrow Airport , and in the east to Abbey Wood or Shenfield . In May 2015 , a section of one of the eastern branches , between Liverpool Street and Shenfield , was transferred to TfL Rail ; this precursor service also took control of Heathrow Connect in May 2018 and the Paddington to Reading line in December 2019 . The project was approved in 2007 , and construction began in 2009 on the central section and connections to existing lines that will become part of the route . A main feature is 13 miles ( 21 km ) of twin tunnels below the city running from Paddington to Stratford and Canary Wharf ; tunnelling was completed in May 2015 . New nine-carriage Class 345 trains will run at frequencies in the central section of up to 24 trains per hour in each direction . This will provide some relief for London Underground lines such as the Central , the District , the Jubilee line extension and the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line . Crossrail will be operated by MTR Corporation ( Crossrail ) Ltd as a London Rail concession of Transport for London , in a similar manner to London Overground . TfL 's annual revenues from the line were forecast in 2018 to be nearly \u00a3500 million per year in 2022/23 and over \u00a31 billion per year from 2024/25 . The total cost has risen from an initial budget of \u00a314.8bn to \u00a318.25bn . Originally planned to open in 2018 , Crossrail continues to be delayed and , as of January 2020 [ update ] , it is expected that the central section will open in summer 2021 ."
