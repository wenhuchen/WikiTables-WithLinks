  "/wiki/Rosenwald_School": "In informal usage , a Rosenwald School was any of the more than five thousand schools , shops , and teacher homes in the United States that were built primarily for the education of African-American children in the South during the early twentieth century . The project was the product of the partnership of Julius Rosenwald , a Jewish-American clothier who became part-owner and president of Sears , Roebuck , and Company and the African American leader , educator , and philanthropist , Booker T. Washington , who was president of Tuskegee Institute . The need arose from the chronic underfunding of public education for African-American children in the South , as black people had been discriminated against at the turn of the century and excluded from the political system in that region . Children were required to attend segregated schools . Rosenwald was the founder of the Rosenwald Fund . He contributed seed money for many schools and other philanthropic causes . He required local communities to raise matching funds to encourage their commitment to these projects . To promote collaboration between black and white people , Rosenwald required communities to commit public funds and/or labor to the schools , as well as to contribute additional cash donations after construction . With the program , millions of dollars were raised by African-American rural communities across the South to fund better education for their children and white school boards had to agree to operate and maintain the schools . Despite this program , by the mid-1930s , white schools in the South were worth more than five times per student , what black schools were worth per student ( in majority-black Mississippi , this ratio was more than 13 to one ) .",

  "/wiki/Freedmen's_Bureau": "The Bureau of Refugees , Freedmen , and Abandoned Lands , usually referred to as simply the Freedmen 's Bureau , was a U.S. government agency from 1865 to 1872 , after the Civil War , to direct provisions , clothing , and fuel . for the immediate and temporary shelter and supply of destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen and their wives and children . The Freedmen 's Bureau Bill , which established the Freedmen 's Bureau on March 3 , 1865 , was initiated by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and was intended to last for one year after the end of the Civil War . The Freedmen 's Bureau was an important agency of early Reconstruction , assisting freedmen in the South . The Bureau was made a part of the United States Department of War , as it was the only agency with an existing organization that could be assigned to the South . Headed by Union Army General Oliver O. Howard , the Bureau started operations in 1865 . In its first year , its representatives found its tasks to be very difficult , partly because Southern legislatures passed laws for Black Codes that restricted movement , conditions of labor , and other civil rights of African Americans , nearly duplicating conditions of slavery . The Freedmen 's Bureau controlled a limited amount of arable land . The Bureau 's powers were expanded to help African Americans find family members from whom they had become separated during the war . It arranged to teach them to read and write , considered critical by the freedmen themselves as well as the government . Bureau agents also served as legal advocates for African Americans in both local and national courts , mostly in cases dealing with family issues . The Bureau encouraged former major planters to rebuild their plantations and urged freed blacks to return to work for them , kept an eye on contracts between the newly free laborers and planters , and pushed whites and blacks to work together in a free labor market as employers and employees rather than as masters and slaves .",
