  "/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded yearly by the Nobel Foundation for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine . One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal . The most recent Nobel prize was announced by Karolinska Institute on 7 October 2019 , and has been awarded to Americans William Kaelin Jr. , Gregg L. Semenza and British Peter J. Ratcliffe - for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability . Some awards have been controversial . This includes one to Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz in 1949 for the prefrontal lobotomy , bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment . Other controversies resulted from disagreements over who was included in the award .",

  "/wiki/Cardiac_defibrillator": "Defibrillation is a treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , specifically ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) and non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) . A defibrillator delivers a dose of electric current ( often called a counter-shock ) to the heart . Although not fully understood , this process depolarizes a large amount of the heart muscle , ending the dysrhythmia . Subsequently , the body 's natural pacemaker in the sinoatrial node of the heart is able to re-establish normal sinus rhythm . A heart which is in asystole ( flatline ) can not be restarted by a defibrillator , but would be treated by cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . In contrast to defibrillation , synchronized electrical cardioversion is an electrical shock delivered in synchrony to the cardiac cycle . Although the person may still be critically ill , cardioversion normally aims to end poorly perfusing cardiac dysrhythmias , such as supraventricular tachycardia . Defibrillators can be external , transvenous , or implanted ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ) , depending on the type of device used or needed . Some external units , known as automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ) , automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms , meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little or no training .",

  "/wiki/Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker": "A cardiac pacemaker ( or artificial pacemaker , so as not to be confused with the natural pacemaker of the heart ) , is a medical device that generates electrical impulses delivered by electrodes to cause the heart muscle chambers ( the upper , or atria and/or the lower , or ventricles ) to contract and therefore pump blood ; by doing so this device replaces and/or regulates the function of the electrical conduction system of the heart . The primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an adequate heart rate , either because the heart 's natural pacemaker is not fast enough , or because there is a block in the heart 's electrical conduction system . Modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow a cardiologist , particularly a cardiac electrophysiologist to select the optimal pacing modes for individual patients . A specific type of pacemakers called defibrillator combines pacemaker and defibrillator functions in a single implantable device , which should be called only defibrillator , for clarity . Others , called biventricular pacemakers have multiple electrodes stimulating differing positions within the lower heart chambers to improve synchronization of the ventricles , the lower chambers of the heart .",

  "/wiki/Penicillin": "Penicillin ( PCN or pen ) is a group of antibiotics , derived originally from common moulds known as Penicillium moulds ; which includes penicillin G ( intravenous use ) , penicillin V ( use by mouth ) , procaine penicillin , and benzathine penicillin ( intramuscular use ) . Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci . They are still widely used today , though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use . About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin ; however , up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic . Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03% . Those who are allergic to penicillin are most often given cephalosporin C because of its functional groups . All penicillins are \u03b2-lactam antibiotics , which are some of the most powerful and successful achievements in modern science . Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming . People began using it to treat infections in 1942 . There are several enhanced penicillin families which are effective against additional bacteria ; these include the antistaphylococcal penicillins , aminopenicillins and the antipseudomonal penicillins . They are derived from Penicillium fungi .",

  "/wiki/Yellow_fever": "Yellow fever is a viral disease of typically short duration . In most cases , symptoms include fever , chills , loss of appetite , nausea , muscle pains particularly in the back , and headaches . Symptoms typically improve within five days . In about 15% of people , within a day of improving the fever comes back , abdominal pain occurs , and liver damage begins causing yellow skin . If this occurs , the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is increased . The disease is caused by yellow fever virus and is spread by the bite of an infected female mosquito . It infects only humans , other primates , and several types of mosquitoes . In cities , it is spread primarily by Aedes aegypti , a type of mosquito found throughout the tropics and subtropics . The virus is an RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus . The disease may be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses , especially in the early stages . To confirm a suspected case , blood-sample testing with polymerase chain reaction is required .
