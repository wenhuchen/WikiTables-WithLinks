  "/wiki/Market_capitalization": "Market capitalization , commonly called market cap , is the market value of a publicly traded company 's outstanding shares . Market capitalization is equal to the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding . Since outstanding stock is bought and sold in public markets , capitalization could be used as an indicator of public opinion of a company 's net worth and is a determining factor in some forms of stock valuation . Market cap reflects only the equity value of a company . A firm 's choice of capital structure has a significant impact on how the total value of a company is allocated between equity and debt . A more comprehensive measure is enterprise value ( EV ) , which gives effect to outstanding debt , preferred stock , and other factors . For insurance firms , a value called the embedded value ( EV ) has been used . Market capitalization is used by the investment community in ranking the size of companies , as opposed to sales or total asset figures . It is also used in ranking the relative size of stock exchanges , being a measure of the sum of the market capitalizations of all companies listed on each stock exchange . In performing such rankings , the market capitalizations are calculated at some significant date , such as June 30 or December 31 . The total capitalization of stock markets or economic regions may be compared with other economic indicators . The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world was US $ 51.2 trillion in January 2007 and rose as high as US $ 57.5 trillion in May 2008 before dropping below US $ 50 trillion in August 2008 and slightly above US $ 40 trillion in September 2008 .",

Petrochemicals feed stock like ethylene and propylene can also be produced directly by cracking crude oil without the need of using refined products of crude oil such as naphtha . Oil refineries are typically large , sprawling industrial complexes with extensive piping running throughout , carrying streams of fluids between large chemical processing units , such as distillation columns . In many ways , oil refineries use much of the technology , and can be thought of , as types of chemical plants . The crude oil feedstock has typically been processed by an oil production plant . There is usually an oil depot at or near an oil refinery for the storage of incoming crude oil feedstock as well as bulk liquid products . Petroleum refineries are very large industrial complexes that involve many different processing units and auxiliary facilities such as utility units and storage tanks . Each refinery has its own unique arrangement and combination of refining processes largely determined by the refinery location , desired products and economic considerations . An oil refinery is considered an essential part of the downstream side of the petroleum industry . Some modern petroleum refineries process as much as 800,000 to 900,000 barrels ( 127,000 to 143,000 cubic meters ) of crude oil per day .

  "/wiki/Polymer": "A polymer ( /\u02c8p\u0252l\u026am\u0259r/ ; Greek poly- , many + -mer , part ) is a large molecule , or macromolecule , composed of many repeated subunits . Due to their broad range of properties , both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life . Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function . Polymers , both natural and synthetic , are created via polymerization of many small molecules , known as monomers . Their consequently large molecular mass , relative to small molecule compounds , produces unique physical properties including toughness , viscoelasticity , and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals . The terms polymer and resin are often synonymous with plastic . The term polymer derives from the Greek word \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2 ( polus , meaning many , much ) and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ( meros , meaning part ) , and refers to a molecule whose structure is composed of multiple repeating units , from which originates a characteristic of high relative molecular mass and attendant properties . The units composing polymers derive , actually or conceptually , from molecules of low relative molecular mass . The term was coined in 1833 by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius , though with a definition distinct from the modern IUPAC definition . The modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed in 1920 by Hermann Staudinger , who spent the next decade finding experimental evidence for this hypothesis . Polymers are studied in the fields of biophysics and macromolecular science , and polymer science ( which includes polymer chemistry and polymer physics ) . Historically , products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent chemical bonds have been the primary focus of polymer science ; emerging important areas of the science now focus on non-covalent links .",

The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations .

It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product , and is classed as a pitch . Before the 20th century , the term asphaltum was also used .

Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products , including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs . In material sciences and engineering , the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance , although there is regional variation as to which term is most common . Worldwide , geologists tend to favor the term bitumen for the naturally occurring material . For the manufactured material , which is a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils , bitumen is the prevalent term in much of the world ; however , in American English , asphalt is more commonly used . To help avoid confusion , the phrase liquid asphalt , asphalt binder , or asphalt cement is used in the U.S. Colloquially , various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as tar , as in the name of the La Brea Tar Pits , although tar is a different material .",

The technique is not new but has not been used extensively on residual oil zones , low-grade deposits of petroleum such as the 40 square miles in the Permian Basin of Texas leased by Tiny Kamalabo .

  "/wiki/Bagasse": "Bagasse ( /b\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u00e6s/ b\u0259-GAS-se ' ) is the dry pulpy fibrous residue that remains after sugarcane or sorghum stalks are crushed to extract their juice . It is used as a biofuel for the production of heat , energy , and electricity , and in the manufacture of pulp and building materials . Agave bagasse is a similar material that consists of the tissue of the blue agave after extraction of the sap .",
  "/wiki/Blast_furnace_gas": "Blast furnace gas ( BFG ) is a by-product of blast furnaces that is generated when the iron ore is reduced with coke to metallic iron . It has a very low heating value , about 93 BTU/cubic foot ( 3.5 MJ/m3 ) , because it consists of about 60 percent nitrogen and 18-20% carbon dioxide , which are not flammable . The rest is mostly carbon monoxide , which has a fairly low heating value already and some ( 2-4% ) hydrogen . It is commonly used as a fuel within the steel works , but it can be used in boilers and power plants equipped to burn it . It may be combined with natural gas or coke oven gas before combustion or a flame support with richer gas or oil is provided to sustain combustion . Particulate matter is removed so that it can be burned more cleanly . Blast furnace gas is sometimes flared without generating heat or electricity . Blast furnace gas is generated at higher pressure and at about 100-150 \u00b0C ( 212-302 \u00b0F ) in a modern blast furnace . This pressure is utilized to operate a generator ( Top-gas-pressure Recovery Turbine - i.e . TRT in short ) , which can generate electrical energy up to 35 kWh/t of pig iron without burning any fuel . Dry type TRTs can generate more power than wet type TRT . Auto ignition point of blast furnace gas is approximate 630-650 \u00b0C ( 1,166-1,202 \u00b0F ) and it has LEL ( Lower Explosive Limit ) of 27% & UEL ( Upper Explosive Limit ) of 75% in an air-gas mixture at normal temperature and pressure ."
