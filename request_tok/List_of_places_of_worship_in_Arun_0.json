  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

  "/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England": "The Norman conquest of England ( in Britain , often called the Norman Conquest or the Conquest ) was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman , Breton , Flemish , and French soldiers led by the Duke of Normandy , later styled William the Conqueror . William 's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor , who may have encouraged William 's hopes for the throne . Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson . The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford , but Godwinson 's army defeated and killed Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September . Within days , William landed in southern England . Harold marched south to oppose him , leaving a significant portion of his army in the north . Harold 's army confronted William 's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings ; William 's force defeated Harold , who was killed in the engagement . Although William 's main rivals were gone , he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072 . The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated ; some of the elite fled into exile . To control his new kingdom , William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land with the Domesday Book , a manuscript record of the Great Survey of much of England and parts of Wales being completed by 1086 . Other effects of the conquest included the court and government , the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites , and changes in the composition of the upper classes , as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king . More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life : the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery , which may or may not have been linked to the invasion .",

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

  "/wiki/Stained_glass": "The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it . Throughout its thousand-year history , the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings . Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows , the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture . Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight .

  "/wiki/Timber_framing": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers , creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs . It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century . If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered , and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect . The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany . Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast . The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber . Hewing this with broadaxes , adzes , and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers ( brace and bit ) and other woodworking tools , artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building .

The population of the Bognor Regis built-up area , including Felpham and Aldwick , was 63,855 at the 2011 census . A seaside resort was developed by Sir Richard Hotham in the late 18th century on what was a sandy , undeveloped coastline . It has been claimed that Hotham and his new resort are portrayed in Jane Austen 's unfinished novel Sanditon . The resort grew slowly in the first half of the 19th century but grew rapidly following the coming of the railway in 1864 . In 1929 the area was chosen by advisors to King George V which led to its regal suffix , by royal consent . Butlin 's has been present in the town since the early 1930s when an amusement park and zoo were opened .

  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle .

  "/wiki/Lady_chapel": "A Lady chapel or lady chapel is a traditional British term for a chapel dedicated to Our Lady , the Blessed Virgin Mary , particularly those inside a cathedral or other large church . The chapels are also known as a Mary chapel or a Marian chapel , and they were traditionally the largest side chapel of a cathedral , placed eastward from the high altar and forming a projection from the main building as in Winchester Cathedral . Most Roman Catholic and many Anglican cathedrals still have such chapels , while mid-sized churches have smaller side-altars dedicated to the Virgin . The occurrence of lady chapels varies by location and exist in most of the French cathedrals and churches where they form part of the chevet . In Belgium they were not introduced before the 14th century ; in some cases they are of the same size as the other chapels of the chevet , but in others ( probably rebuilt at a later period ) they became much more important features . Some of the best examples can be found in churches of the Renaissance period in Italy and Spain .",
  "/wiki/Parish_church": "A parish church ( or parochial church ) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish . In many parts of the world , especially in rural areas , the parish church may play a significant role in community activities , often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events .

Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor , destitute , and hungry by meeting both their physical and spiritual needs . It is present in 131 countries , running charity shops , operating shelters for the homeless and disaster relief and humanitarian aid to developing countries .

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group . The main movements are Baptist churches , Pentecostalism , charismatic Evangelicalism , neo-charismatic Evangelicalism and nondenominational Evangelicalism .",

  "/wiki/House_church": "A house church or home church is a label used to describe a group of Christians who regularly gather for worship in private homes . The group may be part of a larger Christian body , such as a parish , but some have been independent groups that see the house church as the primary form of Christian community . Sometimes these groups meet because the membership is small , and a home is the most appropriate place to assemble until such time as the group has sufficient funds to rent a regular place to meet ( as in the beginning phase of the British New Church Movement ) . Sometimes this meeting style is advantageous because the group is a member of a Christian congregation which is otherwise banned from meeting as is the case in China and Iran . Some recent Christian writers have supported the view that the Christian Church should meet in houses , and have based the operation of their communities around multiple small home meetings . Other Christian groups choose to meet in houses when they are in the early phases of church growth because a house is the most affordable option for the small group to meet until the number of people attending the group is sufficient to warrant moving to a commercial location such as a church building . House church organizations claim that this approach is preferable to public meetings in dedicated buildings because it is a more effective way of building community and personal relationships , and it helps the group to engage in outreach more naturally . Some believe small churches were a deliberate apostolic pattern in the first century , and they were intended by Christ .",

  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_Movement": "The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920 , emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement . It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms , and often used medieval , romantic , or folk styles of decoration . It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial . It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s , and its influence continued among craft makers , designers , and town planners long afterwards . The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 , although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years . It was inspired by the ideas of architect Augustus Pugin , writer John Ruskin , and designer William Morris . The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America . It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced .",

  "/wiki/Spiritualism": "Spiritualism is a religious movement based on the belief that the spirits of the dead exist and have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living . The afterlife , or the spirit world , is seen by spiritualists , not as a static place , but as one in which spirits continue to evolve . These two beliefs - that contact with spirits is possible , and that spirits are more advanced than humans - lead spiritualists to a third belief : that spirits are capable of providing useful knowledge about moral and ethical issues , as well as about the nature of God . Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as spirit guides - specific spirits , often contacted , who are relied upon for spiritual guidance . Spiritism , a branch of spiritualism developed by Allan Kardec and today practiced mostly in Continental Europe and Latin America , especially in Brazil , emphasizes reincarnation . Spiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s , especially in English-speaking countries . By 1897 , spiritualism was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe , mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes . Spiritualism flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization , attaining cohesion through periodicals , tours by trance lecturers , camp meetings , and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums . Many prominent spiritualists were women , and like most spiritualists , supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women 's suffrage . By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud perpetrated by mediums , and formal spiritualist organizations began to appear . Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational spiritualist churches in the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom ."
