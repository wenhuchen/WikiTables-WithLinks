He also recited the Olympic Oath at the Games ' opening ceremonies , which were presided over by then-New York State Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt . Shea chose not to defend his Olympic titles at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen , at the request of a Lake Placid rabbi who asked him not to compete in Hitler 's Germany . Decades later , Shea played a major role in returning the Winter Olympics to Lake Placid in 1980 as a member of the 1980 Olympic Organizing Committee . Afterward , he served as Vice Chairman of the Olympic Regional Development Authority , the organization that manages the venues used in the 1980 Games . His son , Jim Shea Sr. , was a 1964 Olympian in Nordic Combined and Cross Country Skiing ; his grandson , Jim Shea Jr. was the gold medalist in men 's Skeleton Sledding at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City . In the lead-up to the Salt Lake Games , Jack participated in the Olympic torch relay , lighting a cauldron at the speed skating oval in Lake Placid where he had won his medals in 1932 . Shea was killed in a head-on automobile collision by a drunk driver 17 days before he was to watch his grandson participate in the Salt Lake Games .",
