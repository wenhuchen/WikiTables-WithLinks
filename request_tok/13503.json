The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies .

Kitano rose to prominence in the 1970s as one half of the comedy duo Two Beat , before going solo and becoming one of the three biggest comedians in the country .

Many of Kitano 's films are dramas about yakuza gangsters or the police . Described by critics as using an acting style that is highly deadpan or a camera style that approaches near-stasis , Kitano often uses long takes during which little appears to be happening , or editing that cuts immediately to the aftermath of an event .

  "/wiki/Comedy_film": "A comedy film is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor . These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect . Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending ( black comedy being an exception ) . One of the oldest genres in film - and derived from the classical comedy in theatre - , some of the very first silent movies were comedies , as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions , without requiring sound . When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s , comedy films took another swing , as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue . Comedy , compared with other film genres , puts much more focus on individual stars , with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity . While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse , others contain political or social commentary ( such as The King of Comedy and Wag the Dog ) .",
