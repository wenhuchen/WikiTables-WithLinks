Most members of the different Sara languages/dialects consider their speech form distinct languages , but there is currently insufficient language information to determine which speech varieties need to be considered distinct languages , and which are dialects of other languages .

They are the largest ethnic group in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and one of the major ethnic groups in the other two countries they are found in . In 1975 , the Kongo population was reported as 4,040,000 . The Kongo people were among the earliest sub-Saharan Africans to welcome Portuguese traders in 1483 CE , and began converting to Catholicism in the late 15th century . They were among the first to protest slavery in letters to the King of Portugal in the 1510s and 1520s , then succumbed to the demands for slaves from the Portuguese through the 16th century . The Kongo people were a part of the major slave raiding , capture and export trade of African slaves to the European colonial interests in 17th and 18th century . The slave raids , colonial wars and the 19th-century Scramble for Africa split the Kongo people into Portuguese , Belgian and French parts . In the early 20th century , they became one of the most active ethnic groups in the efforts to decolonize Africa , helping liberate the three nations to self governance .
