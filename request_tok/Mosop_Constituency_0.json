Odinga , as a member of the Luo ethnic group , succeeded in creating a wider base by building a coalition with regional leaders from the Luhya in Western Kenya , Kalenjin from the Rift Valley and Muslim leaders from the Coast Province . Kibaki was declared the winner with 46% of the vote , and was sworn in at State House on 30 December . However , opposition leader Raila Odinga also claimed victory , and civil unrest broke out resulting in the deaths of several hundred people and the displacement of up to 600,000 .
