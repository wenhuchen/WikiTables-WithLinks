  "/wiki/Brooklyn\u2013Battery_Tunnel": "The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel ( officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel ) is a toll tunnel in New York City that connects Red Hook in Brooklyn with Battery Park in Manhattan . The tunnel consists of twin tubes that each carry two traffic lanes under the mouth of the East River . Although it passes just offshore of Governors Island , the tunnel does not provide vehicular access to the island . With a length of 9,117 feet ( 2,779 m ) , the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel is the longest continuous underwater vehicular tunnel in North America . Plans for the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel date to the 1920s . Official plans to build the tunnel were submitted in 1930 , but were initially not carried out . The New York City Tunnel Authority , created in 1936 , was tasked with constructing the tunnel . After unsuccessful attempts to secure federal funds , New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses proposed a Brooklyn-Battery Bridge . However , the public opposed the bridge plan , and the Army Corps of Engineers rejected the plan several times , concerned that the bridge would impede shipping access to the Brooklyn Navy Yard . This prompted city officials to reconsider plans for a tunnel . The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel started construction on October 28 , 1940 , but its completion was delayed due to World War II-related material shortages . The tunnel opened on May 25 , 1950 .",

It was the first underwater subway tunnel connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn , with construction taking place between 1903 and 1907 .",
  "/wiki/IRT_Lexington_Avenue_Line": "The IRT Lexington Avenue Line ( also known as the IRT East Side Line and the IRT Lexington-Fourth Avenue Line ) is one of the lines of the A Division of the New York City Subway , stretching from Lower Manhattan north to 125th Street in East Harlem . The line is served by the 4 , \u200b5 , \u200b6 , and < 6 > trains . The line was constructed in two main portions by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) , a private operator . The first portion , from City Hall north to 42nd Street , was opened between 1904 and 1908 , and is part of the first subway line in the city . The original subway turned west across 42nd Street at the Grand Central station , then went north at Broadway , serving the present-day IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line . The second portion of the line , north of 42nd Street , was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts , which were signed between the IRT ; the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , via a subsidiary ; and the City of New York . For decades , the Lexington Avenue Line was the only line in Manhattan that directly served the Upper East Side and East Midtown ; this four-track line is the most used rapid transit line in the United States . Its average of 1.3 million daily riders is more than the total riderships of the transit systems of San Francisco ( 452,600 weekday passengers ) , Chicago ( 772,900 weekday passengers ) , and Boston ( 569,200 ) . In 2007 , its ridership also exceeded that of the entire Washington Metro , and in part spurred the construction of the parallel Second Avenue Subway that year , to relieve congestion on the Lexington Avenue line . Four stations along this line have been abandoned . When platforms were lengthened to fit ten cars , it was deemed most beneficial to close these stations and open new entrances for adjacent stations . The 18th Street station was abandoned because of the proximity to both 14th Street-Union Square and 23rd Street .",

The line is part of the BMT Eastern Division , and is occasionally referred to as the Eastern District Line . This refers to Williamsburg , which was described as Brooklyn 's Eastern District when the City of Williamsburg was annexed by the former City of Brooklyn .

Founded in 1971 as a quasi-public corporation to operate many U.S. passenger rail services , it receives a combination of state and federal subsidies but is managed as a for-profit organization . Amtrak 's headquarters is located one block west of Union Station in Washington , D.C. Amtrak serves more than 500 destinations in 46 states and three Canadian provinces , operating more than 300 trains daily over 21,400 miles ( 34,000 km ) of track .

Nearly two-thirds of passengers come from the 10 largest metropolitan areas ; 83% of passengers travel on routes shorter than 400 miles ( 645 km ) .

It is publicly owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which refers to it as MTA Long Island Rail Road . The LIRR logo combines the circular MTA logo with the text Long Island Rail Road , and appears on the sides of trains . The LIRR is one of two commuter rail systems owned by the MTA , the other being the Metro-North Railroad in the northern suburbs of the New York area .

  "/wiki/Northeast_Corridor": "The Northeast Corridor ( NEC ) is an electrified railroad line in the Northeast megalopolis of the United States and the busiest rail corridor in the Western Hemisphere . Owned primarily by Amtrak , it runs from Boston through Providence , New Haven , New York City , Philadelphia , Wilmington , and Baltimore to Washington , D.C . The NEC closely parallels Interstate 95 for most of its length , and is the busiest passenger rail line in the United States both by ridership and by service frequency as of 2013 . The NEC carries more than 2,200 trains daily . Branches to Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , Springfield , Massachusetts , and various points in Virginia are not considered part of the Northeast Corridor , despite frequent service from routes that run largely on the corridor . The corridor is used by many Amtrak trains , including the high-speed Acela Express , intercity trains , and several long-distance trains . Most of the corridor also has frequent commuter rail service , operated by the MBTA , Shore Line East , Metro-North Railroad , New Jersey Transit , SEPTA , and MARC . Several companies run freight trains over sections of the NEC . Much of the line is built for speeds higher than the 79 mph ( 127 km/h ) maximum allowed on many U.S. tracks ; in fact , the only high-speed rail services in the Americas operate exclusively on the corridor : Amtrak operates Northeast Regional , Keystone Service and Acela Express trains , the first two reaching 125 mph ( 201 km/h ) and the latter achieving 150 mph ( 240 km/h ) on a few sections in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ; the MARC commuter rail system , which has operations on the line , has certain express trains going up to 125 mph ( 201 km/h ) . Acela covers the 225 mi ( 362 km ) between New York and Washington , D.C. , in under 3 hours , and the 229 mi ( 369 km ) between New York and Boston in under 3.5 hours . Under Amtrak 's $ 151 billion Northeast Corridor plan , which hopes to roughly halve travel times by 2040 , trips between New York and Washington via Philadelphia would take 94 minutes .",
