  "/wiki/John_A._Macdonald": "Sir John Alexander Macdonald [ a ] ( 11 January 1815 [ b ] - 6 June 1891 ) was the first prime minister of Canada ( 1867-1873 , 1878-1891 ) . The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation , he had a political career which spanned almost half a century . Macdonald was born in Scotland ; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada ( today in eastern Ontario ) . As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston , which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada . By 1857 , he had become premier under the colony 's unstable political system . In 1864 , when no party proved capable of governing for long , Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival , George Brown , that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform . Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences , which resulted in the British North America Act , 1867 and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867 . Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation , and served 19 years ; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer . In 1873 , he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway . However , he was re-elected in 1878 , continuing until he died in office in 1891 . Macdonald 's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion , using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party , promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy , and completing the railway . He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from the national government in Ottawa .",
  "/wiki/Militia": "A militia ( /m\u026a\u02c8l\u026a\u0283\u0259/ ) is generally an army or some other fighting organization of non-professional soldiers , citizens of a nation , or subjects of a state , who can be called upon for military service during a time of need , as opposed to a professional force of regular , full-time military personnel , or historically , members of a warrior nobility class ( e.g. , knights or samurai ) . Generally unable to hold ground against regular forces , it is common for militias to be used for aiding regular troops by skirmishing , holding fortifications , or irregular warfare , instead of being used in offensive campaigns by themselves . Militia are often limited by local civilian laws to serve only in their home region , and to serve only for a limited time ; this further reduces their use in long military campaigns . With the emergence of professional forces ( in the form of mercenaries whose livelihood was military service ) during the Renaissance , Western European militias wilted ; later however , they would be revived as part of Florentine civic humanism , which held that professional militaries were a result of corruption , and admired the Roman model . The civic humanist ideal of the militia was spread through Europe by the writings of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli ( According to H\u00f6rnqvist , The Prince , ch . 12 and 13 , Discourses on Livy , and The Art of War . ) Beginning in the late 20th century , some militias ( in particular officially recognized and sanctioned militias of a government ) act as professional forces , while still being part-time or on-call organizations . For instance , the members of U.S. Army National Guard units are considered professional soldiers , as they are trained to maintain the same standards as their full-time ( active duty ) counterparts . [ citation needed ] Militias thus can be military or paramilitary , depending on the instance . Some of the contexts in which the term militia is used include :",

  "/wiki/Upper_Canada_Rebellion": "The Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the perceived oligarchic government of the British colony of Upper Canada ( present-day Ontario ) in December 1837 . While public grievances had existed for years , it was the rebellion in Lower Canada ( present-day Quebec ) , which started the previous month , that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt . The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began , although resistance lingered until 1838 ( and became more violent ) - mainly through the support of the Hunters ' Lodges , a secret anti-British , US-based militia that emerged around the Great Lakes , and launched the Patriot War in 1838-39 . Some historians suggest that although they were not as directly successful or as large , that the rebellions in 1837 should be viewed in the wider context of the late 18th and early 19th century Atlantic revolutions including the American Revolutionary War in 1776 , the French Revolution of 1789-1799 , the Haitian Revolution of 1791-1804 , the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , and the independence struggles of Spanish America ( 1810-1825 ) . While these rebellions differed in that they also struggled for republicanism , they were inspired by similar social problems stemming from poorly regulated oligarchies , and sought the same democratic ideals , which were also shared by the United Kingdom 's Chartists . The rebellion led directly to Lord Durham 's Report on the Affairs of British North America , and to The British North America Act , 1840 , which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system , leading to the formation of Canada as a nation in 1867 .",

Mackenzie was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1861 , as a supporter of George Brown . In 1867 , Mackenzie was elected to the new House of Commons of Canada for the Liberal Party . He became leader of the party ( thus Leader of the Opposition ) in mid-1873 , and a few months later succeeded John A. Macdonald as prime minister , following Macdonald 's resignation in the aftermath of the Pacific Scandal . Mackenzie and the Liberals won a clear majority at the 1874 election . He was popular among the general public for his humble background and apparent democratic tendencies . As prime minister , Mackenzie continued the nation-building programme that had been begun by his predecessor . His government established the Supreme Court of Canada and Royal Military College of Canada , and created the District of Keewatin to better administer Canada 's newly acquired western territories .",
  "/wiki/Canadian_Militia": "The Canadian Militia is a traditional title given to militia units raised from local communities for the defence of Canada . The term has been used to describe sedentary military units raised in Canada , as well as its regular army , referred to as the active militias , from 1855 to 1940 . The earliest militia units in Canada dates back to the French regime in New France . In the French colony , a compulsory militia of settlers from every parish was raised in order to support the military of New France in the defence , and expansion of the colony . Following the British conquest of New France in 1760 , sedentary militia units continued to be raised , in support of British military units stationed in the Canadas ( and the succeeding Province of Canada ) . Enrolment in the sedentary militias occurred until 1873 . The Canadian Militia also referred to the regular army established by the Province of Canada under the Militia Act of 1855 . The two organizations that originated from the Act , the Permanent Active Militia ( PAM ) , and the Non-Permanent Active Militia ( NPAM ) , served as Canada 's regular army following Canadian Confederation in 1867 . In November 1940 , both PAM and NPAM were reorganized into the Canadian Army , with PAM eventually becoming the Army 's Regular Force , and NPAM becoming the Army Reserve .",

In the lead-up to Confederation he was a prominent advocate for the rights of English-speaking Quebecers . In the 1867 federal election , Abbott was elected to the new House of Commons of Canada as a member of the Conservative Party .

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country .

  "/wiki/Lester_Bowles_Pearson": "Lester Bowles Mike Pearson PC OM CC OBE ( 23 April 1897 - 27 December 1972 ) was a Canadian scholar , statesman , soldier , prime minister , and diplomat , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for organizing the United Nations Emergency Force to resolve the Suez Canal Crisis . He was the 14th prime minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968 , as the head of two back-to-back Liberal minority governments following elections in 1963 and 1965 . During Pearson 's time as prime minister , his Liberal minority governments introduced universal health care , student loans , the Canada Pension Plan , the Order of Canada , and the Maple Leaf flag . His Liberal government also unified Canada 's armed forces . Pearson convened the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism , and he kept Canada out of the Vietnam War . In 1967 , his government passed Bill C-168 , which de facto abolished capital punishment in Canada by restricting it to a few capital offences for which it was never used , and which themselves were abolished in 1976 . With these accomplishments , together with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy , Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century and is ranked among the greatest Canadian prime ministers .",
  "/wiki/Canadian_Army_Medical_Corps": "The Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps ( RCAMC ) was an administrative corps of the Canadian Army . The Militia Medical Service was established in 1898 . It consisted of an Army Medical Service ( officers ) and an Army Medical Corps ( other ranks ) . The Hon . Sir F.W . Borden KCMG was appointed Honorary Colonel of the militia 's Canadian Army Medical Corps on 1 August 1901 . The regimental medical personnel of the Permanent Active Militia were absorbed into the Corps on 2 July 1904 . The regular component was titled the Permanent Active Militia Medical Corps ( P.A.M.C . ) and the militia component was titled the Army Medical Corps ( A.M.C. ) . As the origin of a permanent medical corps , this date has since been considered the birth of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps for purposes of seniority among the corps of the Canadian Army , coming after the Royal Army Service Corps , 1903 . ( Though in the militia the medical corps was the first of the support branches to be formed ) . Separate titles for permanent and non-permanent components of the medical corps were discarded during the re-organization of 1 May 1909 .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Flying_Corps": "The Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War , until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force . During the early part of the war , the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance . This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements , the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transport facilities . At the start of World War I the RFC , commanded by Brigadier-General Sir David Henderson , consisted of five squadrons - one observation balloon squadron ( RFC No 1 Squadron ) and four aeroplane squadrons . These were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914 but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915 . Aerial photography was attempted during 1914 , but again only became effective the next year . By 1918 , photographic images could be taken from 15,000 feet and were interpreted by over 3,000 personnel . Parachutes were not available to pilots of heavier-than-air craft in the RFC - nor were they used by the RAF during the First World War - although the Calthrop Guardian Angel parachute ( 1916 model ) was officially adopted just as the war ended . By this time parachutes had been used by balloonists for three years . On 17 August 1917 , South African General Jan Smuts presented a report to the War Council on the future of air power . Because of its potential for the 'devastation of enemy lands and the destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale ' , he recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with the Army and Royal Navy . The formation of the new service would also make the under-used men and machines of the Royal Naval Air Service ( RNAS ) available for action on the Western Front and end the inter-service rivalries that at times had adversely affected aircraft procurement .",

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada 's third longest-serving Prime Minister , behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald . Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer , intellectual , and activist in Quebec politics . He joined the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965 , quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson 's Parliamentary Secretary . In 1967 , he was appointed Minister of Justice . Trudeau 's outgoing personality caused a media sensation , inspiring Trudeaumania , and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968 , when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada . From the late 1960s until the early 1980s , Trudeau 's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life . After his appointment as Prime Minister , he won the 1968 , 1972 and 1974 elections , before narrowly losing in 1979 . He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards , in 1980 , and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election . Despite his personal motto , Reason before passion , his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office . Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau 's intellect and his political acumen , maintaining national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement , suppressing a Quebec terrorist crisis , fostering a pan-Canadian identity , and in achieving sweeping institutional reform , including the implementation of official bilingualism , patriation of the Constitution , and the establishment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Critics accused him of arrogance , of economic mismanagement , and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies .",

In his political career , Turner held several prominent Cabinet posts , including Minister of Justice and Minister of Finance , under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1968 to 1975 . Amid a global recession and the prospect of having to implement the unpopular wage and price controls , Turner surprisingly resigned his position in 1975 . After a hiatus from politics from 1975 to 1984 , Turner returned and successfully contested the Liberal leadership . Turner held the office of Prime Minister for 79 days ( the second-shortest tenure in Canadian history after Sir Charles Tupper ) , as he advised the Governor General to dissolve Parliament immediately after being sworn in , and went on to lose the 1984 election in a landslide .

His tenure as prime minister was marked by the introduction of major economic reforms , such as the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the Goods and Services Tax . Prior to his political career , he was a prominent lawyer and businessman in Montreal . He later ran for the Progressive Conservatives and won in a landslide in the 1984 Canadian federal election , defeating John Turner of the Liberals and Ed Broadbent of the NDP , not only winning every single province and territory but also capturing over 50% of the vote for the first time since 1958 and increasing his party 's seats by 111 , up to 211 seats , the highest amount of seats won by any party in Canadian history . The 6.3 million votes won by Mulroney also remained a record until the Liberals ' victory in 2015 . Throughout his political career , Mulroney 's fluency in English and French gave him a decisive advantage . He brought forth a constitutional reform , the Meech Lake Accord , in 1987 , meant to persuade the government of Quebec to endorse the 1982 constitutional amendments . It was not ratified by the provincial governments of Manitoba and Newfoundland before the June ratification deadline , and thus met its demise in 1990 . This loss led to another round of meetings in Charlottetown in 1991 and 1992 . These negotiations culminated in Mulroney introducing the Charlottetown Accord , which would create extensive changes to the constitution , including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society . However , the agreement was defeated by a large margin in a national referendum in October 1992 . Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney 's rising unpopularity for the fall of the Accord .",
