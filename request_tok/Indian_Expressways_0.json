  "/wiki/Eastern_Freeway_Mumbai": "Wilbur Smith and Associates , commissioned in 1962 to study transportation in Bombay , recommended construction of a freeway from the southern part of the city to the Western Express Highway near Bandra . An eastern freeway to connect the Eastern Suburbs with South Mumbai was also proposed in the Central Road Research Institute 's transport improvement plan for Bombay in 1983 . It also recommended a western freeway to connect the Western Suburbs with South Mumbai . However , the plan was not given serious consideration until about 2003 , when work on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link ( BWSL ) , which was part of the proposed Western Freeway , had begun . It led to an increase in traffic in eastern Mumbai , and the MMRDA decided to consider building the Eastern Freeway . The MMRDA called for bid in 2007 , and construction of the main freeway began in January 2008 , except for the Anik-Panjarpol link road on which construction had begun in 2004 . The Eastern Freeway was scheduled to be completed by 18 January 2011 but faced several delays due to obtaining permissions for construction in forest and salt pan areas , reclaiming of land and difficulties posed by unmapped underground utilities in the construction work . The delays also escalated the cost of the 9.29 km elevated road from the initial \u20b95.31 billion ( US $ 74 million ) to \u20b95.72 billion ( US $ 80 million ) . A 14 km section of the 17 km Eastern Freeway was completed by 24 May 2013 . Chavan had promised to open the freeway on 7 June 2013 , when he inaugurated the Milan flyover in May 2013 . The delay in opening the freeway led to criticism from transport experts and the media , and protests from angry Mumbai residents . The problem was exacerbated by heavy monsoon rains that caused most other roads to be waterlogged .",
  "/wiki/Western_Freeway_Mumbai": "The Western Freeway is a proposed controlled-access highway in Mumbai , India that would stretch from Marine Drive in South Mumbai to Kandivli in the north , a distance of 29 km . The project envisions the construction of four major sea links over the Arabian Sea along Mumbai 's western coastline to reduce traffic-congestion between the Western Suburbs and South Mumbai . The first sea link , known as the Bandra-Worli Sea Link , was completed in June 2009 , and connects Bandra in the north and Worli in the south with a cable stayed bridge spanning the Mahim Bay . This development relieved congestion on the Mahim Causeway , which until then had been the only road between the Western Suburbs and South Mumbai on the western sea front . The second sea bridge , the Versova-Bandra Sea Link , is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by September 2023 . In 2011 , the Coastal Road was proposed as a lower-cost alternative to the Western Freeway . The 8-lane , 29.2-km long Coastal Road would run along Mumbai 's western coastline connecting Marine Lines to Kandivali . The Coastal Road connects Marine Lines with the Worli end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link through roads built on reclaimed land and tunnels rendering the proposed Haji Ali-Nariman Point Sea Link and Worli-Haji Ali Sea Link of the Western Freeway redundant . Construction of a 9.98 km section of the Coastal Road between Marine Lines and Worli began in 2018 and is expected to be completed by 2023 ."
