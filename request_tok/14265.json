  "/wiki/Old_Norse": "Old Norse was a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and their overseas settlements from about the 9th to the 13th centuries . The Proto-Norse language developed into Old Norse by the 8th century , and Old Norse began to develop into the modern North Germanic languages in the mid- to late 14th century , ending the language phase known as Old Norse . These dates , however , are not absolute , since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century . Old Norse was divided into three dialects : Old West Norse , Old East Norse , and Old Gutnish . Old West and East Norse formed a dialect continuum , with no clear geographical boundary between them . For example , Old East Norse traits were found in eastern Norway , although Old Norwegian is classified as Old West Norse , and Old West Norse traits were found in western Sweden . Most speakers spoke Old East Norse in what is present-day Denmark and Sweden . Old Gutnish , the more obscure dialectal branch , is sometimes included in the Old East Norse dialect due to geographical associations . It developed its own unique features and shared in changes to both other branches . The 12th-century Icelandic Gray Goose Laws state that Swedes , Norwegians , Icelanders , and Danes spoke the same language , d\u01ebnsk tunga ( Danish tongue ; speakers of Old East Norse would have said dansk tunga ) . Another term , used especially commonly with reference to West Norse , was norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l or norr\u01ffnt m\u00e1l ( Nordic/Northern speech ) . Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages Icelandic , Faroese ( both inherited cases from the language ) , Norwegian , Danish , and Swedish , of which Norwegian , Danish and Swedish retain considerable mutual intelligibility .",
  "/wiki/Old_English": "Old English ( \u00c6nglisc , Anglisc , Englisc , pronounced [ \u02c8\u00e6\u014b\u0261li\u0283 ] ) , or Anglo-Saxon , is the earliest historical form of the English language , spoken in England and southern and eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages . It was probably brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the mid-5th century , and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century . After the Norman conquest of 1066 , English was replaced , for a time , as the language of the upper classes by Anglo-Norman , a relative of French . This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era , as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman , developing into a phase known now as Middle English . Old English developed from a set of Anglo-Frisian or Ingvaeonic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles , Saxons and Jutes . As the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in England , their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain : Common Brittonic , a Celtic language , and Latin , brought to Britain by Roman invasion . Old English had four main dialects , associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms : Mercian , Northumbrian , Kentish and West Saxon . It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period , although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian . The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century . Old English is one of the West Germanic languages , and its closest relatives are Old Frisian and Old Saxon . Like other old Germanic languages , it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study . Within Old English grammar nouns , adjectives , pronouns and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms , and word order is much freer .",
  "/wiki/Nanna_(Norse_deity)": "In Norse mythology , Nanna Nepsd\u00f3ttir or simply Nanna is a goddess associated with the god Baldr . Accounts of Nanna vary greatly by source . In the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson , Nanna is the wife of Baldr and the couple produced a son , the god Forseti . After Baldr 's death , Nanna dies of grief . Nanna is placed on Baldr 's ship with his corpse and the two are set aflame and pushed out to sea . In Hel , Baldr and Nanna are united again . In an attempt to bring back Baldr from the dead , the god Herm\u00f3\u00f0r rides to Hel and , upon receiving the hope of resurrection from the being Hel , Nanna gives Herm\u00f3\u00f0r gifts to give to the goddess Frigg ( a robe of linen ) , the goddess Fulla ( a finger-ring ) , and others ( unspecified ) . Nanna is frequently mentioned in the poetry of skalds and a Nanna , who may or may not be the same figure , is mentioned once in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources . An account provided by Saxo Grammaticus in his 12th century work Gesta Danorum records Nanna as a human female , the daughter of King Gevar , and the love interest of both the demi-god Baldr and the human H\u00f6\u00f0r . Spurred by their mutual attraction to Nanna , Baldr and H\u00f6\u00f0r repeatedly do battle . Nanna is only interested in H\u00f6\u00f0r and weds him , while Baldr wastes away from nightmares about Nanna .

  "/wiki/Forseti": "Forseti ( Old Norse the presiding one , actually president in modern Icelandic and Faroese ) is the god of justice and reconciliation in Norse mythology . He is generally identified with Fosite , a god of the Frisians . Jacob Grimm noted that if , as Adam of Bremen states , Fosite 's sacred island was Heligoland , that would make him an ideal candidate for a deity known to both Frisians and Scandinavians , but that it is surprising he is never mentioned by Saxo Grammaticus . Grimm took Forseti , praeses , to be the older form of the name , first postulating an unattested Old High German equivalent *forasizo ( cf . modern German Vorsitzender one who presides ) . but later preferring a derivation from fors , a whirling stream or cataract , connected to the spring and the god 's veneration by seagoing peoples . It is plausible that Fosite is the older name and Forseti a folk etymology . According to the German philologist , Hans Kuhn , the Germanic form Fosite is linguistically identical to Greek Poseidon , hence the original name must have been introduced before the Proto-Germanic sound change , probably via Greek sailors purchasing amber . The Greek traveller Pytheas of Massalia , who describes the amber trade , is known to have visited the region around 325 BC .",

Beowulf , a hero of the Geats , comes to the aid of Hrothgar , the king of the Danes , whose mead hall in Heorot has been under attack by a monster known as Grendel . After Beowulf slays him , Grendel 's mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated . Victorious , Beowulf goes home to Geatland ( G\u00f6taland in modern Sweden ) and becomes king of the Geats .

The ballad probably dates back to the late Middle Ages . The Danish botanist and clergyman Hans Christian Lyngbye published the first edition of it and other Faroese ballads in 1822 , in phonetically spelt Faroese with a facing-page translation into Danish ( with the assistance of Jens Christian Svabo ) . A prose Danish translation was published by V.U . Hammershaimb in 1851 in F\u00e6r\u00f6iske Kv\u00e6der . In the ballad , a farmer loses a bet with a giant , called Skrymir in some verses , who demands his son . The farmer asks first Odin , then H\u0153nir , and finally Loki for assistance . Odin has a field of grain grow up overnight and conceals the boy as one grain on an axe in the middle of the field . The boy is afraid because the giant 's hand is brushing against the particular grain , but Odin calls him to him and returns him to his parents , telling them he has fulfilled the task . H\u0153nir causes seven swans to fly over the sound ; the boy is a feather in the middle of a swan 's head .

  "/wiki/Proto-Germanic": "Proto-Germanic ( abbreviated PGmc ; also called Common Germanic ) is the reconstructed proto-language of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages . Proto-Germanic developed from pre-Proto-Germanic into three branches during the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era : West Germanic , East Germanic and North Germanic , which however remained in contact over a considerable time , especially the Ingvaeonic languages ( including English ) , which arose from West Germanic dialects and remained in continued contact with North Germanic . A defining feature of Proto-Germanic is the completion of the process described by Grimm 's law , a set of sound changes that occurred between its status as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European and its gradual divergence into a separate language . As it is probable that the development of this sound shift spanned a considerable time ( several centuries ) , Proto-Germanic can not adequately be reconstructed as a simple node in a tree model but rather represents a phase of development that may span close to a thousand years . The end of the Common Germanic period is reached with the beginning of the Migration Period in the fourth century . The alternative term Germanic parent language may be used to include a larger scope of linguistic developments , spanning the Nordic Bronze Age and Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe ( second to first millennia BC ) to include Pre-Germanic ( PreGmc ) , Early Proto Germanic ( EPGmc ) and Late Proto-Germanic ( LPGmc ) . While Proto-Germanic refers only to the reconstruction of the most recent common ancestor of Germanic languages , the Germanic parent language refers to the entire journey that the dialect of Proto-Indo-European that would become Proto-Germanic underwent through the millennia . The Proto-Germanic language is not directly attested by any coherent surviving texts ; it has been reconstructed using the comparative method . Fragmentary direct attestation exists of ( late ) Common Germanic in early runic inscriptions ( specifically the second-century AD Vimose inscriptions and the second-century BC Negau helmet inscription ) , and in Roman Empire era transcriptions of individual words ( notably in Tacitus ' Germania , c. 90 CE ) .",

He then wrote runes on a piece of bark and touched her with it , causing her to go mad , and disguised himself as a medicine woman called Wecha , who was allowed to see her .

On Odin 's advice , the king tied Rinda to her bed , and Odin proceeded to rape her . From the rape was born V\u00e1li , who would later avenge Balderus .",

  "/wiki/\u00d3\u00f0r": "In Norse mythology , \u00d3\u00f0r ( Old Norse for the Divine Madness , frantic , furious , vehement , eager , as a noun mind , feeling and also song , poetry ; Orchard ( 1997 ) gives the frenzied one ) or \u00d3\u00f0 , sometimes anglicized as Odr or Od , is a figure associated with the major goddess Freyja . The Prose Edda and Heimskringla , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson , both describe \u00d3\u00f0r as Freyja 's husband and father of her daughter Hnoss . Heimskringla adds that the couple produced another daughter , Gersemi . A number of theories have been proposed about \u00d3\u00f0r , generally that he is a hypostasis of the deity Odin due to their similarities .",

The Old English form Seaxn\u0113at is recorded in the genealogies of the kings of Essex .

  "/wiki/Old_Saxon": "Old Saxon , also known as Old Low German , was a Germanic language and the earliest recorded form of Low German ( spoken nowadays in Northern Germany , the northeastern Netherlands , southern Denmark , the Americas and parts of Eastern Europe ) . It is a West Germanic language , closely related to the Anglo-Frisian languages . It is documented from the 8th century until the 12th century , when it gradually evolved into Middle Low German . It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany , primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern Netherlands by Saxons , a Germanic tribe who inhabited the region of Saxony . It partially shares Anglo-Frisian 's ( Old Frisian , Old English ) Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law which sets it apart from Low Franconian and Irminonic languages , such as Dutch , Luxembourgish and German . The grammar of Old Saxon was fully inflected with five grammatical cases ( nominative , accusative , genitive , dative , and instrumental ) , three grammatical numbers ( singular , plural , and dual ) and three grammatical genders ( masculine , feminine , and neuter ) . The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only and referred to groups of two . Historically , Old Saxon and Old Dutch were considered to be distinct dialects of an otherwise unitary language rather than two languages , primarily because they were linked through a dialect continuum spanning the modern Netherlands and Germany . However , while these two languages both shared the same historical origins and some very similar writing styles , Old Saxon shows a slightly reduced morphology compared to Old Dutch , which retained some grammatical distinctions that Old Saxon abandoned . There are also various differences in their phonological evolution , Old Saxon being classified as an Ingvaeonic language , whereas Old Dutch is one of the Istvaeonic languages ."
