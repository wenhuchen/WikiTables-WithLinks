  "/wiki/Call_to_the_Bar": "The call to the bar is a legal term of art in most common law jurisdictions where persons must be qualified to be allowed to argue in court on behalf of another party and are then said to have been called to the bar or to have received a call to the bar . The bar is now used as a collective noun for barristers , but literally referred to the wooden barrier in old courtrooms , which separated the often crowded public area at the rear from the space near the judges reserved for those having business with the Court . Barristers would sit or stand immediately behind it , facing the judge , and could use it as a table for their briefs . Like many other common law terms , the term originated in England in the Middle Ages , and the call to the bar refers to the summons issued to one found fit to speak at the 'bar ' of the royal courts . In time , English judges allowed only legally qualified men to address them on the law and later delegated the qualification and admission of barristers to the four Inns of Court . Once an Inn calls one of its members to its bar , they are thereafter a barrister . They may not , however , practise as a barrister until they have completed ( or been exempted from ) an apprenticeship called pupillage . After completing pupillage , they are considered to be a practising barrister with a right of audience before all courts . England and Wales and some other jurisdictions distinguish two types of lawyers , who are regulated by different bodies , with separate training , examinations , regulation and traditions :",
  "/wiki/Chief_Baron_of_the_Exchequer": "The Chief Baron of the Exchequer was the first baron ( i.e. , judge ) of the English Exchequer of Pleas . In the absence of both the Treasurer of the Exchequer or First Lord of the Treasury , and the Chancellor of the Exchequer , it was he who presided in the equity court and answered the bar i.e . spoke for the court . Practically speaking , he held the most important office of the Exchequer of Pleas . The chief baron , along with the three puisne barons , sat as a court of common law , heard suits in the court of equity , and settled revenue disputes . A puisne baron was styled Mr Baron X and the chief baron as Lord Chief Baron X . From 1550 to 1579 , there was a major distinction between the chief baron and the second , third and fourth puisne barons . The difference was in social status and education . All of the chief barons had been trained as lawyers in the inns of court . With the exception of Henry Bradshaw and Sir Clement Higham , both barristers-at-law , all of the chief barons who served Queen Elizabeth I , had attained the highest and most prestigious rank of a lawyer , serjeant-at-law . In 1875 , the Court of Exchequer became the Exchequer Division of the High Court . Following the death of the last chief baron in 1880 , the division and that of Common Pleas were merged into the Queen 's Bench Division .",

  "/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice_of_England_and_Wales": "The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales is the Head of the Judiciary of England and Wales and the President of the Courts of England and Wales . Historically , the officeholder was the second-highest judge of the Courts of England and Wales , after the Lord Chancellor , but became the top judge as a result of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 , which removed the judicial functions from the office of Lord Chancellor , altered the duties of the Lord Chief Justice and changed the relationship between the two offices . The Lord Chief Justice ordinarily serves as President of the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal and Head of Criminal Justice , but under the 2005 Act can appoint another judge to these positions . The Lord Chief Justice 's equivalent in Scotland is the Lord President of the Court of Session , who also holds the post of Lord Justice-General in the High Court of Justiciary . There is also a Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland , successor to the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland of the pre-Partition era . For the entire United Kingdom judiciary , there is a President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , though that court does not have final jurisdiction over Scottish criminal law . The current Lord Chief Justice is Lord Burnett of Maldon , who assumed the role on 2 October 2017 .",

  "/wiki/Court_of_King's_Bench_(England)": "The Court of King 's Bench ( or Court of Queen 's Bench during the reign of a female monarch ) , formally known as The Court of the King Before the King Himself , was an English court of common law in the English legal system . Created in the late 12th to early 13th century from the curia regis , the King 's Bench initially followed the monarch on his travels . The King 's Bench finally joined the Court of Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas in Westminster Hall in 1318 and making its last travels in 1421 . The King 's Bench was merged into the High Court of Justice by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 , after which point the King 's Bench was a division within the High Court . The King 's Bench was staffed by one Chief Justice ( now the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales ) and usually three Puisne Justices . In the 15th and 16th centuries , the King 's Bench 's jurisdiction and caseload was significantly challenged by the rise of the Court of Chancery and equitable doctrines as one of the two principal common law courts along with the Common Pleas . To recover , the King 's Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform , creating less expensive , faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form of bills as opposed to the more traditional writs . Although not immediately stemming the tide , it helped the King 's Bench to recover and increase its workload in the long term . While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540 , as the new reforms began to take effect the King 's Bench 's business was significantly boosted ; between 1560 and 1640 , it rose tenfold . The Common Pleas became suspicious of the new developments , as legal fictions such as the Bill of Middlesex damaged its own business . Fighting against the King 's Bench in a reactionary and increasingly conservative way , an equilibrium was eventually reached in the 17th century until the merger in 1873 . The King 's Bench 's jurisdiction initially covered a wide range of criminal matters , any business not claimed by the other courts , and any cases concerning the monarch .",

  "/wiki/Thomas_Bryan_(Chief_Justice)": "Sir Thomas Bryan I KS KB ( died 14 August 1500 ) was a British justice . He married Margaret Bowsey . He was born to the son of William John Bryan Briennie , of the House of Bryan ( de Brienne ) , although Thomas assumed the arms of Guy De Bryan when he became a person of some importance . It is suggested he went to university before beginning legal studies in the 1440s , becoming a student at Gray 's Inn , progressing rapidly ; by 1456 he was already a Bencher , and was acting as a Feoffee for the Inn . He was at this point serving as legal counsel for various London companies , including as a steward for St Bartholomew 's Hospital in 1459 . He was appointed Common Serjeant of London in 1460 , a position he held until he was created Serjeant-at-law in 1463 , followed by a further promotion to King 's Serjeant in 1470 .

  "/wiki/Timothy_Turner": "Sir Timothy Turner SL JP ( 11 July 1585 - January 1677 ) was an English judge . Turner was the eldest son of the Shropshire barrister Thomas Turner . He was a member of Staple Inn and then joined Gray 's Inn on 8 March 1607 , being called to the bar on 30 October 1611 . In the contemporary debates between Sir Edward Coke and Lord Chancellor Ellesmere , Turner 's notebooks reveal him to have felt a strong reaction against Ellesmere 's claims for the royal prerogative as transcendent to the common law . His initial practice was centered on Ludlow , the legal center of Wales and the Marches , but he was of little note officially until 1626 , when he became a justice of the peace for Shropshire , through the influence either of Sir Thomas Coventry , or Ellesmere 's son and heir the Earl of Bridgewater . ( Turner 's second wife was the widow of Bridgewater 's late solicitor . ) A commissioner in Shropshire for the forced loan of 1626 , Turner was subsequently king 's solicitor before the Council of the Marches from 1627 to 1637 , and a master in chancery extraordinary from 1630 . He became a bencher of Gray 's Inn in 1632 . His first judicial appointment came in 1634 , when he was made puisne judge for the North Wales circuit , and in 1637 , became chief justice of South Wales . He became recorder of Shrewsbury in 1638 . In 1642 , it was reported to the House of Commons that Turner and the mayor of Shrewsbury had placed a declaration before the grand jury which declared the Commissions of Array legitimate and included a promise to defend the King as well as the laws and privileges of Parliament . While Turner later claimed that he had been forced to take this position due to the strength of the Royalist party in Shropshire - and several members of his household , including his son , joined the Parliamentary cause - he was stripped of his offices by the end of 1645 and forced to compound with Parliament .",
  "/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Chester": "The Justice of Chester was the chief judicial authority for the county palatine of Chester , from the establishment of the county until the abolition of the Great Sessions in Wales and the palatine judicature in 1830 . Within the County Palatine ( which encompassed Cheshire , the City of Chester , and Flintshire ) , the Justice enjoyed the jurisdiction possessed in England by the Court of Common Pleas and the King 's Bench . While the legal reorganisation of Wales and the Marches under Henry VIII diminished the authority of the Earl of Chester ( i.e. , the Prince of Wales ) in the County Palatine , the authority of the Justice was , in fact , increased . In 1542 , the Great Sessions were established in Wales , that country being divided into four circuits of three shires each . Denbighshire , Flintshire , and Montgomeryshire were made part of the Chester circuit , over which the Justice presided . Under Elizabeth I , a second justice was added to each of the Welsh circuits , after which the senior and junior justice are generally referred to as the Chief Justice of Chester and the Second or Puisne Justice of Chester . Because the Cheshire justices were free to practise as barristers in the English courts or sit in Parliament , the post of Chief Justice was often awarded as a form of patronage by the Government to aspiring lawyers . The offices of Chief and Puisne Justice were abolished in 1830 , as part of reforms that also brought Wales under the jurisdiction of the courts at Westminster .",

Charles was born into the House of Stuart as the second son of King James VI of Scotland , but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603 ( as James I ) , he moved to England , where he spent much of the rest of his life . He became heir apparent to the three kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland in 1612 on the death of his elder brother Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations . Two years later he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France . After his succession in 1625 , Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England , which sought to curb his royal prerogative . Charles believed in the divine right of kings , and was determined to govern according to his own conscience . Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of Reformed groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters , who thought his views were too Catholic . He supported high church Anglican ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments , and helped precipitate his own downfall . From 1642 , Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War .",
