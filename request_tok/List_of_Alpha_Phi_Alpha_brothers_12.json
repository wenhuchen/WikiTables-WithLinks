Emerging in 1960 from the student-led sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Greensboro , North Carolina and Nashville , Tennessee , the Committee sought to coordinate and assist direct-action challenges to the civic segregation and political exclusion of African-Americans . From 1962 , with the support of the Voter Education Project , SNCC committed to the registration and mobilization of black voters in the Deep South . Affiliates such as the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in Alabama increased dramatically the pressure on federal and state government to enforce constitutional protections . But by the mid-1960s the measured nature of the gains made , and the violence with which they were resisted , were generating dissent from the principles of non-violence , of white participation in the movement , and of field-driven , as opposed to national-office , leadership and direction . At the same time organizers were being lost to a de-segregating Democratic Party and to federally-funded anti-poverty programs . Following an aborted merger with the Black Panther Party in 1968 , SNCC effectively dissolved . SNCC is nonetheless credited in its brief existence with breaking down barriers , both institutional and psychological , to the empowerment of African-American communities .
