A partnership between Popular Arts , Tom Snyder Productions and Jonathan Katz was formed , and thus , Dr. Katz , Professional Therapist was born .",

She is one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs . While the place of her birth is not yet identified , she was married in London in 1633 to the milliner William Dyer . Mary and William were Puritans who were interested in reforming the Anglican Church from within , without separating from it . As the English king increased pressure on the Puritans , they left England by the thousands to go to New England in the early 1630s . Mary and William arrived in Boston by 1635 , joining the Boston Church in December of that year . Like most members of Boston 's church , they soon became involved in the Antinomian Controversy , a theological crisis lasting from 1636 to 1638 . Mary and William were strong advocates of Anne Hutchinson and John Wheelwright in the controversy , and as a result , Mary 's husband was disenfranchised and disarmed for supporting these heretics and also for harboring his own heretical views . Subsequently , they left Massachusetts with many others to establish a new colony on Aquidneck Island ( later Rhode Island ) in Narraganset Bay . Before leaving Boston , Mary had given birth to a severely deformed infant that was stillborn . Because of the theological implications of such a birth , the baby was buried secretly . When the Massachusetts authorities learned of this birth , the ordeal became public , and in the minds of the colony 's ministers and magistrates , the monstrous birth was clearly a result of Mary 's monstrous religious opinions .",
