Like certain other upper houses of state and territorial legislatures and the federal U.S. Senate , the State Senate can confirm or reject gubernatorial appointments to state departments , commissions , boards , and other state governmental agencies . The current Senate President is Peter Courtney of Salem . Oregon , along with Arizona , Maine , and Wyoming , is one of the four U.S. states to not have the Office of the Lieutenant Governor , a position which for most upper houses of state legislatures and indeed for the U.S. Congress ( with the Vice President ) is the head of the legislative body and holder of the casting vote in the event of a tie . Instead , a separate position of Senate President is in place , removed from the state executive branch . If the chamber is tied , legislators must devise their own methods of resolving the impasse . In 2002 , for example , Oregon 's state senators entered into a power sharing contract whereby Democratic senators nominated the Senate President while Republican senators chaired key committees ."
