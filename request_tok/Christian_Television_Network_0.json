  "/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina": "Charleston is the oldest and largest city in the U.S. state of South Carolina . The city is the county seat of Charleston County , and the principal city in the Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville Metropolitan Statistical Area . The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of South Carolina 's coastline and is located on Charleston Harbor , an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean formed by the confluence of the Ashley , Cooper , and Wando rivers . Charleston had an estimated population of 136,208 in 2018 . The estimated population of the Charleston metropolitan area , comprising Berkeley , Charleston , and Dorchester counties , was 787,643 residents as of 2018 , the third-largest in the state and the 78th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States . Charleston was founded in 1670 as Charles Town , honoring King Charles II of England . Its initial location at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley River ( now Charles Towne Landing ) was abandoned in 1680 for its present site , which became the fifth-largest city in North America within ten years . One of the key cities in the British colonization of the Americas , Charles Town played a major role in the slave trade , which laid the foundation for the city 's size and wealth , and was dominated by a slavocracy of plantation owners and slave traders . Independent Charleston slave traders like Joseph Wragg were the first to break through the monopoly of the Royal African Company , pioneering the large-scale slave trade of the 18th century . Historians estimate that nearly half of all Africans brought to America arrived in Charleston , most at Gadsden 's Wharf . Despite its size , it remained unincorporated throughout the colonial period ; its government was handled directly by a colonial legislature and a governor sent by London , England . Election districts were organized according to Anglican parishes , and some social services were managed by Anglican wardens and vestries .",

The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population ."
