  "/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature": "Binomial nomenclature ( two-term naming system ) , also called binominal nomenclature ( two-name naming system ) or binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts , both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages . Such a name is called a binomial name ( which may be shortened to just binomial ) , a binomen , binominal name or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name - the generic name - identifies the genus to which the species belongs , while the second part - the specific name or specific epithet - identifies the species within the genus . For example , humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . Tyrannosaurus rex is probably the most widely known binomial . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753 . But Gaspard Bauhin , in as early as 1622 , had introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici ( English , Illustrated exposition of plants ) many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus . The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules , of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICNafp ) . Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes , there are some differences , both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules . In modern usage , the first letter of the first part of the name , the genus , is always capitalized in writing , while that of the second part is not , even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place . Similarly , both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text ( or underlined in handwriting ) . Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox ( named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii .",
  "/wiki/Population_biology": "Population biology is an interdisciplinary field combining the areas of ecology and evolutionary biology . Population biology draws on tools from mathematics , statistics , genomics , genetics , and systematics . Population biologists study allele frequency changes ( evolution ) within populations of the same species ( population genetics ) , and interactions between populations of different species ( ecology ) .",
  "/wiki/Conservation_status": "The conservation status of a group of organisms ( for instance , a species ) indicates whether the group still exists and how likely the group is to become extinct in the near future . Many factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status : not simply the number of individuals remaining , but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time , breeding success rates , and known threats . Various systems of conservation status exist and are in use at international , multi-country , national and local levels as well as for consumer use .",
  "/wiki/Junin_grebe": "The Jun\u00edn grebe ( Podiceps taczanowskii ) , also known as Junin flightless grebe or puna grebe , is a grebe found only on Lake Junin in the highlands of Jun\u00edn , west-central Peru . The grebe generally breeds in bays and channels around the edge of the Lake , within 8-75 m ( 26-246 ft ) of reed beds , entering the reeds only for nesting or roosting . When not breeding , Junin grebe prefer open water , moving far out from lake shores . The current population is estimated at less than 250 . The scientific name commemorates the Polish zoologist W\u0142adys\u0142aw Taczanowski , author of Ornithology of Peru ( 1884-86 ) . Another highly endangered species , the Junin rail , is restricted to the same lake .",
  "/wiki/Critically_endangered": "A critically endangered ( CR ) species is one that has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild . As of 2014 , there are 2,464 animal and 2,104 plant species with this assessment . As the IUCN Red List does not consider a species extinct until extensive , targeted surveys have been conducted , species that are possibly extinct are still listed as critically endangered . IUCN maintains a list of possibly extinct CR ( PE ) and possibly extinct in the wild CR ( PEW ) species , modelled on categories used by BirdLife International to categorize these taxa .",
  "/wiki/Hooded_grebe": "The hooded grebe ( Podiceps gallardoi ) , is a medium-sized grebe found in the southern region of Argentina . It grows to about 32 cm ( 13 in ) in length , and is black and white in color . It is found in isolated lakes in the most remote parts of Patagonia and spends winters along the coast of the same region . In 2012 IUCN uplisted the species from Endangered to Critically Endangered .",
  "/wiki/New_Zealand_grebe": "The New Zealand grebe , New Zealand dabchick , or weweia ( Poliocephalus rufopectus ) is a member of the grebe family endemic to New Zealand .",
  "/wiki/Vulnerable_species": "A vulnerable species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as likely to become endangered unless the circumstances that are threatening its survival and reproduction improve . Vulnerability is mainly caused by habitat loss or destruction of the species home . Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened . Some species listed as vulnerable may be common in captivity , an example being the military macaw . There are currently 5196 animals and 6789 plants classified as vulnerable , compared with 1998 levels of 2815 and 3222 , respectively . Practices such as Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources have been enforced in efforts to conserve vulnerable breeds of livestock specifically .",
  "/wiki/Madagascar_grebe": "The Madagascan grebe ( Tachybaptus pelzelnii ) is a grebe found only in western and central Madagascar . The binomial name commemorates the Austrian ornithologist August von Pelzeln . It is classified as endangered by the IUCN , with a population of less than 5,000 . It is threatened by habitat loss , predation by carnivorous fish , and competition with introduced species .",
  "/wiki/Clark's_grebe": "Clark 's grebe ( Aechmophorus clarkii ) is a North American waterbird species in the grebe family . Until the 1980s , it was thought to be a pale morph of the western grebe , which it resembles in size , range , and behavior . Intermediates between the two species are known . This species nests on large inland lakes in western North America and migrates to the Pacific coast over the winter . It maintains local populations year-round in California , Nevada , and Arizona ( the Lower Colorado River Valley ) , as well as in central Mexico . It feeds by diving for insects , polychaete worms , crustaceans , and salamanders . It performs the same elaborate courtship display as the western grebe .",
  "/wiki/Least_concern": "A least concern species is a species that has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as evaluated as not being a focus of species conservation . They do not qualify as threatened , near threatened , or ( before 2001 ) conservation dependent . Species can not be assigned the Least Concern category unless they have had their population status evaluated . That is , adequate information is needed to make a direct , or indirect , assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution or population status . Since 2001 the category has had the abbreviation LC , following the IUCN 2001 Categories & Criteria ( version 3.1 ) . However , around 20% of least concern taxa ( 3261 of 15636 ) in the IUCN database use the code LR/lc , which indicates they have not been re-evaluated since 2000 . Before 2001 least concern was a subcategory of the Lower Risk category and assigned the code LR/lc or lc . While least concern is not considered a red listed category by the IUCN , the 2006 IUCN Red List still assigns the category to 15636 taxa . The number of animal species listed in this category totals 14033 ( which includes several undescribed species such as a frog from the genus Philautus ) . There are also 101 animal subspecies listed and 1500 plant taxa ( 1410 species , 55 subspecies , and 35 varieties ) . There are also two animal subpopulations listed : the Australasian and Southern African subpopulations of spiny dogfish . No fungi or protista have the classification , though only four species in those kingdoms have been evaluated by the IUCN .",
  "/wiki/Western_grebe": "The western grebe ( Aechmophorus occidentalis ) is a species in the grebe family of water birds . Folk names include dabchick , swan grebe and swan-necked grebe . Western grebe fossils from the Late Pleistocene of SW North America were described as a distinct species , but later ranked as a paleosubspecies Aechmophorus occidentalis lucasi . More recent study found them to fall within the variation now known to exist in today 's birds .",
  "/wiki/Horned_grebe": "The horned grebe or Slavonian grebe ( Podiceps auritus ) is a relatively small waterbird in the family Podicipedidae . There are two known subspecies : P. a. auritus , which breeds in Eurasia , and P. a. cornutus , which breeds in North America . The Eurasian subspecies is distributed over most of northern Europe and Asia , breeding from Greenland to western China . The North American subspecies spans most of Canada and some of the United States . The species got its name from large patches of yellowish feathers located behind the eyes , called horns , that the birds can raise and lower at will .",
  "/wiki/Red-necked_grebe": "The red-necked grebe ( Podiceps grisegena ) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere . Its wintering habitat is largely restricted to calm waters just beyond the waves around ocean coasts , although some birds may winter on large lakes . Grebes prefer shallow bodies of fresh water such as lakes , marshes or fish-ponds as breeding sites . The red-necked grebe is a nondescript dusky-grey bird in winter . During the breeding season , it acquires the distinctive red neck plumage , black cap and contrasting pale grey face from which its name was derived . It also has an elaborate courtship display and a variety of loud mating calls . Once paired , it builds a nest from water plants on top of floating vegetation in a shallow lake or bog . Like all grebes , the Red-necked is a good swimmer , a particularly swift diver , and responds to danger by diving rather than flying . The feet are positioned far back on the body , near the tail , which makes the bird ungainly on land . It dives for fish or picks insects off vegetation ; it also swallows its own feathers , possibly to protect the digestive system . The conservation status of its two subspecies - P. g. grisegena found in Europe and western Asia , and the larger P. g. holboelii ( formerly Holb\u0153ll grebe ) , in North America and eastern Siberia - is evaluated as Least Concern , and the global population is stable or growing .",
  "/wiki/Little_grebe": "The little grebe ( Tachybaptus ruficollis ) , also known as dabchick , is a member of the grebe family of water birds . The genus name is from Ancient Greek takhus fast and bapto to sink under . The specific ruficollis is from Latin rufus red and Modern Latin -collis , -necked , itself derived from Latin collum neck . At 23 to 29 cm ( 9.1 to 11.4 in ) in length it is the smallest European member of its family . It is commonly found in open bodies of water across most of its range .",
  "/wiki/Great_crested_grebe": "The great crested grebe ( Podiceps cristatus ) is a member of the grebe family of water birds noted for its elaborate mating display . Its scientific name comes from Latin : the genus name Podiceps is from podicis , vent and pes , foot , and is a reference to the placement of a grebe 's legs towards the rear of its body ; the species name , cristatus , means crested .",
  "/wiki/Black-necked_grebe": "The black-necked grebe ( Podiceps nigricollis ) , known in North America as the eared grebe , is a member of the grebe family of water birds . It was described in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm . There are currently three accepted subspecies , including the nominate subspecies . Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage which extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts . The rest of the upper parts , including the head , neck , and breast , are coloured black to blackish brown . The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut , and the abdomen is white . When in its non-breeding plumage , this bird has greyish-black upper parts , including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck . The flanks are also greyish-black . The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour . The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas . The subspecies californicus can be distinguished from the nominate by the former 's usually longer bill . The other subspecies , P. n. gurneyi , can be differentiated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its smaller size ."
