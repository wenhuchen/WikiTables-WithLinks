  "/wiki/Fern": "A fern ( Polypodiopsida or Polypodiophyta ) is a member of a group of vascular plants ( plants with xylem and phloem ) that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers . They differ from mosses by being vascular , i.e. , having specialized tissues that conduct water and nutrients and in having life cycles in which the sporophyte is the dominant phase . Ferns have complex leaves called megaphylls , that are more complex than the microphylls of clubmosses . Most ferns are leptosporangiate ferns , sometimes referred to as true ferns . They produce coiled fiddleheads that uncoil and expand into fronds . The group includes about 10,560 known extant species . Ferns are defined here in the broad sense , being all of the Polypodiopsida , comprising both the leptosporangiate ( Polypodiidae ) and eusporangiate ferns , the latter itself comprising ferns other than those denominated true ferns , including horsetails or scouring rushes , whisk ferns , marattioid ferns , and ophioglossoid ferns . Ferns first appear in the fossil record about 360 million years ago in the middle Devonian period , but many of the current families and species did not appear until roughly 145 million years ago in the early Cretaceous , after flowering plants came to dominate many environments . The fern Osmunda claytoniana is a paramount example of evolutionary stasis ; paleontological evidence indicates it has remained unchanged , even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes , for at least 180 million years . Ferns are not of major economic importance , but some are used for food , medicine , as biofertilizer , as ornamental plants and for remediating contaminated soil . They have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the atmosphere . Some fern species , such as bracken ( Pteridium aquilinum ) and water fern ( Azolla filiculoides ) are significant weeds worldwide .",

  "/wiki/Cretaceous": "The Cretaceous ( /kr\u026a\u02c8te\u026a.\u0283\u0259s/ , krih-TAY-sh\u0259s ) is a geological period that lasted from about 145 to 66 million years ago ( mya ) . It is the third and final period of the Mesozoic Era . The name is derived from the Latin creta . It is usually abbreviated K , for its German translation Kreide . The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate , resulting in high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas . These oceans and seas were populated with now-extinct marine reptiles , ammonites and rudists , while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land . During this time , new groups of mammals and birds , as well as flowering plants , appeared . The Cretaceous ( along with the Mesozoic ) ended with the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event , a large mass extinction in which many groups , including non-avian dinosaurs , pterosaurs and large marine reptiles died out . The end of the Cretaceous is defined by the abrupt Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary ( K-Pg boundary ) , a geologic signature associated with the mass extinction which lies between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras .",
  "/wiki/Fossil": "A fossil ( from Classical Latin : Fossilis ; literally means : obtained by digging ) is any preserved remains , impression , or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age . Examples include bones , shells , exoskeletons , stone imprints of animals or microbes , objects preserved in amber , hair , petrified wood , oil , coal , and DNA remnants . The totality of fossils is known as the fossil record . Paleontology is the study of fossils : their age , method of formation , and evolutionary significance . Specimens are usually considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000 years old . The oldest fossils are around 3.48 billion years old to 4.1 billion years old . The observation in the 19th century that certain fossils were associated with certain rock strata led to the recognition of a geological timescale and the relative ages of different fossils . The development of radiometric dating techniques in the early 20th century allowed scientists to quantitatively measure the absolute ages of rocks and the fossils they host . There are many processes that lead to fossilization , including permineralization , casts and molds , authigenic mineralization , replacement and recrystallization , adpression , carbonization , and bioimmuration . Fossils vary in size from one-micrometre ( 1 \u00b5m ) bacteria to dinosaurs and trees , many meters long and weighing many tons . A fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism , usually that portion that was partially mineralized during life , such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates , or the chitinous or calcareous exoskeletons of invertebrates . Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive , such as animal tracks or feces ( coprolites ) .",
  "/wiki/Miocene": "The Miocene ( /\u02c8ma\u026a.\u0259\u02ccsi\u02d0n , \u02c8ma\u026a.o\u028a-/ MY-\u0259-seen , MY-oh- ) is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago ( Ma ) . The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell ; its name comes from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ( mei\u014dn , less ) and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ( kainos , new ) and means less recent because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene . The Miocene is preceded by the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene . As the earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene , the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages . The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regionally defined boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch . The apes first evolved , arose , and diversified during the early Miocene ( Aquitanian and Burdigalian stages ) , becoming widespread in the Old World . By the end of this epoch and the start of the following one , the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path during the final Messinian stage ( 7.5-5.3 Ma ) of the Miocene . As in the Oligocene before it , grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent . In the seas of the Miocene , kelp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of Earth 's most productive ecosystems . The plants and animals of the Miocene were recognizably modern . Mammals and birds were well-established . Whales , pinnipeds , and kelp spread .",

It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era . The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch . Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale , which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene , the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage , which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago , and is now included in the Pleistocene . As with other older geologic periods , the geological strata that define the start and end are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain . The boundaries defining the Pliocene are not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer Miocene and the relatively cooler Pliocene . The upper boundary was set at the start of the Pleistocene glaciations .",

The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology . The Pleistocene is the first epoch of the Quaternary Period or sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era . In the ICS timescale , the Pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages , the Gelasian , Calabrian , Chibanian , and Upper Pleistocene ( unofficially the Tarantian ) . [ note 1 ] In addition to these international subdivisions , various regional subdivisions are often used . Before a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the International Union of Geological Sciences , the time boundary between the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene was regarded as being at 1.806 million years Before Present ( BP ) , as opposed to the currently accepted 2.58 million years BP .

  "/wiki/Continental_shelf": "A continental shelf is a portion of a continent that is submerged under an area of relatively shallow water known as a shelf sea . Much of these shelves has been exposed during glacial periods and interglacial periods . The shelf surrounding an island is known as an insular shelf . The continental margin , between the continental shelf and the abyssal plain , comprises a steep continental slope , surrounded by the flatter continental rise , in which sediment from the continent above cascades down the slope and accumulates as a pile of sediment at the base of the slope . Extending as far as 500 km ( 310 mi ) from the slope , it consists of thick sediments deposited by turbidity currents from the shelf and slope . The continental rise 's gradient is intermediate between the gradients of the slope and the shelf . Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , the name continental shelf was given a legal definition as the stretch of the seabed adjacent to the shores of a particular country to which it belongs .",

They were a loose confederation of several tribes in the 17th century , but today Wampanoag people encompass five officially recognized tribes . The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head in Massachusetts are Federally recognized , and the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe , Namasket ( or Nemasket ) Pokanoket Band , and Pocasset Wampanoag Tribe ( Pokonoket ) are recognized by the State of Massachusetts . They lived in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the beginning of the 17th century , at the time of first contact with the English colonists , a territory that included the islands of Martha 's Vineyard and Nantucket . Their population numbered in the thousands ; 3,000 Wampanoag lived on Martha 's Vineyard alone . From 1615 to 1619 , the Wampanoag suffered an epidemic , long suspected to be smallpox . Modern research , however , has suggested that it may have been leptospirosis , a bacterial infection which can develop into Weil 's syndrome . It caused a high fatality rate and decimated the Wampanoag population . Researchers suggest that the losses from the epidemic were so large that colonists were able to establish their settlements in the Massachusetts Bay Colony more easily . More than 50 years later , King Philip 's War ( 1675-1676 ) of Indian allies against the colonists resulted in the death of 40 percent of the surviving tribe . Many male Wampanoag were sold into slavery in Bermuda or the West Indies , and some women and children were enslaved by colonists in New England . The tribe largely disappeared from historical records after the late 18th century , although its people and descendants persisted .",
