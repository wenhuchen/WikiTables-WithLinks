The battle represented the most intense phase of the Japanese invasion of the Philippines during World War II . In January 1942 , forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy invaded Luzon along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor . The commander-in-chief of all U.S. and Filipino forces in the islands , General Douglas MacArthur , consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the Bataan Peninsula to fight against the Japanese army . By this time , the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia . The Bataan Peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region . Despite a lack of supplies , American and Filipino forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months , engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward . As the combined American and Filipino forces made a last stand , the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific . The American surrender at Bataan to the Japanese , with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether , was the largest in American and Filipino military histories , and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War 's Battle of Harper 's Ferry .

A staunch royalist , he retreated to the mountains near Belgrade when the Germans overran Yugoslavia in April 1941 and there he organized bands of guerrillas known as the Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army . The organisation is commonly known as the Chetniks , although the name of the organisation was later changed to the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland ( JVUO , \u0408\u0412\u0423\u041e ) . Founded as the first Yugoslav resistance movement , it was royalist and nationalist , as opposed to the other , Josip Broz Tito 's Partisans who were communist .

They also engaged in tactical or selective collaboration with the occupying forces for almost all of the war . The Mihailovi\u0107 Chetniks were not a homogeneous movement . The Chetnik movement adopted a policy of collaboration with regard to the Axis , and engaged in cooperation to one degree or another by establishing modus vivendi or operating as legalised auxiliary forces under Axis control . Over a period of time , and in different parts of the country , the Chetnik movement was progressively drawn into collaboration agreements : first with the puppet Government of National Salvation in the German-occupied territory of Serbia , then with the Italians in occupied Dalmatia and Montenegro , with some of the Usta\u0161e forces in northern Bosnia , and , after the Italian capitulation , with the Germans directly . The Chetniks were active in uprising against the German occupiers throughout 1941 . Following the success of the Battle of Loznica , Mihailovi\u0107 's Chetniks were the first to liberate a European city from Axis control . Following this , German occupiers enacted Adolf Hitler 's formula for suppressing anti-Nazi resistance in Eastern Europe , a ratio of 100 hostages executed for every German soldier killed and 50 hostages executed for every soldier wounded . In October 1941 , German soldiers conducted two mass murder campaigns against Serbian civilians in Kraljevo and Kragujevac , with a combined death toll reaching over 4,500 civilians , convincing Chetnik leader Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 that killing German troops would only result in further unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs . As a result , he decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans . While Chetnik collaboration reached extensive and systematic proportions , the Chetniks themselves referred to their policy of collaboration as using the enemy . Sabrina Ramet , a political scientist , has observed , Both the Chetniks ' political program and the extent of their collaboration have been amply , even voluminously , documented ; it is more than a bit disappointing , thus , that people can still be found who believe that the Chetniks were doing anything besides attempting to realize a vision of an ethnically homogeneous Greater Serbian state , which they intended to advance , in the short run , by a policy of collaboration with the Axis forces .",

At the beginning of 1944 , the western half of the Winter Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido-Gari , Liri and Garigliano valleys and some of the surrounding peaks and ridges . Together , these features formed the Gustav Line . Monte Cassino , a historic hilltop abbey founded in AD 529 by Benedict of Nursia , dominated the nearby town of Cassino and the entrances to the Liri and Rapido valleys . Lying in a protected historic zone , it had been left unoccupied by the Germans , although they manned some positions set into the steep slopes below the abbey 's walls . Repeated pinpoint artillery attacks on Allied assault troops caused their leaders to conclude the abbey was being used by the Germans as an observation post , at the very least . Fears escalated along with casualties and in spite of a lack of clear evidence , it was marked for destruction . On 15 February American bombers dropped 1,400 tons of high explosives , creating widespread damage . The raid failed to achieve its objective , as German paratroopers then occupied the rubble and established excellent defensive positions amid the ruins .

Of the first monastery almost nothing is known . The second monastery was established by Petronax of Brescia around 718 , at the suggestion of Pope Gregory II and with the support of the Lombard Duke Romuald II of Benevento . It was directly subject to the pope and many monasteries in Italy were under its authority . In 883 the monastery was sacked by Saracens and abandoned again . The community of monks resided first at Teano and then from 914 at Capua before the monastery was rebuilt in 949 . During the period of exile , the Cluniac Reforms were introduced into the community . The 11th and 12th centuries were the abbey 's golden age .

  "/wiki/Operation_Biting": "Operation Biting , also known as the Bruneval Raid , was a British Combined Operations raid on a German coastal radar installation at Bruneval in northern France during the Second World War , on the night of 27-28 February 1942 . Several of these installations were identified from Royal Air Force ( RAF ) aerial reconnaissance photographs during 1941 , but their exact purpose and the nature of the equipment that they possessed was not known . Some British scientists believed that these stations were connected with the heavy losses being experienced by RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe . The scientists requested that one of these installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and , if possible , extracted and brought back to Britain for further examination . Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the installation from a seaborne raid , it was believed that a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the enemy to destroy the installation . It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation , seize the technology intact , and minimise casualties to the raiding force . On the night of 27 February , after a period of intense training and several delays due to poor weather , a company of airborne troops under the command of Major John Frost parachuted into France a few miles from the installation . The main force then assaulted the villa in which the radar equipment was kept , killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief firefight . An RAF technician with the force dismantled a W\u00fcrzburg radar array and removed several key pieces , after which the force withdrew to the evacuation beach . The detachment assigned to clear the beach had initially failed to do so , but the German force guarding it was soon eliminated with the help of the main force . The raiding troops were picked up by landing craft , then transferred to several Motor Gun Boats which returned them to Britain . The raid was entirely successful ."
