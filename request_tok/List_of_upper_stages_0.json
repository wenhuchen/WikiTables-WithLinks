  "/wiki/RM-81_Agena": "The RM-81 Agena was an American rocket upper stage and satellite bus which was developed by Lockheed initially for the canceled WS-117L reconnaissance satellite program . Following the split-up of WS-117L into SAMOS and Corona for image intelligence , and MIDAS for early warning , the Agena was later used as an upper stage , and an integrated component , for several programs , including Corona reconnaissance satellites and the Agena Target Vehicle used to demonstrate rendezvous and docking during Project Gemini . It was used as an upper stage on the Atlas , Thor , Thorad and Titan IIIB rockets , and considered for others including the Space Shuttle and Atlas V. A total of 365 Agena rockets were launched between February 28 , 1959 and February 1987 . Only 33 Agenas carried NASA payloads and the vast majority were for DoD programs . On some missions , the payload was built directly into the Agena , which provided it with electric power , communications and three-axis stabilization . Payload components were usually located ahead of the Agena 's standard bulkhead . On missions where the payload was not built into the Agena , and instead separated after launch , the Agena was known as an Ascent Agena . The Agena was upgraded twice from the original Agena A in order to support heavier and more sophisticated satellites , such as Corona spacecraft with multiple and more powerful cameras . The Agena name was suggested by the Department of Defense 's Advanced Research Projects Agency for the star Beta Centauri , also known as Agena , because this upper stage would ignite in the sky . This followed Lockheed 's tradition of naming products for stellar phenomena . The final launch was of an Agena D on February 12 , 1987 , configured as the upper stage of a Titan 34B . In all , 365 Agena vehicles were launched by NASA and the US Air Force .",

[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Atlas-Agena": "The Atlas-Agena was an American expendable launch system derived from the SM-65 Atlas missile . It was a member of the Atlas family of rockets , and was launched 109 times between 1960 and 1978 . It was used to launch the first five Mariner uncrewed probes to the planets Venus and Mars , and the Ranger and Lunar Orbiter uncrewed probes to the Moon . The upper stage was also used as an uncrewed orbital target vehicle for the Gemini crewed spacecraft to practice rendezvous and docking . However , the launch vehicle family was originally developed for the Air Force and most of its launches were classified DoD payloads . The Atlas-Agena was a two-and-a-half-stage rocket , with a stage-and-a-half Atlas missile as the first stage , and an RM-81 Agena second stage . Initially , Atlas D missiles , redesignated as the LV-3 , were used as the first stage . These were later replaced by the standardized Atlas SLV-3 , and its derivatives , the SLV-3A and B . The final Atlas-Agena launch used an Atlas E/F . The earliest Agena variant was the Agena A in 1959-60 , which did not have restart capability . Most of these were flown on Thor-Agena boosters for the Discoverer program and only four used Atlases ( Midas 1 , Midas 2 , Samos 1 , and Samos 2 ) , two of which failed . Late in 1960 , Lockheed introduced the uprated Agena B stage which was restartable and had longer propellant tanks for more burn time .",

The first successful launch was on February 28 , 1959 , launching Discoverer 1 .",
  "/wiki/Thorad-Agena": "The Thorad-Agena was an American expendable launch system , derived from the Thor and Delta rockets . The first stage of the rocket was a stretched Thor variant named Long Tank Thrust Augmented Thor . The Long Tank Thor first stage was later adopted by NASA 's Delta program for its Thrust Augmented Improved Delta , which first flew in 1968 . The second stage was the Agena-D , which had already been used in conjunction with the standard configuration Thor , as the Thor-Agena . Three Castor rockets would be used as boosters . Most launches carried Corona ( KeyHole ) reconnaissance satellites , particularly spacecraft of the KH-4 series , however some scientific and technology development satellites were also flown , mostly towards the end of the program . 43 launches took place from 1966-72 with two complete failures and one partial . The launch of a KH-4A photoreconnaissance satellite on May 9 , 1967 , malfunctioned when the Thor 's first stage failed to cut off on schedule and continued burning until LOX depletion , thus putting the satellite into an incorrect orbit that seriously reduced its image quality . The first total failure was the launch of a Nimbus weather satellite on May 5 , 1968 , when control of the Thor failed during launch and it was destroyed by Range Safety action at T+120 seconds . This mission was noteworthy because the satellite carried a pair of isotopic power generators known as SNAP ( Systems For Nuclear Auxiliary Power ) . As the possibility of a launch failure had been considered during their design , the power generators were equipped with a very sturdy casing to prevent their radioactive contents from escaping into the environment . After the destruction of Nimbus-B 's launch vehicle , Navy crews began an extensive search for the SNAP generators .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

The N1 was the Soviet counterpart to the US Saturn V and was intended to enable crewed travel to Earth 's Moon and beyond , with studies beginning as early as 1959 . Its first stage remains the most powerful rocket stage ever built , but all of the four flown N1 Block A first stages failed because of lack of static test firing which did not reveal plumbing issues and other adverse characteristics with the large cluster of thirty engines and its complex fuel and oxidiser feeder system . The N1-L3 version was designed to compete with the United States Apollo program to land a person on the Moon , using a similar lunar orbit rendezvous method . The basic N1 launch vehicle had three stages , which were to carry the L3 lunar payload into low Earth orbit with two cosmonauts . The L3 contained one stage for trans-lunar injection ; another stage used for mid-course corrections , lunar orbit insertion , and the first part of the descent to the lunar surface ; a single-pilot LK Lander spacecraft ; and a two-pilot Soyuz 7K-LOK lunar orbital spacecraft for return to Earth . N1-L3 was underfunded and rushed , starting development in October 1965 , almost four years after the Saturn V. The project was badly derailed by the death of its chief designer Sergei Korolev in 1966 . Each of the four attempts to launch an N1 failed , with the second attempt resulting in the vehicle crashing back onto its launch pad shortly after liftoff and causing one of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions in human history .

Three have been launched , the first in December 2010 ; the first two launches failed before fourth stage ignition , the first as a result of a problem with the Blok DM 's fuel load . Initial versions of the Blok DM-03 are powered by a single RD-58M engine , fueled by RG-1 and oxidised by liquid oxygen . The last evolution is powered by the improved RD-58MF , a less powerful but more efficient evolution of the venerable engine . It can carry 25% more propellant than the Blok DM-2 , which it replaced as a Proton upper stage for some government launches .

The Zenit-3SL design began in the late 1980s as the Zenit-3 , a proposed replacement for the Proton-K , which would have used a Zenit-2 rocket with a Block D upper stage . This proposal was shelved after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , as Russia inherited the space programme , however the Zenit was manufactured in Ukraine . Boeing became involved in the programme in 1994 . The design was subsequently modified , with a modified version of the Block DM replacing the Block D. Sea Launch integrates the rockets in California , and transfers them to Odyssey via the Sea Launch Commander for transportation to the launch site . Once at the launch site , the rocket is erected on the platform , and a three-day countdown is initiated . The countdown is fully automated , and personnel are evacuated from the launch platform to Commander prior to launch . Zenit-3SL launches predominantly carry communications satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbits .",

It was a member of the Atlas family of rockets , and was used to launch seven communication satellites during the mid to late 1980s . Atlas G consisted of an improved Atlas core with modernized avionics and stretched propellant tanks . The Centaur stage also had several updated components and other technical improvements . It was replaced by the Atlas I , which had an improved guidance system . The maiden voyage of Atlas G was the launch of Intelsat 5 on June 9 , 1984 . Atlas performance was normal as was Centaur orbital injection , but during the coasting phase prior to the second Centaur burn , the stage 's LOX tank split open . The Centaur and Intelsat tumbled end-over-end and were left in a useless orbit where they remained until reentering the atmosphere four months later . Investigation into the failure found that a minor fatigue crack developed in the Centaur LOX tank during staging and orbital injection , which eventually led to complete tank failure and loss of the mission . The uprated Centaur flown on Atlas G , among other changes , deleted the propellant boost pumps in the interest of greater simplicity and weight-saving . To compensate for this , LOX tank pressure was increased 25% . Although the tank had been designed to accommodate higher pressure , technicians at Convair inexplicably failed to test Centaur 5402 for leaks before shipping it to Cape Canaveral .",

  "/wiki/Titan_IIIA": "The Titan IIIA or Titan 3A was an American expendable launch system , launched four times in 1964 and 1965 , to test the Transtage upper stage which was intended for use on the larger Titan IIIC . The Transtage was mounted atop two core stages derived from the Titan II . The Titan IIIA was also used as the core of the Titan IIIC . The Titan IIIA made its first flight on 1 September 1964 . However , the Transtage failed to pressurize , resulting in a premature cutoff and failure to reach orbit . A second test on 10 December was successful . Two further launches occurred in 1965 with Lincoln Experimental Satellites , before the Titan IIIA was retired .",
  "/wiki/Titan_IIIC": "The Titan IIIC was an expendable launch system used by the United States Air Force from 1965 until 1982 . It was the first Titan booster to feature large solid rocket motors and was planned to be used as a launcher for the Dyna-Soar , though the spaceplane was cancelled before it could fly . The majority of the launcher 's payloads were DoD satellites , for military communications and early warning , though one flight ( ATS-6 ) was performed by NASA . The Titan IIIC was launched exclusively from Cape Canaveral while its sibling , the Titan IIID , was launched only from Vandenberg AFB .",
  "/wiki/Yuanzheng-1": "Yuanzheng ( Chinese : \u8fdc\u5f81 ; pinyin : Yu\u01cen Zh\u0113ng ; literally : 'Expedition ' ) is a restartable upper stage developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology ( CALT ) for the Long March rocket family . The Yuanzheng stage enables the Chinese launch vehicles to deploy payloads directly to high-energy orbits such as medium Earth orbit ( MEO ) and geosyncronous orbit ( GSO ) . Since the Long March third stage can not restart , it can not circularize a GSO or GEO orbit from a geosyncronous transfer orbit ( GTO ) . With its restart capability , Yuanzheng has enabled the deployment of satellite pairs for the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System in MEO and communications satellites in GSO . This eliminates the need for the spacecraft to include a liquid apogee engine or an apogee kick motor . Yuanzheng has a thrust of 6.5 kN ( 1,500 lbf ) with a specific impulse of 315.5 seconds . It uses the storable hypergolic propellants unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine ( UDMH ) and dinitrogen tetroxide ( N2O4 ) , and can perform at least two burns within its rated life of 6.5 hours , sufficient to reach the transfer orbit apogee , and perform the circularization burn from there . Operational variants are designated YZ-1 for Long March 3B and 3C , YZ-1A for Long March 7 , YZ-1S for Long March 2C , YZ-2 for Long March 5 , and YZ-3 for Long March 2D .",
  "/wiki/China": "China ( Chinese : \u4e2d\u56fd ; pinyin : Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 ) , officially the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) , is a country in East Asia and is the world 's most populous country , with a population of around 1.428 billion in 2017 . Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers ( 3,700,000 sq mi ) , it is the third largest country by area . [ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",
