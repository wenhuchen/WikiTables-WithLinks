  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers , letters or symbols . [ note 1 ] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position ; alternatively , a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector . A common choice of coordinates is latitude , longitude and elevation . To specify a location on a plane requires a map projection .",
  "/wiki/Gitaru_Hydroelectric_Power_Station": "The Gitaru Hydroelectric Power Station , also known as the Gitaru Dam , is a rock and earth-filled embankment dam on the Tana River in Kenya . It straddles the border between Embu and Machakos Counties in the Eastern Province . The primary purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power generation , and it supports a 225 megawatt power station . Construction on the dam began in 1975 and was completed in 1978 . The third generating set , mobilising the full potential of the power station was not commissioned until 1999 . US $ 63 million in funding for the project was provided by the World Bank . The station is operated by the Kenya Electricity Generating Company and is part of the Seven Forks Scheme . The 30 m ( 98 ft ) tall dam withholds a 16,000,000 m3 ( 13,000 acre\u22c5ft ) reservoir . The relatively small reservoir relies on steady releases from the Masinga and Kamburu Dams upstream . The run-of-the-river power station is located underground near the left abutment . It contains two 72 megawatt and one 81 megawatt Francis turbine-generators . Water released from the station is returned to the Tana at the Kindaruma Reservoir via a 4.7 km ( 2.9 mi ) long tailrace tunnel .",
  "/wiki/Reservoir": "A reservoir ( from French r\u00e9servoir - a tank ) is , most commonly , an enlarged natural or artificial lake , pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water . Reservoirs can be created in a number of ways , including controlling a watercourse that drains an existing body of water , interrupting a watercourse to form an embayment within it , through excavation , or building any number of retaining walls or levees . Defined as a storage space for fluids , reservoirs may hold water or gasses , including hydrocarbons . Tank reservoirs store these in ground-level , elevated , or buried tanks . Tank reservoirs for water are also called cisterns . Most underground reservoirs are used to store liquids , principally either water or petroleum , below ground .",

It is Kenya 's first post-independence hydroelectric power plant . It was commissioned in 1968 as part of the Seven Forks Scheme . The power station is operated by Kenya Electricity Generating Company . Between 2007 and 2013 the power stationed underwent a rehabilitation and upgrade which increased its installed capacity from 40 MW to 72 MW . In June 2012 a third Kaplan turbine-generator , rated at 24 MW , was commissioned . In January and June 2013 , the original two 20 MW Kaplan turbine-generators were upgraded to 24 MW each , respectively .",
