  "/wiki/Sink_the_Bismarck!": "Sink the Bismarck ! is a 1960 black-and-white CinemaScope British war film based on the book The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck by C. S. Forester . It stars Kenneth More and Dana Wynter and was directed by Lewis Gilbert . To date , it is the only film made that deals directly with the operations , chase and sinking of the battleship Bismarck by the Royal Navy during the Second World War . Although war films were common in the 1960s , Sink the Bismarck ! was seen as something of an anomaly , with much of its time devoted to the unsung back-room planners as much as on the combatants themselves . Its historical accuracy , in particular , met with much praise despite a number of inconsistencies . Sink the Bismarck ! was the inspiration for Johnny Horton 's popular 1960 song , Sink the Bismarck . [ Note 1 ] The film had its Royal World Premiere in the presence of the Duke of Edinburgh at the Odeon Leicester Square on 11 February 1960 .",

Filmed by the Andersons ' production company Century 21 , it stars Roy Thinnes , Ian Hendry , Lynn Loring , Loni von Friedl and Patrick Wymark . Outside Europe , it was released as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun , the title by which it is now more commonly known . Set in 2069 , the film concerns a joint European-NASA mission to investigate a newly-discovered planet that lies parallel to Earth on the other side of the Sun . The mission ends in disaster when one of the astronauts ( Hendry ) is killed , after which his colleague ( Thinnes ) realises that the planet is a mirror image of Earth . The first major live-action film to be produced by the Andersons - then best known for children 's puppet television series such as Thunderbirds - Doppelg\u00e4nger was shot between July and October 1968 at Pinewood Studios and on location in England and Portugal . The relationship between Parrish and the Andersons became strained as filming progressed , while creative disagreements between Gerry Anderson and his business partner John Read , the film 's director of photography , led to Read 's dismissal from Century 21 . Although the Andersons wrote adult themes into the script in an attempt to distinguish Doppelg\u00e4nger from their children 's productions , cuts were needed to allow the film to be certified A by the British Board of Film Censors . Actors and props from the film were re-used during the production of the Andersons ' first live-action TV series , UFO . Doppelg\u00e4nger premiered in August 1969 in the United States and October 1969 in the United Kingdom . While the film has been praised for its special effects and set design , some commentators have judged the parallel Earth premise to be clich\u00e9d and uninspired . Some of the plot devices and imagery have been viewed as poor pastiches of other science-fiction films , such as 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) .",
