  "/wiki/Governor_of_New_Hampshire": "The Governor of New Hampshire is the head of the executive branch of New Hampshire 's state government . The governor is elected at the biennial state general election in November of even-numbered years . New Hampshire is one of only two states , along with bordering Vermont , to hold gubernatorial elections every two years as opposed to every four . Currently , the state 's 82nd governor is Republican Chris Sununu , who has served since January 5 , 2017 . In New Hampshire , the governor has no term limit of any kind . No governor has served more than three terms since the 18th century ( when the term was for only one year ) with the exception of John Lynch , who won an unprecedented fourth two-year term on November 2 , 2010 . John Taylor Gilman had been the last governor before Lynch to serve longer than six years , serving 14 one-year terms as governor between 1794 and 1816 . Unlike in many other states in which Executive Councils are merely advisory , the Executive Council of New Hampshire has a strong check on the governor 's power . The five-member council has a veto over many actions of the governor . Together , the Governor and Executive Council approve contracts with a value of $ 5,000 or more , approve pardons , and appoint the directors and commissioners , judges , the Attorney General and officers in the National Guard . The governor has the sole power to veto bills and to command the National Guard while it is not in federal service . To be qualified to be governor , one must be 30 years of age , a registered voter , and domiciled in New Hampshire for at least seven years .",

  "/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate": "The president pro tempore of the United States Senate ( often shortened to president pro tem ) is the second-highest-ranking official of the United States Senate . Article One , Section Three of the United States Constitution provides that the vice president of the United States is the president of the Senate ( despite not being a senator ) , and mandates that the Senate must choose a president pro tempore to act in the vice president 's absence . Unlike the vice president , the president pro tempore is an elected member of the Senate , able to speak or vote on any issue . Selected by the Senate at large , the president pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers . During the vice president 's absence , the president pro tempore is empowered to preside over Senate sessions . In practice , neither the vice president nor the president pro tempore usually presides ; instead , the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior U.S. senators of the majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure . Since 1890 , the most senior U.S. senator in the majority party has generally been chosen to be president pro tempore and holds the office continuously until the election of another . This tradition has been observed without interruption since 1949 . Since the enactment of the current Presidential Succession Act in 1947 , the president pro tempore is third in the line of succession to the presidency , after the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives and ahead of the secretary of state . The current president pro tempore of the Senate is Iowa Republican Charles Grassley . Elected on January 3 , 2019 , he is the 91st person to serve in this office .",
