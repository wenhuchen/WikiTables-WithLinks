  "/wiki/LGBT": "LGBT ( also acronymed as LGBTQ ( + ) or GLBT ) is an initialism that stands for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender . In use since the 1990s , the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB , which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s . Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred . The initialism has become adopted into the mainstream as an umbrella term for use when labeling topics pertaining to sexuality and gender identity . For example , the LGBT Movement Advancement Project termed community centres , which have services specific to those members of the LGBT community , as LGBT community centers , in a comprehensive studies of such centres around the United States . The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures . It may be used to refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender , instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender . To recognize this inclusion , a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity ; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996 . Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI . The two acronyms are sometimes combined to form the terms LGBTIQ or LGBT+ to encompass spectrums of sexuality and gender . Other , less common variants also exist , motivated by a desire for inclusivity , including those over twice as long which have prompted criticism .",

Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba .

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",

  "/wiki/Bangkok_Gay_and_Lesbian_Film_Festival": "Bangkok Gay and Lesbian Film Festival ( BGLFF ) was established by the staff of 'Attitude Magazine ' , an LGBT weekly publication from Bangkok in Thailand , in 2015 . The magazine , which began publishing in 2011 , is the first in Thailand to specifically address the interests of the country 's LGBT community , and to seek to represent LGBT views in wider Thai society . The magazine decided therefore to launch Thailand 's first-ever LGBT Festival , as LGBT people and issues have already gained acceptance in Thai society for many years , and several other countries in the East Asian region , which sometimes record less legal acceptance of LGBT issues than Thailand , such as Indonesia ( which has held Asia 's largest LGBT film festival , Q ! Film Festival , every year since 2002 ) , The Philippines ( which holds the annual Pride International Film Festival ) , Cambodia and Myanmar , already have well-established LGBT film festivals . The magazine argues that , with Thailand 's enactment of the 2015 Gender Equality Act , discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is no longer tolerated in Thai society . Despite the advances made over many years , the magazine believes that the LGBT community is not always portrayed in a positive light in Thai films and other forms of media , with certain stereotypes still prevalent whenever movies , in particular , address gender diversity . The magazine believes that the Festival will therefore help to provide a more realistic and varied view of the LGBT community . The first film to open the first Festival in 2015 was How To Win At Checkers ( Every Time ) , a film about two brothers , one gay , set around a military draft day in Thailand . The 2015 Festival lasted for 10 days , with 15 films from 12 countries , including Vietnam , Indonesia , the Philippines , China , South Korea , the United States and Europe . Sanchai Chotirosseranee , deputy director of Film Archive and partner of the BGLFF 2015 , claims that it has been a long journey for the LGBT community in Thailand . In the 1955 Thai film , Chua Fah Din Salai , the Thai male comedian , Lor Tok , was shown dressing up as a woman and dancing with another male character . From then until now , the portrayal of what were dismissively referred to as 'katoey ' meant that LGBT characters were presented as comic relief in films and soap operas , and had become the norm in Thai society .",

Over fourteen million people ( 22.2 percent ) lived within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census , making Bangkok the nation 's primate city , dwarfing Thailand 's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy . Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century , which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities : Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782 . Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam , later renamed Thailand , during the late-19th century , as the country faced pressures from the West . The city was at the centre of Thailand 's political struggles throughout the 20th century , as the country abolished absolute monarchy , adopted constitutional rule , and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings . The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand 's politics , economy , education , media and modern society .

Various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon kingdoms , Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region , competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na and Ayutthaya , which rivaled each other . Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya , now one of the great powers in the region . Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign ( 1656-1688 ) , gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 Burmese-Siamese War .
