Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard , Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , \u00c9ric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette , Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma before beginning his career as a film maker . Chabrol 's career began with Le Beau Serge ( 1958 ) , inspired by Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) . Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol , with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity . This is especially apparent in Les Biches ( 1968 ) , La Femme infid\u00e8le ( 1969 ) , and Le Boucher ( 1970 ) - all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran , who was his wife at the time . Sometimes characterized as a mainstream New Wave director , Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career . In 1978 , he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozi\u00e8re . On the strength of that effort , the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary ( 1991 ) and La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie ( 1996 ) . Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper , if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol 's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium.Some of his films become almost private jokes , made to amuse himself . James Monaco has called Chabrol the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave , and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we do n't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard .",

Born in Mogliano , in the province of Macerata , Girotti developed his athletic physique by swimming and playing polo . While studying engineering , he attracted the attention of Mario Soldati , who offered him a small part in the film Dora Nelson ( 1939 ) , but it was not until later , in Alessandro Blasetti 's La corona di ferro ( The Iron Crown ) ( 1941 ) and Roberto Rossellini 's Un Pilota ritorna ( A Pilot Returns ) ( 1942 ) , that he began to make an impression as a serious actor . In 1943 came a turning point in his career when Luchino Visconti cast him opposite the torrid Clara Calamai in Ossessione ( Obsession ) , an earlier adaptation of the same novel on which Hollywood 's The Postman Always Rings Twice is based . The film marked , in a sense , the birth of Italian neo-realism . Some of his notable post-war films include Caccia tragica ( The Tragic Hunt ) ( 1946 ) by Giuseppe De Santis and In nome della legge ( 1949 ) ( In the Name of the Law ) by Pietro Germi . In 1950 , he starred opposite Lucia Bos\u00e9 in Michelangelo Antonioni 's first full-length feature , Cronaca di un amore ( Story of a Love Affair ) ( 1950 ) . In 1953 , he played Spartacus in an Italian epic film known in the US as Sins of Rome and then , returned to work again for Visconti , in Senso ( 1954 ) , giving perhaps the finest performance of his career . In the years which followed , he appeared in many mainly Italian films for directors such as Lizzani , Bolognini , Vittorio Cottafavi , Lattuada , but it was not until 1968 that he once again played a role worthy of his talents - that of the father in Pasolini 's Teorema ( Theorem ) with Terence Stamp and Silvana Mangano .
