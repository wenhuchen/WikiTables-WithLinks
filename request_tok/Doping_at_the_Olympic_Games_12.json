  "/wiki/Hydrochlorothiazide": "Hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ or HCT ) is a diuretic medication often used to treat high blood pressure and swelling due to fluid build up . Other uses include diabetes insipidus , renal tubular acidosis , and to decrease the risk of kidney stones in those with a high calcium level in the urine . For high blood pressure it is sometimes considered as a first-line treatment . HCTZ is taken by mouth and may be combined with other blood pressure medications as a single pill to increase effectiveness . Potential side effects include poor kidney function , electrolyte imbalances including low blood potassium and less commonly low blood sodium , gout , high blood sugar , and feeling lightheaded with standing . While allergies to HCTZ are reported to occur more often in those with allergies to sulfa drugs , this association is not well supported . It may be used during pregnancy , but it is not a first-line medication in this group . It is in the thiazide medication class and acts by decreasing the kidneys ' ability to retain water . This initially reduces blood volume , decreasing blood return to the heart and thus cardiac output . It is believed to lower peripheral vascular resistance in the long run . Two companies , Merck and Ciba , state they discovered the medication which became commercially available in 1959 . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system .",

  "/wiki/Continuous_erythropoietin_receptor_activator": "Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator ( CERA ) is the generic term for drugs in a new class of third-generation erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) . In the media , these agents are commonly referred to as 'EPO ' , short for erythropoietin . CERAs have an extended half-life and a mechanism of action that promotes increased stimulation of erythropoietin receptors compared with other ESAs . Under the trade name Mircera , Roche Pharmaceuticals received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in January 2008 to market a continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator ( methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta ) for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease , including in those undergoing dialysis . . [ citation needed ] This issue appears to have been resolved since Fresenius Medical dialysis clinics in the US are now administering this drug . [ citation needed ] ) Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta had been approved by the European Commission in August 2007 , and was made available in Europe at the start of 2008 . In terms of its structure , Mircera is similar to the previous synthetic EPO drugs , except that it is connected to a chemical called polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , which makes it last longer in the body . According to Roche , the product has the longest half-life of all FDA-approved erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) : up to 6 times longer than darbepoetin alfa and up to 20 times longer than epoetin . CERAs thus promise both lower dosing - significant owing to the high inherent cost of manufacturing recombinant protein drugs - and less frequent injections for patients . ESAs are administered via subcutaneous injections , often in doctor 's offices for patients who lack the skill or dexterity to inject themselves , so the once- or twice-monthly dosing regimen for CERAs promises fewer costly , inconvenient office visits for patients requiring constant hemoglobin level maintenance for chronic kidney disease . In clinical trials , CERA dosed every 3 to 4 weeks demonstrated efficacy similar to that of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa in maintaining hemoglobin concentrations within the target hemoglobin range .",

It acts as a ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHSR ) agonist , and was the first of this class of drugs to be introduced clinically . Acute administration of the drug markedly increases the levels of plasma growth hormone ( GH ) and reliably induces sensations of hunger and increases food intake in humans . Pralmorelin was also under investigation for the treatment of GHD and short stature ( pituitary dwarfism ) , and made it to phase II clinical trials for these indications , but was ultimately never marketed for them .
