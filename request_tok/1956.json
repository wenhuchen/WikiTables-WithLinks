He was also given the task to arrange the British birds collections , in the course of which he developed a lasting interest in ornithology . The 200 papers he published in his 18 years at the museum soon brought him recognition as an authority on Arachnida and Myriapoda ; he described between 300 and 400 species of millipedes alone , and also described the scorpion genus Brachistosternus .

His major work was however on the mammals of India and after his retirement in 1904 , became a regular worker at the Natural History Museum in London . He initially took an interest in African mammals and there was little material from India . He persuaded his friends in India to collect specimens and this led to a collaborative mammal survey in 1911 . Interest in small mammals was also raised by work on plague particularly due to the work of Captain Glen Liston who delivered a special address to the members of the BNHS . Collectors for the small mammal survey included C. A. Crump ( Khandesh , Darjeeling ) , Sir Ernest Hotson ( Baluchistan ) , R. Shunkara Narayan Pillay ( Travancore ) , J. M. D.
