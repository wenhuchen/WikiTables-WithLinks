It was the 7th most populous council area in Scotland at the 2011 census . It shares borders with the council areas of Aberdeenshire , Argyll and Bute , Moray and Perth and Kinross . Their councils , and those of Angus and Stirling , also have areas of the Scottish Highlands within their administrative boundaries .

Standing at 1,345 metres ( 4,411 ft ) above sea level , it is at the western end of the Grampian Mountains in the Lochaber area of the Scottish Highlands , close to the town of Fort William . The mountain is a popular destination , attracting an estimated 100,000 ascents a year , around three-quarters of which use the Pony Track from Glen Nevis . The 700-metre ( 2,300 ft ) cliffs of the north face are among the highest in Scotland , providing classic scrambles and rock climbs of all difficulties for climbers and mountaineers . They are also the principal locations in Scotland for ice climbing . The summit , which is the collapsed dome of an ancient volcano , features the ruins of an observatory which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904 . The meteorological data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather . C. T. R. Wilson was inspired to invent the cloud chamber after a period spent working at the observatory .",
  "/wiki/Aberdeenshire": "Aberdeenshire ( Scots : Aiberdeenshire ; Scottish Gaelic : Siorrachd Obar Dheathain ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland . It takes its name from the County of Aberdeen which has substantially different boundaries . The Aberdeenshire council area includes all of the area of the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire ( except the area making up the City of Aberdeen ) , as well as part of Banffshire . The county boundaries are officially used for a few purposes , namely land registration and lieutenancy . Aberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House , in Aberdeen , making it the only Scottish council whose headquarters are located outside its jurisdiction . Aberdeen itself forms a different council area ( Aberdeen City ) . Aberdeenshire borders onto Angus and Perth and Kinross to the south , Highland and Moray to the west and Aberdeen City to the east . Traditionally , it has been economically dependent upon the primary sector ( agriculture , fishing , and forestry ) and related processing industries . Over the last 40 years , the development of the oil and gas industry and associated service sector has broadened Aberdeenshire 's economic base , and contributed to a rapid population growth of some 50% since 1975 . Its land represents 8% of Scotland 's overall territory . It covers an area of 6,313 square kilometres ( 2,437 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Ben_Macdhui_(Scotland)": "Ben Macdui ( Scottish Gaelic : Beinn Mac Duibh ) is the second highest mountain in the United Kingdom ( in absolute height ) after Ben Nevis , and the highest in the Cairngorms National Park . After the defeat of Domnall mac Uilliam in 1187 , Donnchad II , Earl of Fife , acquired Strathavon , a territory stretching from Ballindalloch to Ben Macdui ; because the mountain marked the western boundary of Donnchad 's territory , historian and place-name scholar Professor G.W.S . Barrow has suggested that the mountain took its name from Donnchad 's family , the Mac Duibh . Ben Macdui lies on the southern edge of the Cairn Gorm plateau , on the boundary between Aberdeenshire and Moray . Probably the easiest route of ascent is from the Coire Cas car park at the foot of Cairngorm Ski Centre by a path that leads up over slowly rising moorland . This route is about 7 km ( 4 mi ) long ; a somewhat longer route allows one also to climb Cairn Gorm . One possible alternative route follows the path coming up from Loch Etchachan . This loch may be reached from Loch Avon to the north or by coming up from Glen Derry to the south . Other routes include coming over Derry Cairngorm , or via the Lairig Ghru pass , which lies to the west of Ben Macdui . Nearly all these routes are long days by Scottish standards . [ clarification needed ] When coming from the south it is common to use a bicycle to cover the 5 km ( 3\u00bd mi ) from the road end at Linn of Dee to Derry Lodge at the southern end of the massif . Before the production of accurate maps of Scotland in the 19th century it was not known for certain that Ben Nevis was the highest point in Britain , and it was often thought that Ben Macdui might be the higher .",

  "/wiki/Ben_Lawers": "Ben Lawers ( Scottish Gaelic : Beinn Labhair ) is the highest mountain in the southern part of the Scottish Highlands . It lies to the north of Loch Tay , and is the highest point of a long ridge that includes seven Munros . It is the highest peak in Perthshire , and is the tenth highest Munro in Scotland . Ben Lawers was long thought to be over 4,000 feet ( 1,219.2 m ) in height ; accurate measurement in the 1870s showed it to be some 17 feet ( 5.2 m ) short of this figure . Ben Lawers lies on the watershed between the rivers Tay and Lyon . Since the 1950s , water has been captured from the numerous burns on the south face of Ben Lawers and Meall nan Tarmachan as part of the Breadalbane Hydro-Electric Scheme . The water is diverted to the Lochan na Lairige , from where it is piped to drive hydro-electric turbines at Finlarig on the banks of Loch Tay . The level of the Lochan na Lairige was raised by the construction of the 344 metre-long Lawers Dam , a buttress-type dam that is 42 m high . Due to the height of this reservoir the static head of water is 415 m , the highest available on any hydro-electric scheme in Scotland . Due to its high altitude and underlying geology Ben Lawers is home to an exceptionally rich selection of arctic-alpine plant species and habitats , and has been designated as a National Nature Reserve ( NNR ) since 1964 .",

The simplest ascent starts from Benmore Farm on the A85 . Initially one should follow the path leading up Benmore Burn , before leaving this path and heading up the northwest ridge of Ben More . The ridge is unrelentingly steep , rising 1,000 metres ( 3,281 ft ) in about 2.5 miles ( 4.0 km ) . The north-east ridge may prove a preferable alternative , being craggier and less steep . To reach this the walker should follow the burn of Allt Coire Chaorach , before striking for the ridge of Sr\u00f2n nam F\u00f2irsairean once clear of the forestry that cloaks the lower slopes of this side of Ben More . This route is around 5 kilometres ( 3.1 mi ) long . Ben More is often climbed in conjunction with Stob Binnein by descending to the Bealach-eadar-dha Beinn and then on to the second peak .

  "/wiki/West_Lothian": "West Lothian ( Scots : Wast Lowden ; Scottish Gaelic : Lodainn an Iar ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland , and one of its historic counties . The county , which was also known as Linlithgowshire , was bounded geographically by the Avon to the west and the Almond to the east . The modern council area occupies a larger area , with areas in the west transferred to Falkirk and areas in the east transferred to Edinburgh following local government reforms in the late 20th century . It did however gain areas from Midlothian . West Lothian lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth and is predominantly rural , though there were extensive coal , iron , and shale oil mining operations in the 19th and 20th centuries , which created distinctive red spoil heaps ( locally known as bings ) throughout the council area . The old county town was the royal burgh of Linlithgow , but the largest town ( and the second largest town in Lothian after Edinburgh ) is now Livingston .",
