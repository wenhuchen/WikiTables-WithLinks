  "/wiki/Safety_(American_football_position)": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",

  "/wiki/National_Football_League": "The National Football League ( NFL ) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the National Football Conference ( NFC ) and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) . The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 . The Green Bay Packers hold the most combined NFL championships with 13 , winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards . Since the creation of the Super Bowl , the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots both have the most championship titles at six .",
  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

The Saints began play in Tulane Stadium in 1967 where they remained until the 1974 NFL season , when they moved to the new Louisiana Superdome ( now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome ) . The name Saints is an allusion to November 1 being All Saints ' Day in the Catholic faith . New Orleans has a large Catholic population , and the spiritual When the Saints Go Marching In is strongly associated with New Orleans and is often sung by fans at games . The team 's primary colors are old gold and black ; their logo is a simplified fleur-de-lis . For most of their first 20 years , the Saints were barely competitive , only getting to .500 twice . In 1987 , they finished 12-3 - their first-ever winning season - and qualified for the NFL playoffs for the first time in franchise history , but lost to the Minnesota Vikings 44-10 . The next season in 1988 ended with a 10-6 record , but no playoff berth . Following the 2000 regular season , the Saints defeated the defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams 31-28 to notch their first-ever playoff win .

  "/wiki/Pro_Bowl": "The Pro Bowl is the all-star game of the National Football League ( NFL ) . From the merger with the rival American Football League ( AFL ) in 1970 up through 2013 and since 2017 , it is officially called the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl , matching the top players in the American Football Conference ( AFC ) against those in the National Football Conference ( NFC ) . From 2014 through 2016 , the NFL experimented with an unconferenced format , where the teams were selected by two honorary team captains ( who are each in the Hall of Fame ) , instead of selecting players from each conference . The players were picked in a televised schoolyard pick prior to the game . Unlike most major sports leagues , which hold their all-star games roughly midway through their regular seasons , the Pro Bowl is played around the end of the NFL season . The first official Pro Bowl was played in January 1951 , three weeks after the 1950 NFL Championship Game ( between 1939 and 1942 , the NFL experimented with all-star games pitting the league 's champion against a team of all-stars ) . Between 1970 and 2009 , the Pro Bowl was usually held the weekend after the Super Bowl . Since 2010 , it has been played the weekend before the Super Bowl . Players from the two teams competing in the Super Bowl do not participate . For years , the game has suffered from lack of interest due to perceived low quality , with observers and commentators expressing their disfavor with it in its current state . It draws lower TV ratings than regular season NFL games , although the game draws similar ratings to other major all-star games , such as the Major League Baseball All-Star Game . However , the biggest concern of teams is to avoid injuries to the star players .",

  "/wiki/American_Football_League": "The American Football League ( AFL ) was a major professional American football league that operated for ten seasons from 1960 until 1969 , when it merged with the older National Football League ( NFL ) , and became the American Football Conference . The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence . It was more successful than earlier rivals to the NFL with the same name , the 1926 , 1936 and 1940 leagues , and the later All-America Football Conference ( which existed between 1944 and 1950 but only played between 1946 and 1949 ) . This fourth version of the AFL was the most successful , created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises . The AFL 's original lineup consisted of an Eastern division of the New York Titans , Boston Patriots , Buffalo Bills , and the Houston Oilers , and a Western division of the Los Angeles Chargers , Denver Broncos , Oakland Raiders , and Dallas Texans . The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the NFL 's first-round draft choices in 1960 , including Houston 's successful signing of college star and Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon . While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance , the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) ( followed by a contract with the competing National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) for games starting with the 1965 season ) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide . Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s , as well as successful franchise shifts of the Chargers from L.A. south to San Diego and the Texans north to Kansas City ( becoming the Kansas City Chiefs ) , the AFL established a dedicated following . The transformation of the struggling Titans into the New York Jets under new ownership further solidified the league 's reputation among the major media . As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues , especially after a series of raids , the leagues agreed to a merger in 1966 . Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions first played in early 1967 , which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl . The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970 , with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game .",

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time ."
