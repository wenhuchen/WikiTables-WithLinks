  "/wiki/Thomas_Wassberg": "Thomas Lars Wassberg ( born 27 March 1956 ) is a Swedish former cross-country skier . A fast skating style - push for every leg - is still called Wassberg after him in several countries . Wassberg 's skiing idols when growing up were Sixten Jernberg and Oddvar Br\u00e5 . He has described his mental strength and physical fitness as his greatest abilities as a skier , with his main weakness being a lack of sprinting ability . Wassberg won four Olympic gold medals : in 15 km ( 1980 ) , 50 km ( 1984 ) , and the 4 \u00d7 10 km relay ( 1984 , 1988 ) , and served as the Olympic flag bearer for Sweden in 1988 . At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships , he earned three golds ( 50 km : 1982 , 30 km : 1987 , and 4 \u00d7 10 km relay : 1987 ) , three silvers ( 15 km : 1985 , 1987 ; 50 km ( 1987 ) , and one bronze ( 4 \u00d7 10 km relay : 1985 ) . Additionally , Wassberg won the 50 km at the Holmenkollen ski festival three times ( 1980 , 1982 and 1987 ) and the 15 km twice ( 1979 , 1985 ) . At the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid , Wassberg edged out Finland 's Juha Mieto by 0.01 seconds in the 15 km , the closest cross-country ski race in Olympic history . Wassberg subsequently suggested to Mieto that the gold medal should be split between them as one one-hundredth of a second is nothing in a 15-kilometer race . This incident led the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) to change their timing to the nearest one-tenth of a second . It also resulted in an apocryphal urban legend that Wassberg and Mieto 's medals were cut in half and re-welded into half-gold , half-silver medals . At the 1984 Winter Olympics , Wassberg beat out fellow Swede Gunde Svan by 4.9 seconds in the 50 km , the closest margin of victory ever in that event until Giorgio Di Centa edged out Yevgeny Dementyev by 0.8 seconds at the 2006 Winter Olympics though the 2006 event was a mass start event while the 1984 event was an interval start event .",
