  "/wiki/St_Benet's_Hall,_Oxford": "St Benet 's Hall ( known colloquially as Benet 's ) is a Permanent Private Hall ( PPH ) of the University of Oxford . Established in 1897 by Ampleforth Abbey , it is a Benedictine foundation whose principal historic function was to allow its monks to be able to study for secular degrees at the university . Today , most members of the hall are not monks , but lay undergraduates and graduates . The hall , which is still owned by Ampleforth Abbey , has a Benedictine and Roman Catholic ethos . However , there is no requirement that members of the hall should be Catholics . St Benet 's was the last constituent body of the University of Oxford admitting men alone to read for undergraduate and graduate degrees . It was also the last single-sex college or hall in the university after St Hilda 's College , the last all-women 's college in Oxford , admitted men in 2008 . In November 2013 , the hall formally announced its intention to admit women graduate students within one year and women undergraduates as soon as additional housing facilities were obtained . Women were admitted as graduate students in October 2014 and as undergraduates in October 2016 . Thus , 2016 is the year that all constituent colleges and halls of the university became fully co-educational . The University of Cambridge still has three constituent colleges for women only . The 2007 review of the PPHs conducted by the university concluded that St Benet 's had a good sense of its place within the collegiate University and drew attention to the commitment and care of the hall 's academic staff .",

At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations .

In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east .

At 513,120 km2 ( 198,120 sq mi ) and over 68 million people , Thailand is the world 's 50th-largest country by total area and the 21st-most-populous country . The capital and largest city is Bangkok , a special administrative area .

Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast , and Indonesia and India on the Andaman Sea to the southwest . It is a unitary state . Although nominally the country is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , the most recent coup , in 2014 , established a de facto military dictatorship under a junta . Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century ; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the exonym Siamese dates to the 12th century . Various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon kingdoms , Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region , competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na and Ayutthaya , which rivaled each other . Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya , now one of the great powers in the region . Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign ( 1656-1688 ) , gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 Burmese-Siamese War . Taksin ( r. 1767-1782 ) quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom .",
