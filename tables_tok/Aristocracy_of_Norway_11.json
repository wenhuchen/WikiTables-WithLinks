  "intro": "Aristocracy of Norway refers to modern and medieval aristocracy in Norway. Additionally, there have been economical, political, and military \u00e9lites that - relating to the main lines of Norway's history - are generally accepted as nominal predecessors of the aforementioned. Since the 16th century, modern aristocracy is known as nobility (Norwegian: adel). The very first aristocracy in today's Norway appeared during the Bronze Age (1800 BC-500 BC). This bronze aristocracy consisted of several regional \u00e9lites, whose earliest known existence dates to 1500 BC. Via similar structures in the Iron Age (400 BC-793 AD), these entities would reappear as petty kingdoms before and during the Age of Vikings (793-1066). Beside a chieftain or petty king, each kingdom had its own aristocracy. Between 872 and 1050, during the so-called unification process, the first national aristocracy began to develop. Regional monarchs and aristocrats who recognised King Harald I as their high king, would normally receive vassalage titles like Earl. Those who refused were defeated or chose to migrate to Iceland, establishing an aristocratic, clan-ruled state there. The subsequent lendman aristocracy in Norway - powerful feudal lords and their families - ruled their respective regions with great autonomy. Their status was by no means equal to that of modern nobles; they were nearly half royal."
