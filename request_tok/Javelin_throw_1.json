Following the assassination of the First Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party ( Bolsheviks ) Sergei Kirov ( in office 1926-1934 ) , the town was renamed Kirovo ( Ukrainian : \u041a\u0406\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e [ k\u02b2\u00edr\u0254v\u0254 ] ) in Kirov 's honour on 7 December 1934 , as did numerous other localities throughout the USSR ( including present-day Kirov in Kirov Oblast , Kirovakan , Kirovabad , as well as a uncountable number of Kirovsk , Kirovo , Kirovsky and other derivatives ) . Concurrently to the creation of the Kirovohrad Oblast on 10 January 1939 , and to distinguish it from the Kirov Oblast in central Russia , Kirovo was renamed Kirovohrad ( Ukrainian : \u041a\u0456\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0434 [ kirowo\u02c8\u0266r\u0251d ] ; Russian : \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0434 , romanized : Kirovograd ) , a name it maintained until 2016 . Due to decommunization the name of the city was changed to Kropyvnytskyi , after writer , actor and playwright Marko Kropyvnytskyi , who was born near the city . However the Kirovohrad Oblast was not renamed because as it is mentioned in the Constitution of Ukraine , and the Oblast can only be renamed by a constitutional amendment . The city is the birthplace of noted figures such as Grigory Zinoviev , Volodymyr Vynnychenko , Arseny Tarkovsky , African Spir , Marko Kropyvnytskyi and others ."
