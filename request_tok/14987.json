Initially a local revolt against renegade janissaries who had seized power through a coup , it evolved into a war for independence ( the Serbian Revolution ) after more than three centuries of Ottoman rule and short-lasting Austrian occupations . The janissary commanders murdered the Ottoman Vizier in 1801 and occupied the sanjak , ruling it independently from the Ottoman Sultan . Tyranny ensued ; the janissaries suspended the rights granted to Serbs by the Sultan earlier , increased taxes , and imposed forced labor , among other things . In 1804 the janissaries feared that the Sultan would use the Serbs against them , so they murdered many Serbian chiefs . Enraged , an assembly chose Kara\u0111or\u0111e as leader of the uprising , and the rebel army quickly defeated and took over towns throughout the sanjak , technically fighting for the Sultan . The Sultan , fearing their power , ordered all pashaliks in the region to crush them . The Serbs marched against the Ottomans and , after major victories in 1805-06 , established a government and parliament that returned the land to the people , abolished forced labor , and reduced taxes . Military success continued over the years ; however , there was dissent between Kara\u0111or\u0111e and other leaders - Kara\u0111or\u0111e wanted absolute power while his dukes , some of whom abused their privileges for personal gain , wanted to limit it .
