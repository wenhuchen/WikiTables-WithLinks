  "/wiki/Metre": "The metre ( Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling ) or meter ( American spelling ) ( from the French unit m\u00e8tre , from the Greek noun \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd , measure ) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units ( SI ) . The SI unit symbol is m. The metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second . The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle , so the Earth 's circumference is approximately 40,000 km . In 1799 , the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar ( the actual bar used was changed in 1889 ) . In 1960 , the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 . In 1983 , the current definition was adopted .",

The proportion of C-types may actually be greater than this , because C-types are much darker ( and therefore less detectable ) than most other asteroid types except for D-types and others that are mostly at the extreme outer edge of the asteroid belt .",
