Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years , and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region , making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites . During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 . A gold rush occurred in the colony in 1851 , and over the next century , Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre . After World War II , it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world .",

In 1949 the four Home Unions formally created a Tours Committee and for the first time , every player of the 1950 Lions squad had played internationally before the tour . The 1950s tours saw high win rates in provincial games , but the Test series were typically lost or drawn . The winning series in 1971 ( New Zealand ) and 1974 ( South Africa ) changed this pattern .

A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe , 28 kilometres ( 17 mi ) north of the central business district , but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825 , opening to free settlement in 1842 . Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859 . During World War II , Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for United States Army General Douglas MacArthur . A diverse city with 32.2% of its metropolitan population being foreign born , Brisbane is ranked as a world city , and ranks highly in ratings of livable cities .",
