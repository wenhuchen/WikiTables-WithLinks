  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_I": "The first AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional American football , known retroactively as Super Bowl I and referred to in some contemporaneous reports , including the game 's radio broadcast , as the Super Bowl , was played on January 15 , 1967 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles , California . The National Football League ( NFL ) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League ( AFL ) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35-10 . Coming into this game , considerable animosity existed between the AFL and NFL , thus the teams representing the two rival leagues ( Kansas City and Green Bay , respectively ) felt pressure to win . The Chiefs posted an 11-2-1 record during the 1966 AFL season , and defeated the Buffalo Bills 31-7 , in the AFL Championship Game . The Packers finished the 1966 NFL season at 12-2 , and defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34-27 in the NFL Championship Game . Still , many sports writers and fans believed any team in the older NFL was vastly superior to any club in the upstart AFL , and so expected Green Bay would blow out Kansas City . The first half of Super Bowl I was competitive , as the Chiefs outgained the Packers in total yards , 181-164 , to come within 14-10 at halftime . Early in the 3rd quarter , Green Bay safety Willie Wood intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards to the 5-yard line . The turnover sparked the Packers to score 21 unanswered points in the second half . Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr , who completed 16 of 23 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns , with one interception , was named MVP . It remains the only Super Bowl to have been simulcast in the United States by two networks . NBC had the rights to nationally televise AFL games , while CBS held the rights to broadcast NFL games ; both were allowed to televise the game .",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_II": "The second AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional football , known retroactively as Super Bowl II , was played on January 14 , 1968 , at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida . The National Football League ( NFL ) 's defending champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League ( AFL ) champion Oakland Raiders by the score of 33-14 . This game and Super Bowl III are the only two Super Bowl games to be played in back-to-back years in the same stadium . Coming into this game , like during the first Super Bowl , many sports writers and fans believed that any team in the NFL was vastly superior to any club in the AFL . The Packers , the defending champions , posted a 9-4-1 record during the 1967 NFL season before defeating the Dallas Cowboys , 21-17 , in the 1967 NFL Championship Game ( also popularly known as the Ice Bowl ) . The Raiders finished the 1967 AFL season at 13-1 , and defeated the Houston Oilers , 40-7 , in the 1967 AFL Championship Game . As expected , Green Bay dominated Oakland throughout most of Super Bowl II . The Raiders could only score two touchdown passes from quarterback Daryle Lamonica . Meanwhile , Packers kicker Don Chandler made four field goals , including three in the first half , while defensive back Herb Adderley had a 60-yard interception return for a touchdown . Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr was named the MVP for the second straight time , becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl MVP for his 13 of 24 passes for 202 yards and one touchdown .",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_VII": "Super Bowl VII was an American football game between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion Miami Dolphins and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Washington Redskins to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 1972 season . The Dolphins defeated the Redskins by the score of 14-7 , and became the first and still the only team in NFL history to complete a perfect undefeated season . They also remain the only Super Bowl champion to win despite having been shut out in the second half of the game . The game was played on January 14 , 1973 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles , the second time the Super Bowl was played in that city . At kickoff , the temperature was 84 \u00b0F ( 29 \u00b0C ) , making the game the warmest Super Bowl . This was the Dolphins ' second Super Bowl appearance ; they had lost Super Bowl VI to Dallas the previous year . The Dolphins posted an undefeated 14-0 regular season record before defeating the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs . The Redskins were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11-3 regular-season record and playoff victories over the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys . Despite being undefeated , the Dolphins were actually one-point underdogs , largely based on the weakness of their regular-season schedule . Super Bowl VII was largely dominated by the Dolphins , and is the second-lowest-scoring Super Bowl to date with a total of only 21 points ( three touchdowns and three extra points ) , second only to the 13-3 score of Super Bowl LIII . The only real drama occurred during the final minutes of the game , in what was later known as Garo 's Gaffe . Miami attempted to cap their 17-0 perfect season with a 17-0 shutout by means of a 42-yard field goal by Garo Yepremian , but instead the game and the season was jeopardized when his kick was blocked .",

This was also the first Super Bowl not to be held in either the Los Angeles , Miami or New Orleans areas . It was also the last Super Bowl , and penultimate game overall ( the 1974 Pro Bowl in Kansas City played the next week was the last ) to feature goal posts at the front of the end zone ( they were moved to the endline , in the back of the endzone , the next season ) . This was the Dolphins ' third consecutive Super Bowl appearance . They posted a 12-2 record during the regular season , then defeated the Cincinnati Bengals and the Oakland Raiders in the playoffs . The Vikings were making their second Super Bowl appearance after also finishing the regular season with a 12-2 record , and posting postseason victories over the Washington Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys . Super Bowl VIII was largely dominated by the Dolphins , who scored 24 unanswered points during the first three quarters , including two touchdowns on their first two drives . Minnesota 's best chance to threaten Miami occurred with less than a minute left in the first half , but Vikings running back Oscar Reed fumbled the ball away at the Dolphins ' 6-yard line , and his team was unable to overcome Miami 's lead in the second half . The Dolphins ' Larry Csonka became the first running back to be named Super Bowl MVP ; both his 145 rushing yards and his 33 carries were Super Bowl records .",

The game was played on January 12 , 1975 , at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans , Louisiana . The Steelers defeated the Vikings by the score of 16-6 to win their first Super Bowl championship .

Led by quarterback Terry Bradshaw and the Steel Curtain defense , the Steelers advanced to their first Super Bowl after posting a 10-3-1 regular season record and playoff victories over the Buffalo Bills and the Oakland Raiders . The Vikings were led by quarterback Fran Tarkenton and the Purple People Eaters defense ; they advanced to their second consecutive Super Bowl and third overall after finishing the regular season with a 10-4 record and defeating the St. Louis Cardinals and the Los Angeles Rams in the playoffs . The first half of Super Bowl IX was a defensive struggle , with the lone score being the first safety in Super Bowl history when Tarkenton was downed in his own end zone . The Steelers then recovered a fumble on the second half kickoff , and scored on fullback Franco Harris 's 9-yard run . The Vikings cut the score , 9-6 , early in the fourth quarter by recovering a blocked punt in Pittsburgh 's end zone for a touchdown , but the Steelers then drove 66 yards on their ensuing possession to score on Larry Brown 's 4-yard touchdown reception to put the game out of reach . In total , the Steelers limited the Vikings to Super Bowl record lows of nine first downs , 119 total offensive yards , 17 rushing yards , and no offensive scores ( Minnesota 's only score came on a blocked punt , and they did not even score on the extra point attempt ) . The Steelers accomplished this despite losing starting linebackers Andy Russell and Jack Lambert , who were injured and replaced by Ed Bradley and Loren Toews for most of the second half . On the other hand , Pittsburgh had 333 yards of total offense .",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_X": "Super Bowl X was an American football game between the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Dallas Cowboys and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion Pittsburgh Steelers to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 1975 season .

The game was played at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida , on January 18 , 1976 , one of the first major national events of the United States Bicentennial year . Both the pre-game and halftime show celebrated the Bicentennial , while players on both teams wore special patches on their jerseys with the Bicentennial logo . Super Bowl X featured a contrast of playing styles between the Steelers and the Cowboys , which were , at the time , the two most popular teams in the league . The Steelers , dominating teams with their Steel Curtain defense and running game , finished the regular season with a league best 12-2 record and defeated the Baltimore Colts and the Oakland Raiders in the playoffs . The Cowboys , with their offense and flex defense , became the first NFC wild-card team to advance to the Super Bowl after posting a 10-4 regular season record and postseason victories over the Minnesota Vikings and the Los Angeles Rams . Trailing 10-7 in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl X , the Steelers rallied to score 14 unanswered points , including a 64-yard touchdown reception by Pittsburgh wide receiver Lynn Swann .

His 75-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter also tied Johnny Unitas in Super Bowl V for the longest pass in a Super Bowl . The Cowboys were able to stay close , only trailing 21-17 at the end of the third quarter , but Pittsburgh scored two touchdowns in a span of 19 seconds in the fourth period . Dallas also could not overcome turnovers , drops , and a controversial penalty during the second half .

The 49ers finished the 1989 regular season with a league best 14-2 record . The Broncos , who posted an 11-5 regular season record , entered the Super Bowl looking to avoid tying the Minnesota Vikings with four Super Bowl losses as well as the Vikings record of losing three Super Bowls in four years .

But just 45 seconds into the third quarter , Thomas was stripped of the ball , and Dallas safety James Washington returned the fumble 46 yards for a touchdown to tie the game .
