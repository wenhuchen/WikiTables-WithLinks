  "/wiki/Starship_Troopers": "Starship Troopers is a military science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein . Written in a few weeks in reaction to the U.S. suspending nuclear tests , the story was first published as a two-part serial in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction as Starship Soldier , and published as a book by G. P. Putnam 's Sons in December 1959 . The story is set in a future society ruled by a human interstellar government dominated by a military elite , referred to as the Terran Federation . The first-person narrative follows Juan Johnny Rico through his military service in the Mobile Infantry . Rico progresses from recruit to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between humans and an alien species known as Arachnids or Bugs . Interspersed with the primary plot are classroom scenes in which Rico and others discuss philosophical and moral issues , including aspects of suffrage , civic virtue , juvenile delinquency , and war ; these discussions have been described as expounding Heinlein 's own political views . Starship Troopers has been identified with a tradition of militarism in U.S. science fiction , and draws parallels between the conflict between humans and the Bugs , and the Cold War . A coming-of-age novel , Starship Troopers also critiques U.S. society of the 1950s , argues that a lack of discipline had led to a moral decline , and advocates corporal and capital punishment . Starship Troopers brought to an end Heinlein 's series of juvenile novels . It became one of his best-selling books , and is considered his most widely known work . It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960 , and garnered praise from reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military . It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support .",

The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet .
