  "/wiki/Pinkerton_National_Detective_Agency": "Pinkerton , founded as the Pinkerton National Detective Agency , is a private security guard and detective agency established in the United States by Scotsman Allan Pinkerton in 1850 and currently a subsidiary of Securitas AB . Pinkerton became famous when he claimed to have foiled a plot to assassinate president-elect Abraham Lincoln , who later hired Pinkerton agents for his personal security during the Civil War . Pinkerton 's agents performed services ranging from security guarding to private military contracting work . Notably , the Pinkerton National Detective Agency hired women and minorities from its founding , a practice uncommon at the time . Pinkerton was the largest private law enforcement organization in the world at the height of its power . During the labor strikes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , businessmen hired the Pinkerton Agency to infiltrate unions , supply guards , keep strikers and suspected unionists out of factories , and recruit goon squads to intimidate workers . One such confrontation was the Homestead Strike of 1892 , in which Pinkerton agents were called in to reinforce the strikebreaking measures of industrialist Henry Clay Frick , acting on behalf of Andrew Carnegie . The ensuing battle between Pinkerton agents and striking workers led to the deaths of seven Pinkerton agents and nine steelworkers . The Pinkertons were also used as guards in coal , iron , and lumber disputes in Illinois , Michigan , New York , Pennsylvania , and West Virginia as well as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and the Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921 . The company now operates as Pinkerton Consulting & Investigations , Inc. d.b.a . Pinkerton Corporate Risk Management , a division of the Swedish security company Securitas AB . The former Government Services division , PGS , now operates as Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services , Inc .",
  "/wiki/Compton's_Cafeteria_riot": "The Compton 's Cafeteria Riot occurred in August 1966 in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco . The incident was one of the first LGBT-related riots in United States history , preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City . [ note 1 ] It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco . The 1960s was a pivotal period for sexual , gender , and ethnic minorities , as social movements championing civil rights and sexual liberation came to fruition . Even churches , like Glide Memorial Methodist Church in San Francisco , began reaching out to the transgender community . Nevertheless , many police officers resisted these movements and the increasing visibility of these groups , continuing to harass and abuse transgender people . This simultaneous rise in support for transgender rights on the one side and the unwillingness to accept these new ideas on the other created the strain that fueled the riot at Compton 's Cafeteria in the summer of 1966 . The incident began when a transgender woman resisted arrest by throwing coffee at a police officer . It was followed by drag queens pouring into the streets , fighting back with their high heels and heavy bags .",
  "/wiki/Chicago": "Chicago ( /\u0283\u026a\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0\u0261o\u028a/ ( listen ) , locally also /\u0283\u026a\u02c8k\u0254\u02d0\u0261o\u028a/ ) , officially the City of Chicago , is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Illinois , and the third-most-populous city in the United States . With an estimated population of 2,705,994 ( 2018 ) , it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States . Chicago is the county seat of Cook County , the second-most-populous county in the US , with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport . Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",
  "/wiki/Chicago_Tribune": "The Chicago Tribune is a daily newspaper based in Chicago , Illinois , United States , owned by Tribune Publishing . Founded in 1847 , and formerly self-styled as the World 's Greatest Newspaper ( a slogan for which WGN radio and television are named ) , it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region . It had the 6th highest circulation for American newspapers in 2017 . In the 1850s , under Joseph Medill , the Chicago Tribune became closely associated with Illinois ' favorite son , Abraham Lincoln , and with the Republican Party . In the 20th century under Medill 's grandson , Robert R. McCormick , it achieved a reputation as a crusading paper with a decidedly American conservative anti-New Deal outlook , and its writing reached other markets through family and corporate relationships at the New York Daily News and the Washington Times-Herald . The 1960s saw its corporate parent owner , Tribune Company , reach into new markets . In 2008 , for the first time in its over century-and-a-half history , its editorial page endorsed a Democrat , Illinoisan Barack Obama , for U.S. president . Originally published solely as a broadsheet , on January 13 , 2009 , the Tribune announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery , but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand , news box , and commuter station sales . This change , however , proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011 , the Tribune discontinued the tabloid edition , returning to its established broadsheet format through all distribution channels . In December 2019 , Alden Global Capital , a New York City-based hedge fund , acquired a 32% stake in shares of Tribune Publishing Company .

  "/wiki/Hippies": "A hippie ( sometimes spelled hippy ) is a member of the counterculture of the 1960s , originally a youth movement that began in the United States during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world . The word hippie came from hipster and was used to describe beatniks who moved into New York City 's Greenwich Village and San Francisco 's Haight-Ashbury district . The term hippie first found popularity in San Francisco with Herb Caen , who was a journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle . The origins of the terms hip and hep are uncertain . By the 1940s , both had become part of African American jive slang and meant sophisticated ; currently fashionable ; fully up-to-date . The Beats adopted the term hip , and early hippies inherited the language and countercultural values of the Beat Generation . Hippies created their own communities , listened to psychedelic music , embraced the sexual revolution , and many used drugs such as marijuana and LSD to explore altered states of consciousness .",
  "/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s": "The counterculture of the 1960s was an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed throughout much of the Western world between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s . The aggregate movement gained momentum as the Civil Rights Movement continued to grow , and , with the expansion of the US government 's extensive military intervention in Vietnam , would later become , in the eyes of some , revolutionary . As the 1960s progressed , widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues , and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality , women 's rights , traditional modes of authority , experimentation with psychoactive drugs , and differing interpretations of the American Dream . Many key movements related to these issues were born or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s . As the era unfolded , new cultural forms and a dynamic subculture which celebrated experimentation , modern incarnations of Bohemianism , and the rise of the hippie and other alternative lifestyles emerged . This embrace of creativity is particularly notable in the works of British Invasion bands such as the Beatles and filmmakers whose works became far less restricted by censorship . Many other creative artists , authors , and thinkers , within and across many disciplines , helped define the counterculture movement . Everyday dressing experienced a decline of the suit and especially the wearing of hats . Dressing based around jeans , for both men and women , became an important fashion movement that has continued up to the present day ( 2020 ) , and likely into the future . Several factors distinguished the counterculture of the 1960s from the anti-authoritarian movements of previous eras . The post-World War II baby boom generated an unprecedented number of potentially disaffected young people as prospective participants in a rethinking of the direction of the United States and other democratic societies . Post-war affluence allowed many of the counterculture generation to move beyond a focus on the provision of the material necessities of life that had preoccupied their Depression-era parents .",
  "/wiki/Entrapment": "Entrapment is a practice whereby a law enforcement agent or agent of the state induces a person to commit a crime that the person would have otherwise been unlikely or unwilling to commit . It is the conception and planning of an offense by an officer or agent , and the procurement of its commission by one who would not have perpetrated it except for the trickery , persuasion or fraud of the officer or state agent . Police conduct rising to the level of entrapment is broadly discouraged and thus , in many jurisdictions , is available as a defense against criminal liability . Sting operations , through which police officers or agents engage in deception to try to catch persons who are committing crimes , raise concerns about possible entrapment . Depending on the law in the jurisdiction , the prosecution may be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not entrapped or the defendant may be required to prove that they were entrapped as an affirmative defense .",
