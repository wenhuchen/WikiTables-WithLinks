It originated with the life and teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad ( 1835-1908 ) , who claimed to have been divinely appointed as both the promised Mahdi ( Guided One ) and Messiah expected by Muslims to appear towards the end times and bring about , by peaceful means , the final triumph of Islam ; as well as to embody , in this capacity , the expected eschatological figure of other major religious traditions . Adherents of the Ahmadiyya - a term adopted expressly in reference to Muhammad 's alternative name A\u1e25mad - are known as Ahmadi Muslims or simply Ahmadis . Ahmadi thought emphasizes the belief that Islam is the final dispensation for humanity as revealed to Muhammad and the necessity of restoring it to its true intent and pristine form , which had been lost through the centuries . Its adherents consider Ahmad to have appeared as the Mahdi - bearing the qualities of Jesus in accordance with their reading of scriptural prophecies - to revitalize Islam and set in motion its moral system that would bring about lasting peace . They believe that upon divine guidance he purged Islam of foreign accretions in belief and practice by championing what is , in their view , Islam 's original precepts as practised by Muhammad and the early Muslim community . Ahmadis thus view themselves as leading the propagation and renaissance of Islam . Mirza Ghulam Ahmad established the Community ( or Jam\u0101\u02bfat ) on 23 March 1889 by formally accepting allegiance from his supporters . Since his death , the Community has been led by a number of Caliphs and has spread to 210 countries and territories of the world as of 2017 with concentrations in South Asia , West Africa , East Africa , and Indonesia . The Ahmadis have a strong missionary tradition and formed the first Muslim missionary organization to arrive in Britain and other Western countries . Currently , the Community is led by its Caliph , Mirza Masroor Ahmad , and is estimated to number between 10 and 20 million worldwide . The population is almost entirely contained in the single , highly organized and united movement .",
