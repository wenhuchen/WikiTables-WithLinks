  "/wiki/Castle_Shannon_Incline": "The Castle Shannon Incline was a funicular railroad in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . It was originally part of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad route to the suburb of Castle Shannon . It replaced an earlier incline dating to 1825 that brought coal down from a mine in Mount Washington . Initially opened on 26 August 1890 , the incline operated for only a few days before breaking down , the original machinery being unable to bear the strain of the large freight and passenger cars . After a second abortive run in October , it was decided that the machinery had to be replaced . The refitted incline opened on 7 March 1891 . It ran from Bailey Avenue west of Haberman Avenue down to Carson Street just west of Arlington Avenue . The oldest part of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad was a coal mine in Mount Washington . When the mine was played out in 1861 , the company opened the back ( south ) side of the mine and continued it down a horseshoe curve into the Saw Mill Run valley to other coal mines . The company began passenger service in 1874 to develop towns at Fair Haven ( Overbrook ) and Castle Shannon . Trains ran up the old incline , through the enlarged coal mine tunnel , down the slope and horseshoe curve , and through the valley . Improvements starting in 1890 replaced the route over Mount Washington with the new incline , which became known as Castle Shannon Incline No .",

  "/wiki/Pittsburgh_and_Castle_Shannon_Railroad": "The Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad was a 3 ft 4 in ( 1,016 mm ) narrow-gauge railroad in Allegheny County , Pennsylvania . Originally built in 1871 , it may have been the first American common-carrier narrow-gauge railroad . It purchased a rail line called the Coal Hill Coal Railroad from the Pittsburgh Coal Company , and used a coal mine under Mt . Washington as a tunnel to transport coal from Castle Shannon , Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh . Passenger traffic was added soon afterwards , and the train carried passengers during the day and coal at night . The original plan was to extend the line to Finleyville , Pennsylvania , but the original narrow-gauge line ran only as far as Castle Shannon . The right of way continued as the Pittsburgh , Castle Shannon and Washington Railroad , later to become part of the Pittsburgh Southern Railroad . In spite of its location above the rivers in Pittsburgh , it sustained flood damage on at least one occasion . The Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel was closed to passenger traffic in 1880 , but coal trains continued to use it until 1912 . Passengers continued to travel over Mt . Washington via two inclines , the Castle Shannon Incline and a back incline . The right of way , excluding the tunnel through the coal mine , was leased by Pittsburgh Railways in 1905 , and later purchased in 1950 .",
  "/wiki/Castle_Shannon_Incline_No._2": "Castle Shannon Incline Number 2 was an inclined cable railway in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . It was originally designed by Samuel Diescher , and opened in 1892 as part of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad as a means of transporting passenger traffic over Mt . Washington in concert with the Castle Shannon Incline ( called Incline No . 1 while this one was still in service ) . From the top station at Bailey Street , adjacent to the Castle Shannon Incline top station , No . 2 ran down hill west of Haberman Avenue , ending at Warrington Avenue . In 1891 Street Railway Journal described No . 2 as more of the nature of a cable road than an inclined plane because an endless cable is used to draw a train of cars . The drop was only 185 feet in 2112 feet , with varying degrees of descent . Before completion of the two Castle Shannon inclines , passenger service was run up the south slope on a route involving a horseshoe curve ( north of Warrington Avenue and west of Haberman Avenue ) and a tunnel that was originally a coal mine , and at the top passengers changed to an older incline to travel down to Carson Street . Coal trains continued to use the old route including the old incline . In the Street Railway Journal account , No .",
  "/wiki/Clifton_Incline_(Pittsburgh)": "The Clifton Incline was a funicular that operated from 1889 to 1905 in what is now the Perry Hilltop neighborhood of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . It extended from its base at Sarah Street ( now Strauss Street ) at the intersection with Myrtle Street ( now the closed Metcalf Street ) to its top landing at Clifton Park near the end of Clifton Street ( now Chautauqua Street ) . Businessman William McCreery co-founded the incline to facilitate access to a residential neighborhood developed from his former estate . The Clifton Avenue Incline Plane Company , formed for the purpose of erecting and operating the incline , was chartered on June 25 , 1888 . Within a year of that date , McCreery offered free incline rides to property auctions on the hill . There were two cars , only one of which carried passengers , the other one being a dummy car serving as a counterweight . A single operator performed the duties of engineer , conductor , and fireman . The incline closed after an accident on November 10 , 1905 , in which the passenger car - empty at the time - broke loose , hurtled down the track , plowed through the waiting room on Sarah Street and smashed into the front steps of a house .",
  "/wiki/Perry_Hilltop": "Perry South ( also known as Perry Hilltop ) is a neighborhood on Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 's North Side . The neighborhood takes its name from Perrysville Avenue , which was a part of the Venango trail , an Indian path leading north of 'Allegheny Town ' . Commodore Perry used the Trail to carry supplies from Pittsburgh to Erie for his lake battle against the British during the War of 1812 . Perrysville Avenue is an extension of Federal Street , the main north-south thoroughfare of old Allegheny City . Federal Street ends , and Perrysville Avenue begins , where the flat river plain gives way to a steep hill . Perry South is thus a hilltop neighborhood that runs along Perrysville Avenue from the river plain ( on the south ) to Riverview Park ( on the north ) . The hill on which the neighborhood is built provides natural borders to the west ( the Charles Street valley ) , to the east ( the East Street valley ) , and to the south ( Pleasant Valley ) . The neighborhood was developed as a streetcar suburb , so it consists almost exclusively of residential housing , with a small business district at the intersection of Perrysville Avenue and Charles Avenue . It experienced white flight after 1960 : from 1960 to 1970 , the neighborhood 's total population declined from 16,000 people to 13,000 , while its African-American population , which had formerly been located almost exclusively in the Charles Street valley , increased from 15% to 20% . From 1970 to 2000 , the total population decreased to just 5,200 people , of whom 65% were African-American . Current residents have formed the Perry South Citizens Council in an effort to prevent decay and to improve the neighborhood 's business district . The southwestern corner of the neighborhood was once called Pleasant Valley , a small area that was nevertheless once considered to be a neighborhood in its own right .",

Designed by Samuel Diescher , the incline measured 840 feet in length with a vertical rise of 330 feet . Though not especially large in those dimensions in comparison with other Pittsburgh inclines , it was structurally massive , with over 750 tons of bridge work carrying the two 10-foot-gauge tracks over the Pennsylvania Railroad yards , Bigelow Boulevard , and Liberty Avenue . The incline was conceived with the aim of hoisting 20-ton coal loads to the top of the hill . The coal traffic never materialized to expectations , but railroad and business activity in the Strip District generated enough passengers and freight to keep the incline operating . Customers included produce merchants transporting their goods from wholesale markets in the Strip . A saloon and entertainment hall called the Penn Incline Resort existed for several years next to the upper landing . This resort , patterned after similar hilltop attractions in Cincinnati , was built together with the incline to boost business . It enjoyed early popularity and according to the The Pittsburg Dispatch was a favorite resort for the better class of Germans .

The incline was 2,060 ft ( 628 m ) long , with a vertical rise of 361 ft ( 110 m ) . It was designed by engineer J. H. McRoberts . As it carried both freight and passengers over steep tracks laid on the ground , it could be considered to be a cable railway . Its path was not of constant slope but became progressively steeper toward the top , tracing a parabolic arc .
