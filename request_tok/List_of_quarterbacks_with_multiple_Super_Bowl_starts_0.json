The league entered talks with the National Football League regarding an NFL-AFL merger , which took effect fully in 1970 . The season also saw the debut of the Miami Dolphins .

The National Football League ( NFL ) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League ( AFL ) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35-10 .

The Packers finished the 1966 NFL season at 12-2 , and defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34-27 in the NFL Championship Game . Still , many sports writers and fans believed any team in the older NFL was vastly superior to any club in the upstart AFL , and so expected Green Bay would blow out Kansas City . The first half of Super Bowl I was competitive , as the Chiefs outgained the Packers in total yards , 181-164 , to come within 14-10 at halftime . Early in the 3rd quarter , Green Bay safety Willie Wood intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards to the 5-yard line . The turnover sparked the Packers to score 21 unanswered points in the second half . Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr , who completed 16 of 23 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns , with one interception , was named MVP .
