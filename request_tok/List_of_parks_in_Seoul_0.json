  "/wiki/Dongmyo": "Dongmyo ( which literally means Eastern Shrine ) is a shrine in metropolitan Seoul built in honour of the 3rd century Chinese military commander , Guan Yu . The Joseon government embarked on construction in 1599 and completed the work in 1601 . The Wanli Emperor of Ming provided funds for construction of the shrine , along with a plaque with his own calligraphy . Three shrines - Dongmyo ( east shrine ) , Seomyo ( west shrine ) and Bungmyo ( north shrine ) - were actually constructed in 1601 . However , only Dongmyo Shrine remains today . There was no such practice as worshipping Guan Yu as a deity in Korea until Ming Dynasty military officers brought the custom during the military campaigns against Japan . As Neo-Confucian fundamentalists , Korean officers found it unacceptable to worship Guan Yu , but were unable to refuse the Chinese request for enshrinement . The construction was a burden to exhausted postwar Korea and the shrine was maintained only with concern for the relationship with China . Koreans remained indifferent toward these shrines for a long time . But during the reign of King Yeongjo ( 1724-1776 ) , Dongmyo and Nammyo ( another shrine constructed by Ming military official Zhen Yin ) were incorporated into state rituals for the purpose of Ming worship linked with hostility toward and contempt for Manchu Qing Dynasty . The shrine is surrounded by a wall of stone and mud , and covers an area of 9,315 m\u00b2 . Ceremonies were held here for many years to thank Guan Yu for divine support .",
