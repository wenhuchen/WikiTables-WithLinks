  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people , usually wearing protective gloves , throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring . Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games - it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing , disqualification of an opponent , or resignation of an opponent . When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing , the judges ' scorecards determine the victor . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , professional bouts are considered a draw . In Olympic boxing , because a winner must be declared , judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria . While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history , the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC . The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece , where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules .",
  "/wiki/Kickboxer": "Kickboxing is a group of stand-up combat sports based on kicking and punching , historically developed from karate mixed with boxing . Kickboxing is practiced for self-defence , general fitness , or as a contact sport . Japanese kickboxing originated in the late 1950s , with competitions held since then . American kickboxing originated in the 1970s and was brought to prominence in September 1974 , when the Professional Karate Association ( PKA ) held the first World Championships . Historically , kickboxing can be considered a hybrid martial art formed from the combination of elements of various traditional styles . This approach became increasingly popular since the 1970s , and since the 1990s , kickboxing has contributed to the emergence of mixed martial arts via further hybridization with ground fighting techniques from Brazilian jiu-jitsu and folk wrestling . There is no single international governing body . International governing bodies include the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations , World Kickboxing Association , International Sport Karate Association , International Kickboxing Federation , and World Kickboxing Network , among others . Consequently , there is no single kickboxing world championship , and champion titles are issued by individual promotions , such as Glory , SUPERKOMBAT , ONE FC , K-1 and Kunlun Fight among others .

  "/wiki/Mixed_martial_artist": "Mixed martial arts ( MMA ) , also known as cage fighting , is a full-contact combat sport that allows striking and grappling , both standing and on the ground , using techniques from various combat sports and martial arts . The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993 . The term gained popularity when newfullcontact.com , then one of the largest websites covering the sport , hosted and republished the article . The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate . During the early 20th century , various interstylistic contests took place throughout Japan and in the countries of the Four Asian Tigers . In Brazil , there was the sport of Vale Tudo , in which fighters from various styles fought with little to no rules . The Gracie family was known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian jiu-jitsu style . An early high-profile mixed martial arts bout was fought in 1951 , between the judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu-jitsu founder H\u00e9lio Gracie in Brazil . In the West , the concept of combining elements of multiple martial arts was popularized by Bruce Lee 's Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s to early 1970s . A precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki bout , fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan , where it later inspired the foundation of Pancrase in 1993 and Pride Fighting Championships in 1997 . In 1980 , CV Productions , Inc. created the first regulated MMA league in the United States , called Tough Guy Contest , which was later renamed Battle of the Superfighters .

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports .

The stable originated in World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) with the gimmick of a group of unsanctioned wrestlers aiming to take over and control WCW in the manner of a street gang . The group later appeared in the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) after the purchase of WCW by the WWF . The nWo angle became one of the most influential forces in the mid-to-late 1990s success of WCW and was instrumental in turning mainstream North American professional wrestling back into a more mature , adult-oriented product and became the main driving forces behind WCW topping WWF in the Monday Night Wars . Fueled initially by the unexpected villainous turn of Hulk Hogan , the nWo storyline is generally considered one of the most successful angles in the history of modern-day professional wrestling , spawning several imitations and parodies , including groups such as the bWo , lWo and jWo . The group dominated WCW programming throughout the late-1990s and continued its domination until the dissolution of WCW in 2001 , during which time there were several , sometimes rival incarnations of the group . In December 2019 , it was announced that the nWo would be inducted into the 2020 WWE Hall of Fame , with Hogan , Hall , Nash , and Sean Waltman as the inducted members .",

Teen pop singers often cultivate an image of a girl next door/boy next door . According to AllMusic , teen pop is essentially dance-pop , pop , and urban ballads that are marketed to teens , and was conceived in its contemporary form during the late 1980s and 1990s , pointing out the late 1990s as arguably the style 's golden era . About.com 's Bill Lamb described teen pop sound as a simple , straightforward , ultra-catchy melody line [ . ] The songs may incorporate elements of other pop music genres , but usually they will never be mistaken for anything but mainstream pop . The music is designed for maximum focus on the performer and a direct appeal to listeners . Some authors deemed teen pop music as more disposable , less intellectually challenging , more feminine , simpler and more commercially focused than other musical forms . Author Melanie Lowe wrote that teen pop is marked by a clash of presumed innocence and overt sexuality , a conflict that mirrors the physical and emotional turmoil of its primary target audience and vital fan base : early-adolescent middle-and upper middle-class suburban girls .",
