  "/wiki/Nausica\u00e4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(manga)": "Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind ( Japanese : \u98a8\u306e\u8c37\u306e\u30ca\u30a6\u30b7\u30ab , Hepburn : Kaze no Tani no Naushika ) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by anime director Hayao Miyazaki . It tells the story of Nausica\u00e4 , a princess of a small kingdom on a post-apocalyptic Earth with a toxic ecological system , who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an environmental disaster threatens humankind . Prior to creating Nausica\u00e4 , Miyazaki had worked as an animator for Toei Animation , Nippon Animation and Tokyo Movie Shinsha ( TMS ) , the latter for whom he had directed his feature film debut , Lupin III : The Castle of Cagliostro ( 1979 ) . After working on an aborted adaptation of Richard Corben 's Rowlf for TMS and the publishing firm Tokuma Shoten , he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma 's monthly magazine Animage , initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film . Nausica\u00e4 was influenced by the Japanese folk tale The Princess who Loved Insects , a similarly-named character from Homer 's Odyssey , the Minamata Bay mercury pollution , and various works of science fiction and fantasy by Western writers , among other sources . The manga was serialized intermittently in Animage from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven tank\u014dbon volumes . It was serialized with an English translation in North America by Viz Media from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 comic book issues and has been published in collected form multiple times . Since its initial serialization , Nausica\u00e4 has become a commercial success , particularly in Japan , where at least 11 million copies have been sold . The manga and the 1984 film adaptation , written and directed by Miyazaki following the serialization of the manga 's first sixteen chapters , received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters , themes , and art . The manga and film versions of Nausica\u00e4 are also credited for the foundation of Studio Ghibli , the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works .",

  "/wiki/Homer": "Homer ( /\u02c8ho\u028am\u0259r/ ; Ancient Greek : \u1f4d\u03bc\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Greek pronunciation : [ h\u00f3m\u025b\u02d0ros ] , H\u00f3m\u0113ros ) is the legendary author of the Iliad and the Odyssey , two epic poems that are the central works of ancient Greek literature . The Iliad is set during the Trojan War , the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek kingdoms . It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war . The Odyssey focuses on the ten-year journey home of Odysseus , king of Ithaca , after the fall of Troy . Many accounts of Homer 's life circulated in classical antiquity , the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia , a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey . Modern scholars consider these accounts legendary . The Homeric Question - concerning by whom , when , where and under what circumstances the Iliad and Odyssey were composed - continues to be debated . Broadly speaking , modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups . One holds that most of the Iliad and ( according to some ) the Odyssey are the works of a single poet of genius . The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and reworking by many contributors , and that Homer is best seen as a label for an entire tradition . It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC . The poems are in Homeric Greek , also known as Epic Greek , a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries ; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic .",
  "/wiki/Odyssey": "The Odyssey ( /\u02c8\u0252d\u0259si/ ; Greek : \u1f48\u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 Od\u00fdsseia , pronounced [ o.d\u00fds.sej.ja ] in Classical Attic ) is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer . It is , in part , a sequel to the Iliad , the other Homeric epic . The Odyssey is fundamental to the modern Western canon ; it is the second-oldest extant work of Western literature , while the Iliad is the oldest . Scholars believe the Odyssey was composed near the end of the 8th century BC , somewhere in Ionia , the Greek coastal region of Anatolia . The poem mainly focuses on the Greek hero Odysseus ( known as Ulysses in Roman myths ) , king of Ithaca , and his journey home after the fall of Troy . It takes Odysseus ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War . In his absence , it is assumed Odysseus has died , and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus must deal with a group of unruly suitors , the Mnesteres ( Greek : \u039c\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 ) or Proci , who compete for Penelope 's hand in marriage . The Odyssey continues to be read in the Homeric Greek and translated into modern languages around the world . Many scholars believe the original poem was composed in an oral tradition by an aoidos ( epic poet/singer ) , perhaps a rhapsode ( professional performer ) , and was more likely intended to be heard than read . The details of the ancient oral performance and the story 's conversion to a written work inspire continual debate among scholars . The Odyssey was written in a poetic dialect of Greek - a literary amalgam of Aeolic Greek , Ionic Greek , and other Ancient Greek dialects - and comprises 12,110 lines of dactylic hexameter . Among the most noteworthy elements of the text are its non-linear plot , and the influence on events of choices made by women and slaves , besides the actions of fighting men .",

  "/wiki/Princess_Knight": "Princess Knight , also known as Ribon no Kishi , [ a ] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Osamu Tezuka . This manga follows the adventures of Sapphire , a girl who was born accidentally with a blue heart of a boy and a pink heart of a girl . She pretends to be a male prince to prevent the evil Duke Duralumin from inheriting the throne of Silverland . The gender-bending main character was inspired by the all-female musical theater group Takarazuka Revue in which women performed both female and male roles . The story was ordered by one editor of Kodansha 's magazine Sh\u014djo Club who wanted Tezuka to produced a manga aimed towards a female audience that could replicate the success of his former boy-aimed stories . The author then created Princess Knight , originally serialized in that magazine from 1953 to 1956 . The manga 's popularity resulted into a radio dramatization in 1955 , three other serializations between 1958 and 1968 , and a 52-episode television anime series by Mushi Production that aired on Fuji TV from 1967 to 1968 . It has also influenced several stage musicals since the 1980s and inspired remakes of the work by other authors . The series ' arrival in the English-speaking market was delayed by NBC Enterprises executives ' perception that it could be interpreted as sex switch . However , still in the 1970s , the television series got a dubbed version produced by Joe Oriolo . Renamed Choppy and the Princess , it was released to American , Australian , and British television audiences , with home video releases to follow . The manga would only reach the anglophone public years later , in 2001 when Kodansha International published a bilingual edition of Princess Knight , which was followed by a newer version by Vertical in 2011 .",
