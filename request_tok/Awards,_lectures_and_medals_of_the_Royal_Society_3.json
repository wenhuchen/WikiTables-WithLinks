  "/wiki/Buchanan_Medal": "The Buchanan Medal is awarded by the Royal Society in recognition of distinguished contribution to the medical sciences generally . The award was created in 1897 from a fund to the memory of London physician Sir George Buchanan ( 1831-1895 ) . It was to be awarded once every five years , but since 1990 the medal has been awarded every two years . Since its creation , it has been awarded 28 times , and unlike other Royal Society medals such as the Royal Medal , it has never been awarded to the same individual multiple times . As a result of the criteria for the medal , most of the winners have been doctors or other medical professionals ; an exception was Frederick Warner , an engineer who won the medal in 1982 for his important role in reducing pollution of the River Thames and of his significant contributions to risk assessment . Two winners have also won a Nobel Prize . The first , Barry Marshall , who was awarded the Buchanan Medal in 1998 in recognition of his work on discovering the role of Helicobacter pylori as a cause of diseases such as duodenal ulcer , gastric ulcer , gastric cancer and gastritis-associated dyspepsia and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005 . The second , Peter Ratcliffe , won the medal in 2017 for his ground-breaking research on oxygen sensing and signalling pathways mediating cellular responses to hypoxia , and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2019https : //www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2019/ratcliffe/facts/ . The first winner of the Buchanan Medal was John Simon , who won his medal in 1897 for his distinguished services as an organizer of medical sanitary administration in this country , and as a promoter of scientific research relating to public health .",

It is subdivided into 100 pence ( singular : penny , abbreviated : p ) . The Pound sterling is the oldest currency in continuous use . A number of nations that do not use sterling also have currencies called the pound . Sterling is the fourth most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market , after the United States dollar , the euro , and the Japanese yen . Together with those three currencies and the Chinese yuan , it forms the basket of currencies which calculate the value of IMF special drawing rights . As of 30 September 2019 [ update ] , sterling is also the fifth most-held reserve currency in global reserves . The British Crown dependencies of Guernsey , Jersey and the Isle of Man produce their own local issues of sterling ( the Guernsey pound , the Jersey pound and the Manx pound ) which are considered fully equivalent to UK sterling in their respective regions . The pound sterling is also used in Gibraltar ( alongside the Gibraltar pound ) , the Falkland Islands ( alongside the Falkland Islands pound ) , Saint Helena and Ascension Island in Saint Helena , Ascension and Tristan da Cunha ( alongside the Saint Helena pound ) . The Bank of England is the central bank for the pound sterling , issuing its own banknotes , and regulating issuance of banknotes by private banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland .
