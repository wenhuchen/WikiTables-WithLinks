Along with textile tycoon Benjamin Bates , he founded the first coeducational university in New England ( the Bates College ) which is widely considered his magnum opus . Cheney is one of the most extensively covered subjects of Neoabolitionism , for his public denouncement of slavery , involuntary servitude , and advocation for fair and equal representation , egalitarianism , and personal sovereignty . Cheney 's main social ideology was that of egalitarianism ; he personally voiced his disdain for racial inequality , social elitism , and socioeconomic depravation regularly , in controversial speeches and articles . He was ordained a minister in his early twenties , became the headmaster at Parsonsfield , Maine , and illegally harbored and transferred slaves to safety during the 1840s in New Hampshire-an action punishable with a decade 's jail time by the federal Fugitive Slave acts . His religious community work garnered him widespread support , culminating in his nomination for a seat in the Maine House of Representatives without his knowledge . Having been told he was nominated and elected on his way to his induction ceremony , Cheney would go on to be an able Free Soil legislator . His first bills drafted and passed supported state prohibition , advocated for temperance , regulated liquor traffic ( notably the passage of the Maine Liquor Law ) , and provided the funds for his first school-the Lebanon Academy in Lebanon , Maine . He gave many abolitionist speeches to the legislature , which produced mixed reactions and death threats ; historians have occasionally noted him as completely and utterly careless with his life . He was elected as the only delegate to attend the 1852 Free Soil Party Convention in Pittsburgh from Maine , where he famously advocated for anti-slavery , and physically threatened the owner of a local tavern for refusing to serve Frederick Douglass , a noted abolitionist and black member of the party . After his political career , he continued to publish anti-slavery pieces in his newspaper , and establish the Maine State Seminary , which would later be named Bates College .

  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries .

As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) .
