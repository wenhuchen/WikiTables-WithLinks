  "/wiki/Coventry_Canal": "The canal starts at Coventry Canal Basin . The basin was opened in 1769 and expanded in 1788 . It is situated just north of Coventry City Centre and just outside the city 's inner ring road . Many of the buildings and the site were restored between 1993 and 1995 . The Canal Bridge , Canal House and the warehouses are grade II listed buildings . All boats going in and out of Coventry Canal Basin have to pass through the Canal Bridge . From the canal basin , the canal meanders north through Coventry passing under many road bridges including prominent hump-back bridges under the Foleshill Road , Foleshill through Little Heath and the Longford Road , Longford . Five miles north of Coventry , at Hawkesbury Junction , a superbly preserved iron bridge crosses the start of the Oxford Canal , which journeys southwards to join the River Thames at Oxford . At Hawkesbury Junction there are buildings from the working days of the canal , and the Greyhound pub is a traditional stop for boaters . Hawkesbury Junction is also known to regular boaters as Sutton Stop , though strictly this refers to the stop lock , a short distance along the Oxford Canal . A few miles north of Hawkesbury , just outside Bedworth , is Marston Junction , where the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal starts its meandering , rural and lock-free journey towards the former coal mines at Moira ; although it is now navigable only for 22 miles ( 35 km ) to Snarestone . From Marston Junction , the Coventry canal runs north-west through Nuneaton , Atherstone and Polesworth , to Tamworth .",

  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",
  "/wiki/Coventry_City_Council": "Coventry City Council is the local government body responsible for the governance of the City of Coventry in England , which has been a metropolitan district since 1974 . The city is divided up into 18 Wards each with three councillors . Coventry has usually been controlled by the Labour Party over the past few decades , and at times they appeared to be in safe control . However , the Conservatives held control for a short time in the 1970s , and they also held control from July 2004 until 2010 . For a time they held control on the casting vote of the Lord Mayor , but they won clear control at the local elections of 4 May 2006 . However , in 2010 the Conservatives lost control of Coventry City Council when Labour gained enough seats to have overall control . The leader of the Conservative group is Gary Ridley who has held the post since May 2017 after John Blundell , stood down . The leader of the controlling Labour group is George Duggins . He has held the post of Leader of the Council since May 2016 after winning a leadership election against the incumbent Ann Lucas . The Chief Executive is Martin Reeves . In 2017 the Council will move the majority of its staff to the Friargate development . It will be the first tenant in the new business district , located next to Coventry railway station .",

  "/wiki/Oak": "An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus ( /\u02c8kw\u025c\u02d0rk\u0259s/ ; ; Latin oak tree ) of the beech family , Fagaceae . There are approximately 600 extant species of oaks . The common name oak also appears in the names of species in related genera , notably Lithocarpus ( stone oaks ) , as well as in those of unrelated species such as Grevillea robusta ( silky oaks ) and the Casuarinaceae ( she-oaks ) . The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere , and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas , Asia , Europe , and North Africa . North America contains the largest number of oak species , with approximately 90 occurring in the United States , while Mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic . The second greatest center of oak diversity is China , which contains approximately 100 species .",
  "/wiki/Hawkesbury_Junction": "Hawkesbury Junction or Sutton Stop ( grid reference SP360846 ) is a canal junction in England , at the northern limit of the Oxford Canal where it meets the Coventry Canal , near Hawkesbury Village , Warwickshire , between Bedworth and Coventry . The alternative name , Sutton Stop , arises from the name of a family which provided several lock keepers there in the nineteenth century .",
  "/wiki/Journeyman": "A journeyman is a worker , skilled in a given building trade or craft , who has successfully completed an official apprenticeship qualification . Journeymen are considered competent and authorized to work in that field as a fully qualified employee . They earn their license by education , supervised experience and examination . Although journeymen have completed a trade certificate and are allowed to work as employees , they may not yet work as self-employed master craftsmen . The term journeyman was originally used in the medieval trade guilds . Journeymen were paid daily and the word journey is derived from journ\u00e9e , meaning day in French . Each individual guild generally recognised three ranks of workers : apprentices , journeymen , and masters . A journeyman , as a qualified tradesman could become a master and run their own business , but most continued working as employees . Guidelines were put in place to promote responsible tradesmen , who were held accountable for their own work and to protect the individual trade and the general public from unskilled workers . To become a master , a journeyman has to submit a master piece of work to a guild for evaluation . Only after evaluation can a journeyman be admitted to the guild as a master . Sometimes , a journeyman was required to accomplish a three-year working trip , which may be called the journeyman years .",
  "/wiki/Steel": "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements . Because of its high tensile strength and low cost , it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , trains , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel . Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic and face-centered cubic , depending on its temperature . In the body-centered cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell ; in the face-centered cubic , there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices . It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In pure iron , the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another , and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed . In steel , small amounts of carbon , other elements , and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight . Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements , as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel ( either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases ) , slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile , and thus controls and enhances its qualities . These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . The increase in steel 's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron 's ductility .",
  "/wiki/Daimler_Company": "The Daimler Company Limited , until 1910 , the Daimler Motor Company Limited , was an independent British motor vehicle manufacturer founded in London by H. J. Lawson in 1896 , which set up its manufacturing base in Coventry . The company bought the right to the use of the Daimler name simultaneously from Gottlieb Daimler and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft of Cannstatt , Germany . After early financial difficulty and a reorganisation of the company in 1904 , the Daimler Motor Company was purchased by Birmingham Small Arms Company ( BSA ) in 1910 , which also made cars under its own name before World War II . In 1933 , BSA bought the Lanchester Motor Company and made it a subsidiary of Daimler . Daimler was awarded a Royal Warrant to provide cars to the British Monarch in 1902 ; it lost this privilege in the 1950s after being supplanted by Rolls-Royce . Daimler occasionally used alternative technology : the Knight engine which it further developed in the early twentieth century and used from 1909 to 1935 , worm gear final drive fitted from 1909 until after the Second World War , and their patented fluid flywheel used in conjunction with a Wilson preselector gearbox from 1930 to the mid-1950s . In the 1950s , Daimler tried to widen its appeal with a line of smaller cars at one end and opulent show cars at the other , stopped making Lanchesters , had a highly publicised removal of their chairman from the board , and developed and sold a sports car and a high-performance luxury saloon and limousine . In 1960 , BSA sold Daimler to Jaguar Cars , which continued Daimler 's line and added a Daimler variant of its Mark II sports saloon . Jaguar was then merged into the British Motor Corporation in 1966 and British Leyland in 1968 . Under these companies , Daimler became an upscale trim level for Jaguar cars except for the 1968-1992 Daimler DS420 limousine , which had no Jaguar equivalent despite being fully Jaguar-based . When Jaguar Cars was split off from British Leyland in 1984 it retained the Daimler company and brand . In 1990 Ford Motor Company bought Jaguar Cars and under Ford it stopped using the Daimler marque in 2007 .",
  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume , and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite .",
