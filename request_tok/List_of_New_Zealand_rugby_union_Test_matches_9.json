Its name comes from D\u00f9n \u00c8ideann , the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh , the capital of Scotland . The urban area of Dunedin lies on the central-eastern coast of Otago , surrounding the head of Otago Harbour , and the harbour and hills around Dunedin are the remnants of an extinct volcano . The city suburbs extend out into the surrounding valleys and hills , onto the isthmus of the Otago Peninsula , and along the shores of the Otago Harbour and the Pacific Ocean . Dunedin was the largest New Zealand city by territorial land area until superseded by Auckland with the formation of the Auckland Council in November 2010 . Archaeological evidence points to lengthy occupation of the area by M\u0101ori prior to the arrival of Europeans . The province and region of Otago takes its name from the Ngai Tahu village of Otakou at the mouth of the harbour , which became a whaling station in the 1830s . In 1848 a Scottish settlement was established by the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland . Between 1855 and 1900 many thousands of Scots emigrated to the incorporated city . Dunedin became wealthy during the Central Otago Gold Rush , beginning in the 1860s . In the mid-1860s , and between 1878 and 1881 , it was New Zealand 's largest urban area . The city population at 5 March 2013 was 120,246 .",

Eden Park is considered one of rugby union 's most difficult assignments for visiting sides : New Zealand 's national rugby union team , the All Blacks , have been unbeaten at this venue for over 40 consecutive test matches stretching back to 1994 . Eden Park is the site of the 2021 Te Matatini . It will also be the site for 2021 Women 's Cricket World Cup and the final of the 2021 Women 's Rugby World Cup .",

It is located in the Auckland Region - the area governed by Auckland Council - which includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf , resulting in a total population of 1,618,400 . Auckland is a diverse , multicultural and cosmopolitan city , home to the largest Polynesian population in the world . The M\u0101ori-language name for Auckland is T\u0101maki Makaurau , meaning T\u0101maki desired by many , in reference to the desirability of its natural resources and geography . Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf of the Pacific Ocean to the east , the low Hunua Ranges to the south-east , the Manukau Harbour to the south-west , and the Waitakere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west . The surrounding hills are covered in rainforest and the landscape is dotted with dozens of dormant volcanic cones . The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitemat\u0101 Harbour on the Pacific Ocean . Auckland is one of the few cities in the world to have a harbour on each of two separate major bodies of water . The isthmus on which Auckland resides was first settled around 1350 and was valued for its rich and fertile land . The M\u0101ori population in the area is estimated to have peaked at 20,000 before the arrival of Europeans .

It is the administrative seat of the Loire-Atlantique department and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion , one of 18 regions of France . Nantes belongs historically and culturally to Brittany , a former duchy and province , and its omission from the modern administrative region of Brittany is controversial . Nantes was identified during classical antiquity as a port on the Loire . It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the Roman era before it was conquered by the Bretons in 851 . Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany , Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France . During the 17th century , after the establishment of the French colonial empire , Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the 18th-century French Atlantic slave trade . The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline , but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 ( chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing ) . Deindustrialisation in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy . In 2012 , the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Nantes as a Gamma world city .",
