It connects the White Sea , in the Arctic Ocean , with Lake Onega , which is further connected to the Baltic Sea . Until 1961 , its original name was the Stalin White Sea-Baltic Canal ( Belomorsko-Baltiyskiy Kanal imeni Stalina ) . The canal was constructed by forced labor of gulag inmates . Beginning and ending with a labor force of 126,000 , between 12,000 and 25,000 laborers died according to official records , while Anne Applebaum 's estimate is 25,000 deaths . The canal runs 227 kilometers ( 141 mi ) , partially along several canalized rivers and Lake Vygozero . As of 2008 , it carries only light traffic of between ten and forty boats per day . Its economic advantages are limited by its minimal depth of 3.5 m ( 11.5 ft ) , [ citation needed ] inadequate for most sea-going vessels . This depth typically corresponds to river craft with deadweight cargo up to 600 tonnes , while useful sea going vessels of 2,000-3,000 dwt typically have drafts of 4.5-6 m ( 15-20 ft ) . The canal was originally proposed to be 5.4 m ( 17.7 ft ) deep ; however , the cost and time constraints of Stalin 's First five-year plan forced the much shallower draught .",

The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",

The river begins in the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden in the southeastern Swiss Alps , forms part of the Swiss-Liechtenstein , Swiss-Austrian , Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border , then flows through the German Rhineland and the Netherlands and eventually empties into the North Sea . The largest city on the Rhine is Cologne , Germany , with a population of more than 1,050,000 people . It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe ( after the Danube ) , at about 1,230 km ( 760 mi ) , [ note 1 ] [ note 2 ] with an average discharge of about 2,900 m3/s ( 100,000 cu ft/s ) . The Rhine and the Danube formed most of the northern inland frontier of the Roman Empire and , since those days , the Rhine has been a vital and navigable waterway carrying trade and goods deep inland . Its importance as a waterway in the Holy Roman Empire is supported by the many castles and fortifications built along it . In the modern era , it has become a symbol of German nationalism . Among the biggest and most important cities on the Rhine are Cologne , D\u00fcsseldorf , Rotterdam , Strasbourg and Basel .",

  "/wiki/North_Sea": "The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain ( England and Scotland ) , Denmark , Norway , Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium and France . An epeiric ( or shelf ) sea on the European continental shelf , it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north . It is more than 970 kilometres ( 600 mi ) long and 580 kilometres ( 360 mi ) wide , with an area of 570,000 square kilometres ( 220,000 sq mi ) . The North Sea has long been the site of important European shipping lanes as well as a major fishery . The coast is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries , and more recently the sea has developed into a rich source of energy resources , including fossil fuels , wind , and early efforts in wave power . Historically , the North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs , particularly in Northern Europe . It was also important globally through the power northern Europeans projected worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era . The North Sea was the centre of the Vikings ' rise . Subsequently , the Hanseatic League , the Netherlands , and the British each sought to dominate the North Sea and thus access to the world 's markets and resources . As Germany 's only outlet to the ocean , the North Sea continued to be strategically important through both World Wars .

It is often considered to define the border between Africa and Asia . Constructed by the Suez Canal Company between 1859 and 1869 , it officially opened on 17 November 1869 . The canal offers watercraft a more direct route between the North Atlantic and northern Indian oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas , thus avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans and reducing the journey distance from the Arabian Sea to London , for example , by approximately 8,900 kilometres ( 5,500 mi ) . It extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city of Suez . Its length is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) including its northern and southern access-channels . In 2012 , 17,225 vessels traversed the canal ( an average of 47 per day ) . The original canal featured a single-lane waterway with passing locations in the Ballah Bypass and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no lock system , with seawater flowing freely through it . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . South of the lakes , the current changes with the tide at Suez . The United Kingdom and France owned the canal until July 1956 , when the President of Egypt , Gamal Abdel Nasser , nationalized it - an event which led to the Suez Crisis of October-November 1956 .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region .

The sea is bounded in the northwest by Ukraine , in the southeast by Russia . The Don River and Kuban River are the major rivers that flow into it . There is a constant outflow of water from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea . The Sea of Azov is the shallowest sea in the world , with the depth varying between 0.9 and 14 metres ( 2 ft 11 in and 45 ft 11 in ) . The sea is largely affected by the inflow of numerous rivers , which bring sand , silt , and shells , which in turn form numerous bays , limans , and narrow spits . Because of these deposits , the sea bottom is relatively smooth and flat with the depth gradually increasing toward the middle . Also , due to the river inflow , water in the sea has low salinity and a high amount of biomass ( such as green algae ) that affects the water colour . Abundant plankton result in unusually high fish productivity . The sea shores and spits are low ; they are rich in vegetation and bird colonies .",

The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation . Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment , Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits ( after New York City ) .",
  "/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico": "The Gulf of Mexico ( Spanish : Golfo de M\u00e9xico ) is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean , largely surrounded by the North American continent . It is bounded on the northeast , north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States , on the southwest and south by Mexico , and on the southeast by Cuba . The US states of Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida border the Gulf on the north , which are often referred to as the Third Coast , in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts . The Gulf of Mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics . The Gulf of Mexico basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nautical miles ( 1,500 km ; 930 mi ) wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments . It is connected to part of the Atlantic Ocean through the Florida Straits between the U.S. and Cuba , and with the Caribbean Sea ( with which it forms the American Mediterranean Sea ) via the Yucat\u00e1n Channel between Mexico and Cuba . With the narrow connection to the Atlantic , the Gulf experiences very small tidal ranges . The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 ( 615,000 sq mi ) . Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters . The basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters ( 550 quadrillion Imperial gallons , 660 quadrillion US gallons , 2.5 million km3 or 600,000 cu mi ) .

  "/wiki/Panama_Canal": "The Panama Canal ( Spanish : Canal de Panam\u00e1 ) is an artificial 82 km ( 51 mi ) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean . The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade . Canal locks are at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake , an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal , 26 m ( 85 ft ) above sea level , and then lower the ships at the other end . The original locks are 32.5 m ( 110 ft ) wide . A third , wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016 . The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26 , 2016 . The new locks allow transit of larger , neo-Panamax ships , capable of handling more cargo . The construction of the Panama Canal is where the expression Another Day , Another Dollar comes from , as the workers were rumored to be paid a dollar a day for their labor . France began work on the canal in 1881 , but stopped due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate . The United States took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15 , 1914 . One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken , the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , enabling them to avoid the lengthy , hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan and the even less popular route through the Arctic Archipelago and the Bering Strait .

The capital and largest city is Panama City , whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the country 's 4 million people . Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists arrived in the 16th century . It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia , a union of Nueva Granada , Ecuador , and Venezuela . After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831 , Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia . With the backing of the United States , Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 , allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914 . The 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties led to the transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama on December 31 , 1999 . Revenue from canal tolls continues to represent a significant portion of Panama 's GDP , although commerce , banking , and tourism are major and growing sectors . It is regarded as a high-income country . In 2018 Panama ranked 66th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index . In 2018 , Panama was ranked seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America , according to the World Economic Forum 's Global Competitiveness Index . Covering around 40 percent of its land area , Panama 's jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals - some of them found nowhere else on earth .",

  "/wiki/Manchester_Ship_Canal": "The Manchester Ship Canal is a 36-mile-long ( 58 km ) inland waterway in the North West of England linking Manchester to the Irish Sea . Starting at the Mersey Estuary near Liverpool , it generally follows the original routes of the rivers Mersey and Irwell through the historic counties of Cheshire and Lancashire . Several sets of locks lift vessels about 60 feet ( 18 m ) up to Manchester , where the canal 's terminus was built . Major landmarks along its route include the Barton Swing Aqueduct , the only swing aqueduct in the world , and Trafford Park , the world 's first planned industrial estate and still the largest in Europe . The rivers Mersey and Irwell were first made navigable in the early 18th century . Goods were also transported on the Runcorn extension of the Bridgewater Canal ( from 1776 ) and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway ( from 1830 ) , but by the late 19th century the Mersey and Irwell Navigation had fallen into disrepair and was often unusable . In addition , Manchester 's business community viewed the charges imposed by Liverpool 's docks and the railway companies as excessive . A ship canal was therefore proposed as a way of giving ocean-going vessels direct access to Manchester . The region was suffering from the effects of the Long Depression , and for the canal 's proponents , who argued that the scheme would boost competition and create jobs , the idea of a ship canal made sound economic sense . They initiated a public campaign to enlist support for the scheme , which was first presented to Parliament as a bill in 1882 . Faced with stiff opposition from Liverpool , the canal 's supporters were unable to gain the necessary Act of Parliament to allow the scheme to go ahead until 1885 . Construction began in 1887 ; it took six years and cost \u00a315 million ( equivalent to about \u00a31.65 billion in 2011 [ a ] ) .",

Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west .
