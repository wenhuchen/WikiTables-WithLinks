  "/wiki/Cyclist": "Cycling , also called biking or bicycling , is the use of bicycles for transport , recreation , exercise or sport . People engaged in cycling are referred to as cyclists , bikers , or less commonly , as bicyclists . Apart from two-wheeled bicycles , cycling also includes the riding of unicycles , tricycles , quadracycles , recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles ( HPVs ) . Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide . They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world . Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances . Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles , including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling , easier parking , increased maneuverability , and access to roads , bike paths and rural trails . Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels , less air or noise pollution , and much reduced traffic congestion . These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large ( negligible damage to roads , less road area required ) . By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses , transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve . In addition , cycling provides a variety of health benefits . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers , heart disease , and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles .",
