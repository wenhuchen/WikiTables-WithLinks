  "/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act": "The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization . The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing , closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to , for example , murder , to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally . RICO was enacted by section 901 ( a ) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 ( Pub.L . 91-452 , 84 Stat . 922 , enacted October 15 , 1970 ) and is codified at 18 U.S.C . ch . 96 as 18 U.S.C . \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 . G. Robert Blakey , an adviser to the United States Senate Government Operations Committee , drafted the law under the close supervision of the committee 's chairman , Senator John Little McClellan . It was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 , and signed into law by Richard M. Nixon . While its original use in the 1970s was to prosecute the Mafia as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime , its later application has been more widespread . Beginning in 1972 , 33 states adopted state RICO laws to be able to prosecute similar conduct .",
