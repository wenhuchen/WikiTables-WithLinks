  "/wiki/Brittle_(food)": "Brittle is a type of confection consisting of flat broken pieces of hard sugar candy embedded with nuts such as pecans , almonds , or peanuts . It has many variations around the world , such as pasteli in Greece , croquant in France , gozinaki in Georgia , gachak in Indian Punjab , chikki in other parts of India , kotkoti in Bangladesh [ citation needed ] , Huasheng tang ( \u82b1\u751f\u7cd6 ) in China , Thua Tat ( \u0e16\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e15\u0e31\u0e14 ) in Thailand and k\u1eb9o l\u1ea1c in Vietnam . In parts of the Middle East , brittle is made with pistachios , while many Asian countries use sesame seeds and peanuts . Peanut brittle is the most popular brittle recipe in the US . The term brittle first appears in print in 1892 , though the candy itself has been around for much longer . Traditionally , a mixture of sugar and water is heated to the hard crack stage corresponding to a temperature of approximately 300 \u00b0F ( 149 \u00b0C ) , although some recipes also call for ingredients such as corn syrup and salt in the first step . Nuts are mixed with the caramelized sugar . At this point spices , leavening agents , and often peanut butter or butter are added . The hot candy is poured out onto a flat surface for cooling , traditionally a granite or marble slab . The hot candy may be troweled to uniform thickness . When the brittle cools , it is broken into pieces .",
  "/wiki/Sugar": "Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting , soluble carbohydrates , many of which are used in food . Simple sugars , also called monosaccharides , include glucose , fructose , and galactose . Compound sugars , also called disaccharides or double sugars , are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond . Common examples are sucrose ( glucose + fructose ) , lactose ( glucose + galactose ) , and maltose ( two molecules of glucose ) . In the body , compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars . Table sugar , granulated sugar or regular sugar refers to sucrose , a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose . Longer chains of monosaccharides are not regarded as sugars , and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides . Some other chemical substances , such as glycerol and sugar alcohols , may have a sweet taste , but are not classified as sugar . Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants . Honey and fruit are abundant natural sources of unbounded simple sugars . Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet , making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar . In 2016 , the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes .",
  "/wiki/Pecan": "The pecan /p\u026a\u02c8k\u00e6n/ ( Carya illinoinensis ) is a species of hickory native to northern Mexico and the southern United States in the region of the Mississippi River . The tree is cultivated for its seed in the southern United States , primarily in Georgia , and in Mexico which produces nearly half of the world total . The seed is an edible nut used as a snack and in various recipes , such as praline candy and pecan pie . The pecan , in various aspects , is included in state symbols of Alabama , Arkansas , California , Oklahoma and Texas .",
  "/wiki/Almond": "The almond ( Prunus dulcis , syn . Prunus amygdalus ) is a species of tree native to Iran and surrounding countries but widely cultivated elsewhere . The almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree . Within the genus Prunus , it is classified with the peach in the subgenus Amygdalus , distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell ( endocarp ) surrounding the seed . The fruit of the almond is a drupe , consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed , which is not a true nut , inside . Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed . Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled . Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat , which is then removed to reveal the white embryo .",
  "/wiki/Peanut": "The peanut , also known as the groundnut , goober ( US ) , or monkey nut ( UK ) , and taxonomically classified as Arachis hypogaea , is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds . It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics , being important to both small and large commercial producers . It is classified as both a grain legume and , due to its high oil content , an oil crop . World annual production of shelled peanuts was 44 million tonnes in 2016 , led by China with 38% of the world total . Atypically among legume crop plants , peanut pods develop underground ( geocarpy ) rather than above ground . With this characteristic in mind , the botanist Carl Linnaeus named the species hypogaea , which means under the earth . As a legume , the peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae ; this is also known as Leguminosae , and commonly known as the bean , or pea , family . Like most other legumes , peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules . This capacity to fix nitrogen means peanuts require less nitrogen-containing fertilizer and also improve soil fertility , making them valuable in crop rotations . Peanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds , and as a culinary nut are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines . The botanical definition of a nut is a fruit whose ovary wall becomes hard at maturity . Using this criterion , the peanut is not a typical nut .",

Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

They are usually round , and usually range from 1 to 3 cm ( 0.4 to 1.2 in ) across ; though gobstoppers can be up to 8 cm ( 3.1 in ) in diameter . The term gobstopper derives from gob , which is slang in the United Kingdom and Ireland for mouth . The sweet was a favourite among British schoolboys between World War I and World War II . In his 1964 children 's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , British author Roald Dahl described Everlasting Gobstoppers , a fictional type of gobstopper that could never get smaller or be finished . Gobstoppers usually consist of a number of layers , each layer dissolving to reveal a differently coloured ( and sometimes differently flavoured ) layer , before dissolving completely . Gobstoppers are too hard to bite without risking dental damage ( hence the name jawbreaker ) . Gobstoppers have been sold in traditional sweet shops for at least a century , often sold by weight from jars . As gobstoppers dissolve very slowly , they last a very long time in the mouth , which is a major factor in their enduring popularity with children . Larger ones can take days or even weeks to fully dissolve .",

The majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages , including the Maya and Aztecs . The word chocolate is derived from the Classical Nahuatl word chocol\u0101tl . The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor . After fermentation , the beans are dried , cleaned , and roasted . The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs , which are then ground to cocoa mass , unadulterated chocolate in rough form . Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating , it is called chocolate liquor . The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components : cocoa solids and cocoa butter . Baking chocolate , also called bitter chocolate , contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions , without any added sugar . Powdered baking cocoa , which contains more fiber than it contains cocoa butter , can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa .

Jewish ethnicity , nationhood , and religion are strongly interrelated , as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people , while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance . Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE , in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel . The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE ( Late Bronze Age ) . The Israelites , as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews ' . Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail , the experience of diaspora life , from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant , to Assyrian captivity and exile , to Babylonian captivity and exile , to Seleucid Imperial rule , to the Roman occupation and exile , and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter , became a major feature of Jewish history , identity and memory . Prior to World War II , the worldwide Jewish population reached a peak of 16.7 million , representing around 0.7% of the world population at that time . Approximately 6 million Jews were systematically murdered during the Holocaust .

The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word coco , meaning 'head ' or 'skull ' after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features . Coconuts are known for their versatility of uses , ranging from food to cosmetics . The inner flesh of the mature seed , as well as the coconut milk extracted from it , forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics . Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid , called coconut water or coconut juice . Mature , ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds , or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh , charcoal from the hard shell , and coir from the fibrous husk . Dried coconut flesh is called copra , and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking - frying in particular - as well as in soaps and cosmetics . The hard shells , fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decorating . The coconut also has cultural and religious significance in certain societies , particularly in India , where it is used in Hindu rituals .",
  "/wiki/Fudge": "Fudge is a type of sugar candy that is made by mixing sugar , butter and milk , heating it to the soft-ball stage at 240 \u00b0F ( 116 \u00b0C ) , and then beating the mixture while it cools so that it acquires a smooth , creamy consistency . In texture , this crystalline candy falls in between fondants and hard caramels . Fruits , nuts , chocolate , caramel , candies , sweets and other flavors are sometimes added either inside or on top . A recent trend has been to create novel flavors of fudge , giving vibrant visual appeal at the same time . Fudge is often bought as a gift from a gift shop in tourist areas and attractions .",
  "/wiki/Butter": "Butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of milk or cream . It is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature , consisting of approximately 80% butterfat . It is used at room temperature as a spread , melted as a condiment , and used as an ingredient in baking , sauce making , pan frying , and other cooking procedures . Most frequently made from cow 's milk , butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals , including sheep , goats , buffalo , and yaks . It is made by churning milk or cream to separate the fat globules from the buttermilk . Salt and food colorings are sometimes added to butter . Rendering butter , removing the water and milk solids , produces clarified butter or ghee , which is almost entirely butterfat . Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream , where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers . Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated , but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature , and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 \u00b0C ( 90 to 95 \u00b0F ) . The density of butter is 911 grams per litre ( 0.950 lb per US pint ) . It generally has a pale yellow color , but varies from deep yellow to nearly white . Its natural , unmodified color is dependent on the source animal 's feed and genetics , but the commercial manufacturing process commonly manipulates the color with food colorings like annatto or carotene .",
  "/wiki/Fahrenheit": "The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit ( 1686-1736 ) . It uses the degree Fahrenheit ( symbol : \u00b0F ) as the unit . Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist . The lower defining point , 0 \u00b0F , was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice , water and a salt ( ammonium chloride ) . Further limits were established as the melting point of ice ( 32 \u00b0F ) and his best estimate of the average human body temperature ( 96 \u00b0F , about 2.6 \u00b0F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale ) . The scale is now usually defined by two fixed points : the temperature at which water freezes into ice is defined as 32 \u00b0F , and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 \u00b0F , a 180 \u00b0F separation , as defined at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure . At the end of the 2010s , Fahrenheit was used as the official temperature scale only in the United States ( including its unincorporated territories ) , its freely associated states in the Western Pacific ( Palau , the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands ) , the Cayman Islands , and Liberia . Antigua and Barbuda and other islands which use the same meteorological service , such as Saint Kitts and Nevis , the Bahamas , and Belize use Fahrenheit and Celsius . All other countries in the world officially now use the Celsius scale , named after Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius . A handful of British Overseas Territories still use Fahrenheit alongside Celsius including the British Virgin Islands , Montserrat , Anguilla , and Bermuda .",
  "/wiki/Celsius": "The Celsius scale , also known as the centigrade scale , is a temperature scale . As an SI derived unit , it is used worldwide . In the United States , the Bahamas , Belize , the Cayman Islands and Liberia , Fahrenheit remains the preferred scale for everyday temperature measurement . The degree Celsius ( symbol : \u00b0C ) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty . It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius ( 1701-1744 ) , who developed a similar temperature scale . Before being renamed to honor Anders Celsius in 1948 , the unit was called centigrade , from the Latin centum , which means 100 , and gradus , which means steps . From 1743 , the Celsius scale is based on 0 \u00b0C for the freezing point of water and 100 \u00b0C for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure . Prior to 1743 , the scale was also based on the boiling and melting points of water , but the values were reversed ( i.e . the boiling point was at 0 degrees and the melting point was at 100 degrees ) . The 1743 scale reversal was proposed by Jean-Pierre Christin . By international agreement , between 1954 and 2019 the unit degree Celsius and the Celsius scale were defined by absolute zero and the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water ( VSMOW ) , a precisely defined water standard . This definition also precisely related the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale , which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol K. Absolute zero , the lowest temperature possible , is defined as being exactly 0 K and \u2212273.15 \u00b0C .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa .

Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs , such as basil , mentha , rosemary , sage , savory , marjoram , oregano , hyssop , thyme , lavender , and perilla . Some species are shrubs , trees ( such as teak ) , or , rarely , vines . Many members of the family are widely cultivated , not only for their aromatic qualities , but also their ease of cultivation , since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings . [ citation needed ] Besides those grown for their edible leaves , some are grown for decorative foliage , such as Coleus . Others are grown for seed , such as Salvia hispanica ( chia ) , or for their edible tubers , such as Plectranthus edulis , Plectranthus esculentus , Plectranthus rotundifolius , and Stachys affinis ( Chinese artichoke ) . The family has a cosmopolitan distribution . The enlarged Lamiaceae contain about 236 genera and have been stated to contain 6,900 to 7,200 species , but the World Checklist lists 7,534 .

Medicine has been around for thousands of years , during most of which it was an art ( an area of skill and knowledge ) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture . For example , a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing , or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism . In recent centuries , since the advent of modern science , most medicine has become a combination of art and science ( both basic and applied , under the umbrella of medical science ) . While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice , the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science . Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine , though they do not fall within the modern definition of medicine which is based in medical science .

Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose , and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose ( table sugar ) . It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener . Most microorganisms do not grow in honey , so sealed honey does not spoil , even after thousands of years . One tablespoonful ( 15 ml ) of honey provides 46 calories ( kcal ) of energy . Honey is regarded as safe when not taken in excessive amounts . Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity .

Depending on size and type of fruit , this process of preservation can take from several days to several months . This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year . The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar , preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates . Fruits that are commonly candied include dates , cherries , pineapple , and a root , ginger . The principal candied peels are orange and citron ; these with candied lemon peel are the usual ingredients of mixed chopped peel ( which may also include glac\u00e9 cherries ) . Recipes vary from region to region , but the general principle is to boil the fruit , steep it in increasingly strong sugar solutions for a number of weeks , and then dry off any remaining water .",
  "/wiki/Panforte": "Panforte is a traditional chewy Italian dessert containing fruits and nuts . It is similar to a florentine but much thicker , or a little like a lebkuchen . Its origins date back to the crusaders who discovered it in Turkey . The soldiers used this staple on their long marches as it kept well due its excessive honey based content . Honey was abundant in Turkey and in the Middle East and formed part of Turkish delight and other desserts . There are references to the Crusaders carrying panforte , a durable confection , with them on their quests , and to the use of panforte in surviving sieges . They , in turn brought it back on their long voyage back home . In Italy 's Tuscany region , particularly Siena , today claims to have been the origin of this dessert . Given that honey was such a prized and scarce commodity from the Holy Land , documents from 1205 show that panforte was paid to the monks and nuns of a local monastery as a tax or tithe which was due on the seventh of February that year . Literally , panforte means strong bread which refers to the spicy flavour . Originally the Sienese called it panpepato ( peppered bread ) , due to the strong pepper used . Other Arab influences in Northern Italian cuisine include the Schiaccia briaca and Alchermes .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

  "/wiki/Icing_sugar": "Powdered sugar , also called confectioners ' sugar or icing sugar , is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state . It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow . Although most often produced in a factory , powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder , or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle . Powdered sugar is used in industrial food production when a quick-dissolving sugar is required . Home cooks use it principally to make icing or frosting and other cake decorations . It is often dusted onto baked goods to add a subtle sweetness and delicate decoration . Powdered sugar is available in varying degrees of fineness , most commonly XXX , XXXX , and 10X : the greater the number of Xs , the finer the particles . [ unreliable source ? ] Finer particles absorb more moisture , which results in caking . Corn starch , potato starch or tricalcium phosphate is added at 2 to 5% concentration to absorb moisture and to improve flow by reducing friction between sugar crystals . Because of these anticaking agents , it can not always be used as a substitute for granulated sugar .",
  "/wiki/Pudding": "Pudding is a type of food that can be either a dessert or a savory ( salty or spicy ) dish that is part of the main meal . [ note 1 ] The modern usage of the word pudding to denote primarily desserts has evolved over time from the originally almost exclusive use of the term to describe savory dishes , specifically those created using a process similar to that used for sausages , in which meat and other ingredients in mostly liquid form are encased and then steamed or boiled to set the contents . Black pudding , Yorkshire pudding , and haggis survive from this tradition . In the United Kingdom and some of the Commonwealth countries , the word pudding can be used to describe both sweet and savory dishes . Unless qualified , however , the term in everyday usage typically denotes a dessert ; in the United Kingdom , pudding is used as a synonym for a dessert course . Dessert puddings are rich , fairly homogeneous starch- or dairy-based desserts such as rice pudding , steamed cake mixtures such as treacle sponge pudding with or without the addition of ingredients such as dried fruits as in a Christmas pudding . Savory dishes include Yorkshire pudding , black pudding , suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding . In the United States and some parts of Canada , pudding characteristically denotes a sweet milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based custards , instant custards or a mousse , often commercially set using cornstarch , gelatin or similar collagen agent such as the Jell - O brand line of products . In Commonwealth countries these puddings are known as custards ( or curds ) if they are egg-thickened , as blancmange if starch-thickened , and as jelly if gelatin-based . Pudding may also refer to other dishes such as bread pudding and rice pudding , although typically these names derive from their origin as British dishes .",
