  "/wiki/Christmas": "Christmas ( or Feast of the Nativity ) is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ , observed primarily on December 25 [ a ] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world . A feast central to the Christian liturgical year , it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide , which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night ; in some traditions , Christmastide includes an octave . Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world 's nations , is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians , as well as culturally by many non-Christians , and forms an integral part of the holiday season centered around it . The traditional Christmas narrative , the Nativity of Jesus , delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem , in accordance with messianic prophecies . When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city , the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born , with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the information . Although the month and date of Jesus ' birth are unknown , the church in the early fourth century fixed the date as December 25 . This corresponds to the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar . Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar , which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world . However , part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar , which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar . For Christians , believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity , rather than knowing Jesus ' exact birth date , is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas . The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian , Christian , and secular themes and origins . Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving ; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath ; Christmas music and caroling ; viewing a Nativity play ; an exchange of Christmas cards ; church services ; a special meal ; and the display of various Christmas decorations , including Christmas trees , Christmas lights , nativity scenes , garlands , wreaths , mistletoe , and holly .",

  "/wiki/Sound_and_Vision": "Sound and Vision is a song and single by David Bowie which appeared on his 1977 album Low . The song is notable for juxtaposing an uplifting guitar and synthesizer-led instrumental track with Bowies withdrawn lyrics . In keeping with the minimalist approach of Low , Bowie and co-producer Tony Visconti originally recorded the track as an instrumental , bar the backing vocal ( performed by Viscontis wife , Mary Hopkin ) . Bowie then recorded his vocal after the rest of the band had left the studio , before trimming verses off the lyrics and leaving a relatively lengthy instrumental intro on the finished song . Selected as the first single from the album , Sound and Vision was used by the BBC on trailers at the time . This provided considerable exposure , much needed as Bowie opted to do nothing to promote the single himself , and helped the song to No . 3 . The song was also a top ten hit in Germany , Austria and the Netherlands . However , it stalled at No . 87 in Canada and only managed No . 69 in the United States , where it signaled the end of Bowie 's short commercial honeymoon until Let 's Dance in 1983 . The first live performance of the song was at Earls Court during the Isolar II Tour on 1 July 1978 .",
