It grew out of resistance to the military junta led by Siad Barre during the 1980s . By 1988-1990 , the Somali Armed Forces began engaging various armed rebel groups , including the Somali Salvation Democratic Front in the northeast , the Somali National Movement in the northwest , and the United Somali Congress in the south . The clan-based armed opposition groups eventually managed to overthrow the Barre government in 1991 . Various armed factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum and turmoil that followed , particularly in the south . In 1990-92 customary law temporarily collapsed due to the fighting . This precipitated the arrival of UNOSOM I UN military observers in July 1992 , followed by larger peacekeeping forces . Factional fighting continued in the south . In the absence of a central government , Somalia became a failed state . The UN withdrew in 1995 , having incurred significant casualties , but no central authority had yet been reestablished . After the collapse of the central government , there was some return to customary and religious law in most regions . In 1991 and 1998 , two autonomous regional governments were also established in the northern part of the country .",

Since the initial objectives were completed , a coalition of over 40 countries ( including all NATO members ) formed a security mission in the country . The war has since mostly involved US and allied Afghan government troops battling Taliban insurgents . The war in Afghanistan is the longest war in US history . Following the September 11 attacks in 2001 on the US , which President George W. Bush blamed on Osama bin Laden who was living or hiding in Afghanistan and had already been wanted since 1998 , President Bush demanded that the Taliban , who were de facto ruling the country , hand over bin Laden . The Taliban declined to extradite him unless they were provided clear evidence of his involvement in the attacks , which the US refused to provide and dismissed as a delaying tactic and then on 7 October 2001 launched Operation Enduring Freedom with the United Kingdom . To justify the War , the Bush administration claimed that Afghanistan only had selective sovereignty , and that intervention was necessary because the Taliban threatened the sovereignty of other states . The two were later joined by other forces , including the Northern Alliance - the Afghan opposition which had been fighting the Taliban in the ongoing civil war since 1996 . By December 2001 , the Taliban and their al-Qaeda allies were mostly defeated in the country , and at the Bonn Conference new Afghan interim authorities ( mostly from the Northern Alliance ) elected Hamid Karzai to head the Afghan Interim Administration . The United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) to assist the new authority with securing Kabul , which after a 2002 loya jirga ( grand assembly ) became the Afghan Transitional Administration .

The war is currently the second deadliest of the 21st century . The unrest in Syria , part of a wider wave of the 2011 Arab Spring protests , grew out of discontent with the Syrian government and escalated to an armed conflict after protests calling for Assad 's removal were violently suppressed . The war , which began on 15 March 2011 with major unrest in Damascus and Aleppo , is being fought by several factions : the Syrian Armed Forces and its international allies , a loose alliance of mostly Sunni opposition rebel groups ( including the Free Syrian Army ) , Salafi jihadist groups ( including al-Nusra Front ) , the mixed Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) , and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) , with a number of countries in the region and beyond being either directly involved or providing support to one or another faction ( Iran , Russia , Turkey , the United States , as well as others ) . Iran , Russia , and Hezbollah support the Syrian Arab Republic and the Syrian Armed Forces militarily , with Russia conducting airstrikes and other military operations since September 2015 . The U.S.-led international coalition , established in 2014 with the declared purpose of countering ISIL , has conducted airstrikes primarily against ISIL as well as some against government and pro-government targets . They have also deployed special forces and artillery units to engage ISIL on the ground . Since 2015 , the U.S. has supported the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria and its armed wing , the SDF , materially , financially , and logistically . Turkey has been directly involved in operations against the Syrian government since August 2016 , not only participating in airstrikes against ISIL alongside the U.S.-led coalition , but also actively supporting the Syrian opposition and occupying large swaths of northwestern Syria while engaging in significant ground combat with the SDF , ISIL , and the Syrian government . Between 2011 and 2017 , fighting from the Syrian Civil War spilled over into Lebanon as opponents and supporters of the Syrian government traveled to Lebanon to fight and attack each other on Lebanese soil , with ISIL and Al-Nusra also engaging the Lebanese Army . Furthermore , while officially neutral , Israel has exchanged fire with Hezbollah and Iranian forces , whose presence in southwestern Syria it views as a threat . It has also carried out repeated strikes in the rest of Syria since the start of the war , mainly targeting Syrian government forces and alleged Iranian and Hezbollah militants .",

  "/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen": "The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen , also called the Arab coalition ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a ) , is an intervention launched by Saudi Arabia in 2015 , leading a coalition of nine countries from West Asia and Africa , in response to calls from the internationally recognized pro-Saudi president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi for military support after he was ousted by the Houthi movement due to economic and political grievances , and fled to Saudi Arabia . Code-named Operation Decisive Storm ( Arabic : \u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0627\u0635\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0632\u0645 Amaliyyat '\u0100\u1e63ifat al-\u1e24azm ) , the intervention is said to be in compliance with Article 2 ( 4 ) of the UN Charter by the international community ; but this has been contested by some academics . The intervention initially consisted of a bombing campaign on Houthi rebels and later a naval blockade and the deployment of ground forces into Yemen . The Saudi-led coalition has attacked the positions of the Houthi militia , and loyalists of the former President of Yemen , Ali Abdullah Saleh , allegedly supported by Iran ( see Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflict ) . Fighter jets and ground forces from Egypt , Morocco , Jordan , Sudan , the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain , and Academi ( formerly Blackwater ) took part in the operation . Djibouti , Eritrea , and Somalia made their airspace , territorial waters , and military bases available to the coalition . The United States provided intelligence and logistical support , including aerial refueling and search-and-rescue for downed coalition pilots . It also accelerated the sale of weapons to coalition states and continued strikes against AQAP . The US and Britain have deployed their military personnel in the command and control centre responsible for Saudi-led air strikes on Yemen , having access to lists of targets . The war has received widespread criticism and had a dramatic worsening effect on Yemen 's humanitarian situation , that reached the level of a humanitarian disaster or humanitarian catastrophe , and some have labelled it as a genocide . In 2019 , the conflict 's status was described as a military stalemate for years ."
