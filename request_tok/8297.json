  "/wiki/Beach_volleyball": "Beach volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of two players on a sand court divided by a net . As in indoor volleyball , the objective of the game is to send the ball over the net and to ground it on the opponent 's side of the court , and to prevent the same effort by the opponent . Each team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net , and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively except after making a block touch ( the block touch counting as one touch , leaving only two more touches before the ball must be hit over ) . The ball is put in play with a serve - a hit by the server from behind the rear court boundary over the net to the opponents . The rally continues until the ball is grounded on the playing court , goes out , or a fault is made in the attempt to return the ball . The team that wins the rally scores a point and serves to start the following rally . The four players serve in the same sequence throughout the match , changing server each time a rally is won by the receiving team . Beach volleyball most likely originated in 1915 on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii , while the modern two-player game originated in Santa Monica , California . It has been an Olympic sport since the 1996 Summer Olympics . The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball ( FIVB ) is the international governing body for the sport , and organizes the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships and the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour .",
