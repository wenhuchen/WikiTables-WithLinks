This was the first World Series of MLB 's divisional era . The Mets became the first expansion team to win a division title , a pennant , and the World Series , winning in their eighth year of existence , becoming the fastest expansion team to win a World Series up to that point . Two teams eventually surpassed the latter record , as the Florida Marlins won the 1997 World Series in their fifth year ( also becoming the first wild card team to win a World Series ) and the Arizona Diamondbacks won the 2001 World Series in their fourth year of play . The 1969 World Series was the first World Series since 1954 to have games played in New York that did not involve the New York Yankees ; it was also the first World Series in which neither the New York Giants nor Brooklyn Dodgers ( as both teams had moved to California in 1958 ) represented New York from the NL ; all subsequent World Series with a New York-area NL team participating have involved the Mets , who have been the only NL baseball team located in New York City since that era .",
