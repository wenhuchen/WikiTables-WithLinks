  "/wiki/Sacramento_River": "The Sacramento River ( Spanish : R\u00edo Sacramento ) is the principal river of Northern California in the United States , and is the largest river in California . Rising in the Klamath Mountains , the river flows south for 400 miles ( 640 km ) before reaching the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and San Francisco Bay . The river drains about 26,500 square miles ( 69,000 km2 ) in 19 California counties , mostly within the fertile agricultural region bounded by the Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada known as the Sacramento Valley , but also extending as far as the volcanic plateaus of Northeastern California . Historically , its watershed has reached as far north as south-central Oregon where the now , primarily , endorheic ( closed ) Goose Lake rarely experiences southerly outflow into the Pit River , the most northerly tributary of the Sacramento . The Sacramento and its wide natural floodplain were once abundant in fish and other aquatic creatures , notably one of the southernmost large runs of chinook salmon in North America . For about 12,000 years , humans have depended on the vast natural resources of the watershed , which had one of the densest Native American populations in California . The river has provided a route for trade and travel since ancient times . Hundreds of tribes sharing regional customs and traditions inhabited the Sacramento Valley , first coming into contact with European explorers in the late 1700s . The Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga named the river Rio de los Sacramentos in 1808 , later shortened and anglicized into Sacramento . In the 19th century , gold was discovered on a tributary of the Sacramento River , starting the California Gold Rush and an enormous population influx to the state . Overland trails such as the California Trail and Siskiyou Trail guided hundreds of thousands of people to the gold fields . By the late part of the century mining had ceased to be a major part of the economy , and many immigrants turned to farming and ranching .",
  "/wiki/Shasta_Dam": "Shasta Dam ( called Kennett Dam before its construction ) is a concrete arch-gravity dam across the Sacramento River in Northern California in the United States . At 602 feet ( 183 m ) high , it is the eighth-tallest dam in the United States . Located at the north end of the Sacramento Valley , Shasta Dam creates Shasta Lake for long-term water storage , flood control , hydroelectricity and protection against the intrusion of saline water . The largest reservoir in the state , Shasta Lake can hold about 4,500,000 acre feet ( 5,600 GL ) . Envisioned as early as 1919 as an effort to conserve , control , store , and distribute water to the Central Valley , California 's main agricultural region , Shasta was first authorized in the 1930s as a state undertaking . However , bonds did not sell due to the onset of the Great Depression and Shasta was transferred to the federal Bureau of Reclamation as a public works project . Construction started in earnest in 1937 under the supervision of Chief Engineer Frank Crowe . During its building , the dam provided thousands of much-needed jobs ; it was finished twenty-six months ahead of schedule in 1945 . When completed , the dam was the second-tallest in the United States after Hoover , and was considered one of the greatest engineering feats of all time . Even before its dedication , Shasta Dam served an important role in World War II providing electricity to California factories , and still plays a vital part in the management of state water resources today . However , it has greatly changed the environment and ecology of the Sacramento River , and flooded sacred Native American tribal lands . In recent years , there has been debate over whether or not to raise the dam in order to allow for increased water storage and power generation , a proposal opposed by tribes and environmental experts because of negative impacts from water diversions from river flows needed by endangered fish including salmon species .",

The dam impounds Lake Oroville , the second largest man-made lake in the state of California , capable of storing more than 3.5 million acre feet ( 1.1 trillion US gallons ; 4.3 trillion litres ) . Built by the California Department of Water Resources ( DWR ) , Oroville Dam is one of the key features of the California State Water Project ( SWP ) , one of two major projects passed that set up California 's statewide water system . Construction was initiated in 1961 , and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction , including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site , the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968 . The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant , then the country 's largest underground power station . Since its completion in 1968 , the Oroville Dam has allocated the flow of the Feather River from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the State Water Project 's California Aqueduct , which provides a major supply of water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley as well as municipal and industrial water supplies to coastal Southern California , and has prevented large amounts of flood damage to the area - more than $ 1.3 billion between the years of 1987 and 1999 . The dam has confined fish migration up the Feather River and the controlled flow of the river as a result of the Oroville Dam has affected riparian habitat . Multiple attempts at trying to counter the dam 's impacts on fish migration have included the construction of a salmon/steelhead fish incubator on the river , which began shortly after the dam was completed . In February 2017 , the main and emergency spillways threatened to fail , leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people living near the dam . After deterioration of the main spillway largely stabilized and the water level of the dam 's reservoir dropped below the top of the emergency spillway , the evacuation order was lifted .",

  "/wiki/Trinity_River_(California)": "The Trinity River ( originally called the Hoopa or Hupa by the Yurok , and hun ' by the Natinixwe/Hupa people ) is a major river in northwestern California in the United States , and is the principal tributary of the Klamath River . The Trinity flows for 165 miles ( 266 km ) through the Klamath Mountains and Coast Ranges , with a watershed area of nearly 3,000 square miles ( 7,800 km2 ) in Trinity and Humboldt Counties . Designated a National Wild and Scenic River , along most of its course the Trinity flows swiftly through tight canyons and mountain meadows . The river is known for its once prolific runs of anadromous fish , notably Chinook salmon and steelhead , which sustained Native American tribes for thousands of years . Due to its remoteness , the Trinity did not feature prominently in the early European colonization of California , but the gold rush in the mid-1800s brought thousands of gold seekers to the area . The river was named by Major Pierson B . Reading who , upon reaching the river in 1848 , mistakenly believed it to flow into the Pacific Ocean at Trinidad Bay . During and after the gold rush , the influx of settlers and miners into the Trinity River country led to conflict with indigenous tribes , many of which saw severe depopulation due to fighting and foreign diseases . In the following decades logging and ranching , combined with mining runoff , significantly changed the river 's ecology and led to the decline of its fish populations . Today , the Trinity River is an important water source for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation , as well as a major center of recreational activities such as gold panning , fishing and whitewater rafting . Since 1964 the Trinity River has been dammed to create Trinity Lake , the third largest man-made lake in the state .

  "/wiki/Stanislaus_River": "The Stanislaus River is a tributary of the San Joaquin River in north-central California in the United States . The main stem of the river is 96 miles ( 154 km ) long , and measured to its furthest headwaters it is about 150 miles ( 240 km ) long . Originating as three forks in the high Sierra Nevada , the river flows generally southwest through the agricultural San Joaquin Valley to join the San Joaquin south of Manteca , draining parts of five California counties . The Stanislaus is known for its swift rapids and scenic canyons in the upper reaches , and is heavily used for irrigation , hydroelectricity and domestic water supply . Originally inhabited by the Miwok group of Native Americans , the Stanislaus River was explored in the early 1800s by the Spanish , who conscripted indigenous people to work in the colonial mission and presidio systems . The river is named for Estanislao , who led a native uprising in Mexican-controlled California in 1828 , but was ultimately defeated on the Stanislaus River ( then known as the R\u00edo de los Laquisimes ) . During the California Gold Rush , the Stanislaus River was the destination of tens of thousands of gold seekers ; many of them reached California via Sonora Pass , at the headwaters of the Middle Fork . Many miners and their families eventually settled along the lower Stanislaus River . The farms and ranches they established are now part of the richest agricultural region in the United States . Early mining companies were formed to channel Stanislaus River water to the gold diggings via elaborate canal and flume systems , which directly preceded the irrigation districts formed by farmers who sought a greater degree of river control . Starting in the early 1900s , many dams were built to store and divert water ; these were often paired with hydro-power systems , whose revenues covered the high cost of the water projects . In the 1970s the construction of the federal New Melones Dam incited major opposition from recreation and environmental groups ( documented on the Stanislaus River Archive ) , who protested the loss of one of the last free-flowing stretches of the Stanislaus .",

The dam serves mainly for irrigation water supply , and also provides hydropower generation , flood control , and recreation benefits . The dam was authorized in 1944 as a unit of the federal Central Valley Project , a system designed to provide irrigation water to the fertile agricultural region of the Central Valley . It would be built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( Corps ) , and transferred to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation ( Reclamation ) upon completion . In 1966 , work began to clear the foundations for a high dam that would replace an earlier , much smaller structure built by two irrigation districts . Construction of the main embankment began in 1976 , and was topped out in late 1978 . The filling of New Melones Lake commenced in 1978 , and the dam 's hydroelectric station produced its first power in mid-1979 . New Melones was the focus of a long environmental battle during the 1970s and early 1980s ; critics protested the flooding of a long scenic stretch of the Stanislaus River , which flowed over whitewater rapids through the deepest limestone canyon in the western United States . The protestors employed a variety of methods , some extreme , to prevent the filling of New Melones Lake until 1983 , when record-setting floods filled the reservoir and nearly breached the dam 's emergency spillway . The fight over New Melones galvanized the river conservation movement in California and influenced major water policy changes on the state and federal levels ; since its completion , no other dams of its size or importance have been built in the United States . The New Melones project has continued to generate controversy , due to the water yield from the project being lower than expected , and the use of New Melones water to meet federal environmental standards at the expense of farming .",

Originating at over 8,000 feet ( 2,400 m ) above sea level in Yosemite National Park , the Tuolumne drains a rugged watershed of 1,958 square miles ( 5,070 km2 ) , carving a series of canyons through the western slope of the Sierra . While the upper Tuolumne is a fast-flowing mountain stream , the lower river crosses a broad , fertile and extensively cultivated alluvial plain . Like most other central California rivers , the Tuolumne is dammed multiple times for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectricity . Humans have inhabited the Tuolumne River area for up to 10,000 years . Prior to the arrival of Europeans , the river canyon provided an important summer hunting ground and a trade route between Native Americans in the Central Valley to the west and the Great Basin to the east . First named in 1806 by a Spanish explorer after a nearby indigenous village , the Tuolumne was heavily prospected during the California Gold Rush in the 1850s , and the lower valley was cultivated by American settlers over the next few decades . The city of Modesto grew up on the Tuolumne as a railroad hub , absorbing most of the population of the Tuolumne valley around the turn of the century . As agricultural production rose , farmers along the Tuolumne formed California 's first two irrigation districts to better control and develop the river . From the 1900s to the 1930s , the river was dammed at Don Pedro and Hetch Hetchy to provide water for Central Valley farmers and the city of San Francisco , respectively . The Hetch Hetchy project , located inside Yosemite National Park , incited national controversy , and has been described as having forged the modern environmental movement in the United States .

It is most well known for its swift and steep course through the southern part of Yosemite National Park , where it is the primary watercourse flowing through Yosemite Valley . The river 's character changes dramatically once it reaches the plains of the agricultural San Joaquin Valley , where it becomes a slow-moving meandering stream . The river first formed as the Sierra Nevada rose about 10 million years ago , and sediment eroded from its canyon helped form the flat floor of the San Joaquin Valley . Glaciation during the ice ages carved the high elevation parts of the watershed , including Yosemite Valley , into their present shape . Historically , there was an extensive riparian zone which provided habitat for millions of migrating birds , and the river had one of the southernmost runs of chinook salmon in North America . Miwok and Paiute people lived along the river for thousands of years before Spanish and Mexican military expeditions passed through in the early 19th century . The California Gold Rush brought many people into California and some settled in towns along the lower Merced River . A railroad was built along the Merced canyon , enabling mining and logging in the upper watershed , and later carrying tourists to Yosemite National Park . Conflicts between settlers and indigenous peoples resulted in wars , including the expulsion of the Ahwahnechee from Yosemite . Large-scale irrigation was introduced to the San Joaquin Valley in the late 19th century , and led to the construction of numerous state , federal and privately owned dams , which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat . Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth .",

  "/wiki/Kings_River_(California)": "The Kings River is a 132.9-mile ( 213.9 km ) river draining the Sierra Nevada mountain range in central California in the United States . Its headwaters originate along the Sierra Crest in and around Kings Canyon National Park and form the eponymous Kings Canyon , one of the deepest river gorges in North America . The river is impounded in Pine Flat Lake before flowing into the San Joaquin Valley ( the southern half of the Central Valley ) southeast of Fresno . With its upper and middle course in Fresno County , the Kings River diverges into multiple branches in Kings County , with some water flowing south to the old Tulare Lake bed and the rest flowing north to the San Joaquin River . However , most of the water is consumed for irrigation well upstream of either point . Inhabited for thousands of years by the Yokuts and other native groups , the Kings River basin once fed a vast network of seasonal wetlands around Tulare Lake that supported millions of waterfowl , fish , and game animals , in turn providing sustenance for indigenous peoples . Tulare Lake was once the largest freshwater lake in the western U.S. , at the middle of an endorheic basin also fed by the Kaweah , Tule and Kern Rivers . The river was named by Gabriel Moraga , the commander of a Spanish military expedition in 1806 , but it was not until California became a U.S. state in 1850 that many Europeans arrived and settled along the Kings River , driving out the area 's original inhabitants . Logging and livestock grazing inflicted significant environmental damage on the upper parts of the river system , before the federal government moved to establish national parks and preserves there . The Kings has a long history of water development , going back to the mid-19th century when farmers made their first attempts to irrigate with Kings River water . In the early 1900s Tulare Lake and its surrounding wetlands were diked , drained and reclaimed for agriculture ; the construction of Pine Flat Dam in the 1950s tamed the river 's seasonal floods . The battle for control over Kings River water produced extended conflicts , including a set of dams proposed in what would become Kings Canyon National Park .",

The dam 's primary purpose is flood control , with irrigation , hydroelectric power generation and recreation secondary in importance . The dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) after a six-year controversy between supporters of irrigation development and proponents of flood control . Construction began in 1947 and was completed in 1954 . Since then , the dam has prevented millions of dollars in flood damages and fostered extensive development of agriculture on the fertile floodplain of the Kings River ; after 1984 it has also generated hydroelectricity .

  "/wiki/Colorado_River": "The Colorado River is one of the principal rivers ( along with the Rio Grande ) in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico . The 1,450-mile-long ( 2,330 km ) river drains an expansive , arid watershed that encompasses parts of seven U.S. states and two Mexican states . Starting in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado , the river flows generally southwest across the Colorado Plateau and through the Grand Canyon before reaching Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border , where it turns south toward the international border . After entering Mexico , the Colorado approaches the mostly dry Colorado River Delta at the tip of the Gulf of California between Baja California and Sonora . Known for its dramatic canyons , whitewater rapids , and eleven U.S. National Parks , the Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people . The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts , which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and domestic water supply . Its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power , and its major dams regulate peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West . Intensive water consumption has dried up the lower 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the river , which has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s . Beginning with small bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers , Native Americans have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years . Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago , the watershed was home to large agricultural civilizations - considered some of the most sophisticated indigenous North American cultures - which eventually declined due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices . Most native peoples that inhabit the region today are descended from other groups that settled there beginning about 1,000 years ago . Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16th century , when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area , which became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821 .",

  "/wiki/Kern_River": "The Kern River , originally Rio de San Felipe , later La Porciuncula , is a river in the U.S. state of California , approximately 165 miles ( 270 km ) long . It drains an area of the southern Sierra Nevada mountains northeast of Bakersfield . Fed by snowmelt near Mount Whitney , the river passes through scenic canyons in the mountains and is a popular destination for whitewater rafting and kayaking . It is the southernmost major river system in the Sierra Nevada , and is the only major river in the Sierra that drains in a southerly direction . The Kern River formerly emptied into the now dry Buena Vista Lake and Kern Lake via the Kern River Slough , and Kern Lake in turn emptied into Buena Vista Lake via the Connecting Slough at the southern end of the Central Valley . Buena Vista Lake , when overflowing , first backed up into Kern Lake and then upon rising higher drained into Tulare Lake via Buena Vista Slough and a changing series of sloughs of the Kern River . The lakes were part of a partially endorheic basin that sometimes overflowed into the San Joaquin River . This basin also included the Kaweah and Tule Rivers , as well as southern distributaries of the Kings that all flowed into Tulare Lake . Since the late 19th century the Kern has been almost entirely diverted for irrigation , recharging aquifers and the California Aqueduct , although some water empties into Lake Webb and Lake Evans , two small lakes in a portion of the former Buena Vista Lakebed . The lakes were created in 1973 for recreational use . The lakes hold 6,800 acre\u22c5ft ( 8,400 dam3 ) combined . Crops are grown in the rest of the former lakebed .",

The 366-mile ( 589 km ) long river starts in the high Sierra Nevada , and flows through the rich agricultural region of the northern San Joaquin Valley before reaching Suisun Bay , San Francisco Bay , and the Pacific Ocean . An important source of irrigation water as well as a wildlife corridor , the San Joaquin is among the most heavily dammed and diverted of California 's rivers . People have inhabited the San Joaquin Valley for more than 8,000 years , and it was long one of the major population centers of pre-Columbian California . Starting in the late 18th century , successive waves of explorers then settlers , mainly Spanish and American , emigrated to the San Joaquin basin , first exploiting then driving out the indigenous tribes . The newcomers quickly appropriated the rich natural and hydrologic resources of the watershed for use in farms and cities , but found themselves plagued by flood and drought . Because of the uniform topography of the San Joaquin Valley , floods once transformed much of the lower river into a huge inland sea . In the 20th century , many levees and dams were built on the San Joaquin and all of its major tributaries . These engineering works changed the fluctuating nature of the river forever , and cut off the Tulare Basin from the rest of the San Joaquin watershed . Once habitat for hundreds of thousands of spawning salmon and millions of migratory birds , today the river is subject to tremendous water-supply , navigation and regulation works by various federal agencies , which have dramatically reduced the flow of the river since the 20th century .",
