Many athletes , among them some who won events , did n't know that they had competed in the Olympic Games . Women took part in the games for the first time , and sailor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Pourtal\u00e8s , born Helen Barbey in New York City , became the first female Olympic champion . The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes , who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest . At the Sorbonne conference of 1894 , Pierre de Coubertin proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in 1900 in Paris . The delegates to the conference were unwilling to wait six years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896 . A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and that Paris would host the second celebration .
