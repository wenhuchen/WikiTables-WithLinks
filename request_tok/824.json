  "/wiki/Juventus_F.C.": "Juventus Football Club ( from Latin : iuvent\u016bs , youth ; Italian pronunciation : [ ju\u02c8v\u025bntus ] ) , colloquially known as Juve ( pronounced [ \u02c8ju\u02d0ve ] ) , is an Italian professional association football club based in Turin , Piedmont . Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students , the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city , the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium . Nicknamed Vecchia Signora ( the Old Lady ) , the club has won 35 official league titles , 13 Coppa Italia titles and eight Supercoppa Italiana titles , being the record holder for all these competitions ; two Intercontinental Cups , two European Cups / UEFA Champions Leagues , one European Cup Winners ' Cup , a joint national record of three UEFA Cups , two UEFA Super Cups and a joint national record of one UEFA Intertoto Cup . Consequently , the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio ( FIGC ) ranking [ a ] whilst on the international stage occupies the 5th position in Europe and the eleventh in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies , having led the UEFA ranking during seven seasons since its inception in 1979 , the most for an Italian team and joint second overall . Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus , initially as an athletics club , it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa 's football section ( 1893 ) and has competed uninterruptedly in the top flight league ( reformulated as Serie A from 1929 ) since its debut in 1900 after changing its name to Foot-Ball Club Juventus , with the exception of the 2006-07 season , being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923 . [ b ] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club ante litteram in the country , having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s and becoming one of the first ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value , revenue and profit since the mid-1990s , being listed on the Borsa italiana since 2001 . Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles , and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the 1976-77 UEFA Cup ( first Southern European side to do so ) , the 1983-84 Cup Winners ' Cup and the 1984-85 European Champions ' Cup . With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup , it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies ; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi , becoming in addition the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association . In December 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics ( IFFHS ) , the highest for an Italian club in both . The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and one of the largest worldwide . Unlike most European sporting supporters ' groups , which are often concentrated around their own club 's city of origin , it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora , making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo ( anti-parochialism ) and italianit\u00e0 ( Italianness ) . Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards , four of these in consecutive years ( 1982-1985 , an overall record ) , among these the first player representing Serie A , Omar S\u00edvori , as well as Michel Platini and three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi ; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards , with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zin\u00e9dine Zidane , a national record and third and joint second highest overall , respectively , in the cited prizes .",

Novese is the only Italian football team that won a championship without playing a single season in Serie A nor in Serie B .",
  "/wiki/1921\u201322_Prima_Categoria_(FIGC)": "The 1921-22 Prima Categoria season was won by Novese . During the Summer of 1921 , a dispute between the Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio ( FIGC ) and the larger teams within the league arose . The teams asked for a reduction of the number of participants in the 1a Divisione . Vittorio Pozzo developed a plan to accommodate the teams ' requests , however , after a vote the plan was not passed ; the smaller clubs feared that they would disappear if such a reduction was introduced . This led to the creation of a new Italian football federation , the CCI ( Confederazione Calcistica Italiana ) , that organized a championship concurrent to the FIGC championship . This separation , however , only lasted one season and the following summer FIGC accepted a reduction in the league participants . The 1921-22 FIGC winner was U.S. Novese .",
  "/wiki/Hellas_Verona_F.C.": "Hellas Verona Football Club , commonly referred to as Hellas Verona or simply Verona , is an Italian football club based in Verona , Veneto , that currently plays in Serie A . The team won the Serie A Championship in 1984-85 .",
  "/wiki/1984\u201385_Serie_A": "The 1984-85 Serie A season heralded Hellas Verona 's first and so far only Scudetto . Unusually , none of the big three of Juventus , Milan or Internazionale managed to finish in the top two . Ascoli , Lazio and Cremonese all got relegated to Serie B . It was the only season when referees were assigned to matches by way of a random draw instead of being assigned to a specific match by a special commission of referees ( 'designatori arbitrali ' ) . After the betting scandal of the early 1980s ( the 'calcioscommesse ' scandal ) it had been decided to clean up the image of Italian football by assigning referees randomly instead of picking them , in order to clear up all the suspicions and accusations .",
  "/wiki/U.C._Sampdoria": "Unione Calcio Sampdoria , commonly referred to as Sampdoria ( Italian pronunciation : [ samp\u02c8d\u0254\u02d0rja ] ) , is an Italian professional football club based in Genoa , Liguria . The club was formed in 1946 from the merger of two existing sports clubs whose roots can be traced back to the 1890s , Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria . Both the team name and jersey reflect this , the first being a combination of the former names , the second incorporating the former teams ' colours ( blue-white and white-red-black ) in a single design . The team 's colours are blue with white , red and black hoops , hence the nickname blucerchiati ( blue-circled ) . Sampdoria play at Stadio Luigi Ferraris , capacity 36,536 , which it shares with Genoa 's other club , Genoa Cricket and Football Club . The derby between the two teams is commonly known as the Derby della Lanterna . Sampdoria have won the Scudetto once in their history , in 1991 . The club has also won the Coppa Italia four times , in 1985 , 1988 , 1989 and 1994 , and the Supercoppa Italiana once , in 1991 . Their biggest European success came when they won the Cup Winners ' Cup in 1990 . They also reached the European Cup final in 1992 , losing the final 1-0 to Barcelona after extra time .",
  "/wiki/1990\u201391_Serie_A": "The 1990-91 season saw Sampdoria win the Serie A title for the first time in their history , finishing five points ahead of second placed Milan . Third placed Internazionale were victorious in the UEFA Cup , with ninth-placed Roma compensating for their sub-standard league season with glory in the Coppa Italia , while Juventus 's seventh-placed finish meant that they would be without European action for the first season in three decades . Lecce , Pisa , Cesena and Bologna were all relegated . A notable record was set on 9 December 1990 in a Serie A fixture , when Bologna player Giuseppe Lorenzo was sent off after just 10 seconds for striking an opponent in the match against Parma . This was reportedly the fastest sending off in senior football worldwide at the time ."
