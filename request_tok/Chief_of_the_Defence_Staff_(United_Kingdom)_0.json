  "/wiki/Marshal_of_the_Royal_Air_Force": "Marshal of the Royal Air Force ( MRAF ) is the highest rank in the British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . In peacetime it was granted to RAF officers in the appointment of Chief of the Defence Staff ( CDS ) , and to retired Chiefs of the Air Staff ( CAS ) , who were promoted to it on their last day of service . While surviving marshals of the RAF retain the rank for life , the highest rank to which officers on active service are promoted is now air chief marshal . Although general promotions to Marshal of the Royal Air Force have been discontinued since the British defence cuts of the 1990s , further promotions to the rank may still be made in wartime , for members of the Royal Family and certain very senior RAF air officers in peacetime at the discretion of the monarch ; all such promotions in peacetime are only honorary , however . In 2012 , Charles , Prince of Wales was promoted to the rank while in 2014 Lord Stirrup , who had served as Chief of the Air Staff and Chief of the Defence Staff for over seven years , was also promoted . Marshal of the Royal Air Force is a five-star rank and unlike the air marshal ranks , can properly be considered a marshal rank . MRAF has a NATO ranking code of OF-10 , equivalent to an admiral of the fleet in the Royal Navy or a field marshal in the British Army . The rank was instituted in 1919 and the first officer to be promoted to MRAF was Sir Hugh Trenchard in 1927 . Since that time , including Trenchard , there have been 27 men who have held the rank . Of those , 22 have been professional RAF officers and five have been senior members of the British Royal Family . King George V did not formally hold the rank of marshal of the RAF ; rather he assumed the title of Chief of the Royal Air Force . In this capacity from time to time he wore RAF uniform with the rank insignia of a marshal of the RAF .",

Since its formation , the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history . In particular , it played a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign , the Battle of Britain . The RAF 's mission is to support the objectives of the British Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , which are to provide the capabilities needed to ensure the security and defence of the United Kingdom and overseas territories , including against terrorism ; to support the Government 's foreign policy objectives particularly in promoting international peace and security . The RAF describes its mission statement as .

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",
  "/wiki/Field_marshal_(United_Kingdom)": "Field Marshal has been the highest rank in the British Army since 1736 . A five-star rank with NATO code OF-10 , it is equivalent to an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . A Field Marshal 's insignia consists of two crossed batons surrounded by yellow leaves below St Edward 's Crown . Like Marshals of the RAF and Admirals of the Fleet , Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life , though on half-pay when not in an appointment . The rank has been used sporadically throughout its history and was vacant during parts of the 18th and 19th centuries ( when all former holders of the rank were deceased ) . After the Second World War , it became standard practice to appoint the Chief of the Imperial General Staff ( later renamed Chief of the General Staff ) to the rank on his last day in the post . Army officers occupying the post of Chief of the Defence Staff , the professional head of all the British Armed Forces , were usually promoted to the rank upon their appointment . In total , 141 men have held the rank of field marshal . The majority led careers in the British Army or the British Indian Army , rising through the ranks to eventually become a field marshal . Some members of the British Royal Family - most recently Prince Edward , Duke of Kent , and Charles , Prince of Wales - were promoted to the rank after shorter periods of service . Three British monarchs - George V , Edward VIII , and George VI - assumed the rank on their accessions to the throne , while Edward VII was already a field marshal , and two British consorts - Albert , Prince Consort and Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh - were appointed by their respective queens . Other ceremonial appointments were made as diplomatic gestures .",

  "/wiki/British_Army": "The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom , a part of British Armed Forces . As of 2019 [ update ] , the British Army comprises just over 79,300 trained regular ( full-time ) personnel and just over 27,200 trained reserve ( part-time ) personnel . The modern British Army traces back to 1707 , with an antecedent in the English Army that was created during the Restoration in 1660 . The term British Army was adopted in 1707 after the Acts of Union between England and Scotland . Members of the British Army swear allegiance to the monarch as their commander-in-chief , but the Bill of Rights of 1689 requires parliamentary consent for the Crown to maintain a peacetime standing army . Therefore , Parliament approves the army by passing an Armed Forces Act at least once every five years . The army is administered by the Ministry of Defence and commanded by the Chief of the General Staff . The British Army has seen action in major wars between the world 's great powers , including the Seven Years ' War , the Napoleonic Wars , the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars . Britain 's victories in these decisive wars allowed it to influence world events and establish itself as one of the world 's leading military and economic powers . Since the end of the Cold War , the British Army has been deployed to a number of conflict zones , often as part of an expeditionary force , a coalition force or part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation .",
