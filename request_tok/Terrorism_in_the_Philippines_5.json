Al-Qaeda operates as a network of Islamic extremists and Salafist jihadists . The organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , the European Union , the United States , the United Kingdom , Russia , India , and various other countries ( see below ) . Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries , including the 1998 United States embassy bombings , the September 11 attacks , and the 2002 Bali bombings . The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror , which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies . The deaths of key leaders , including that of Osama bin Laden , have led al-Qaeda 's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks , to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and lone-wolf operators . Al-Qaeda characteristically employs attacks which include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of several targets . Activities which are ascribed to al-Qaeda involve the actions of those who have made a pledge of loyalty to bin Laden , or to the actions of al-Qaeda-linked individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq or Sudan . Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the removal of all foreign influences in Muslim countries . Al-Qaeda members believe that a Christian-Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam . As Salafist jihadists , members of al-Qaeda believe that the killing of non-combatants is religiously sanctioned . This belief ignores the aspects of religious scripture which forbid the murder of non-combatants and internecine fighting .",

  "/wiki/Grenade": "A grenade is an explosive weapon typically thrown by hand , but can also refer to projectiles shot out of grenade launchers . Generally , a grenade consists of an explosive charge , a detonating mechanism , and firing pin inside the grenade to trigger the detonating mechanism . Once the soldier throws the grenade , the safety lever releases , the striker throws the safety lever away from the grenade body as it rotates to detonate the primer . The primer explodes and ignites the fuze ( sometimes called the delay element ) . The fuze burns down to the detonator , which explodes the main charge . There are several types of grenades like the fragmentation ( frag ) , high explosive ( HE ) concussion and smoke grenades . Fragmentation grenades are probably the most common in modern armies . They are missiles designed to disperse shrapnel on detonation . The body is generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel , which will provide limited fragmentation through sharding and splintering , though in modern grenades a pre-formed fragmentation matrix inside the grenade is commonly used . The pre-formed fragmentation may be spherical , cuboid , wire or notched wire . Most anti-personnel ( AP ) grenades are designed to detonate either after a time delay or on impact . When the word grenade is used colloquially , it is generally assumed to refer to a fragmentation grenade .",
