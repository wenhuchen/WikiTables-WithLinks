Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",
  "/wiki/Indian_cuisine": "Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent . Given the range of diversity in soil type , climate , culture , ethnic groups , and occupations , these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use locally available spices , herbs , vegetables , and fruits . Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion , in particular Hinduism , cultural choices and traditions . The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule , particularly the Mughal rule . Samosas and pilafs can be regarded as examples . Historical events such as foreign invasions , trade relations , and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country . The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India . A number of these such as the potato , tomatoes , chillies , peanuts , and Guava have become staples in many regions of India . Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations ; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe 's Age of Discovery . Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia . Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world , especially those from Europe ( especially Britain ) , the Middle East , Southern African , East Africa , Southeast Asia , North America , Mauritius , Fiji , Oceania , and the Caribbean .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy .

  "/wiki/Vikings": "Vikings [ a ] were Scandinavians , who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries , raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe , and explored westwards to Iceland , Greenland , and Vinland . The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age , 793-1066 AD . This period of Nordic military , mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia , Estonia , the British Isles , France , Kievan Rus ' and Sicily . Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills , and characterised by the longship , Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral , North Africa , and the Middle East . Following extended phases of ( primarily sea- or river-borne ) exploration , expansion and settlement , Viking ( Norse ) communities and governments were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe , Belarus , Ukraine and European Russia , the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America . This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture , while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself , with profound developmental implications in both directions . Popular , modern conceptions of the Vikings - the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia - often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources . A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century ; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival . Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent , piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century . Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clich\u00e9s and stereotypes , complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy . These representations are not always accurate - for example , there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets , a costuming element that first appeared in Wagnerian opera .",

Two extant types of water buffalo are recognized , based on morphological and behavioural criteria - the river buffalo of the Indian subcontinent and further west to the Balkans , Egypt , and Italy , and the swamp buffalo , found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east . The origins of the water buffalo types are debated , although results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the swamp-type may have originated in China and was domesticated about 4,000 years ago , while the river-type may have originated in India and was domesticated about 5,000 years ago . After the domestication of the water buffalo in Southeast Asia , the swamp buffalo dispersed up to the Yangtze River valley between 3,000 and 7,000 years ago . Water buffaloes were traded from the Indus Valley Civilisation to Mesopotamia , in modern Iraq , 2500 BC by the Meluhhas . The seal of a scribe employed by an Akkadian king shows the sacrifice of water buffaloes . At least 130 million water buffaloes exist , and more people depend on them than on any other domestic animal .

It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and North Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",
  "/wiki/Bacteria": "Bacteria ( /b\u00e6k\u02c8t\u026a\u0259ri\u0259/ ( listen ) ; common noun bacteria , singular bacterium ) are a type of biological cell . They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms . Typically a few micrometres in length , bacteria have a number of shapes , ranging from spheres to rods and spirals . Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth , and are present in most of its habitats . Bacteria inhabit soil , water , acidic hot springs , radioactive waste , and the deep biosphere of the earth 's crust . Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals . Most bacteria have not been characterised , and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory . The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology , a branch of microbiology . Virtually all animal life on earth is dependent on bacteria for their survival as only bacteria and some archea possess the genes and enzymes necessary to synthesize vitamin B12 , also known as cobalamin , and provide it through the food chain . Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body . It is a cofactor in DNA synthesis , and in both fatty acid and amino acid metabolism . It is particularly important in the normal functioning of the nervous system via its role in the synthesis of myelin .",
  "/wiki/Fermentation_(food)": "Fermentation in food processing is the process of converting carbohydrates to alcohol or organic acids using microorganisms - yeasts or bacteria - under anaerobic conditions . Fermentation usually implies that the action of microorganisms is desired . The science of fermentation is known as zymology or zymurgy . The term fermentation sometimes refers specifically to the chemical conversion of sugars into ethanol , producing alcoholic drinks such as wine , beer , and cider . However , similar processes take place in the leavening of bread ( CO2 produced by yeast activity ) , and in the preservation of sour foods with the production of lactic acid , such as in sauerkraut and yogurt . Other widely consumed fermented foods include vinegar , olives , and cheese . More localised foods prepared by fermentation may also be based on beans , grain , vegetables , fruit , honey , dairy products , fish .",
  "/wiki/Milk": "Milk is a nutrient-rich , white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals . It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals ( including humans who are breastfed ) before they are able to digest other types of food . Early-lactation milk contains colostrum , which carries the mother 's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases . It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose . Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon , particularly among humans , many of whom consume the milk of other mammals . As an agricultural product , milk , also called dairy milk , is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy . Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 , from 260 million dairy cows . India is the world 's largest producer of milk , and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder , yet it exports few other milk products . The ever-increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future . New Zealand , Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products . China and Russia were the world 's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient , contributing to a worldwide glut of milk . Throughout the world , more than six billion people consume milk and milk products .",
  "/wiki/Lactobacillus_bulgaricus": "Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp . bulgaricus ( until 2014 known as Lactobacillus bulgaricus ) is one of over 200 published species in the Lactobacillus genome complex ( LGC ) and is the main bacterium used for the production of yogurt . It also plays a crucial role in the ripening of some cheeses , as well as in other processes involving naturally fermented products . It is defined as homofermentive lactic acid bacteria due to the way it feeds on the milk sugar lactose to produce lactic acid , which helps preserve milk . It is also considered a probiotic . It is a gram-positive rod that may appear long and filamentous . It is non-motile and does not form spores . It is also non-pathogenic . It is regarded as aciduric or acidophilic , since it requires a low pH ( around 5.4-4.6 ) to grow effectively . In addition , it is anaerobic . As it grows on raw dairy products , it creates and maintains the acidic environment that it needs to thrive via its production of lactic acid . In addition , it grows optimally at temperatures of 40-44 \u00b0C under anaerobic conditions .",
  "/wiki/Streptococcus_thermophilus": "Streptococcus thermophilus also known as Streptococcus salivarius subsp . thermophilus is a gram-positive bacterium , and a fermentative facultative anaerobe , of the viridans group . It tests negative for cytochrome , oxidase , and catalase , and positive for alpha-hemolytic activity . It is non-motile and does not form endospores . S. thermophilus is fimbriated . It is also classified as a lactic acid bacterium . S. thermophilus is found in fermented milk products , and is generally used in the production of yogurt , alongside Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp . bulgaricus . The two species are synergistic , and S. thermophilus probably provides L. d. bulgaricus with folic acid and formic acid which it uses for purine synthesis . S. thermophilus has an optimal growth temperature range of 35 - 42 \u00b0C while L. d. bulgaricus has an optimal range of 43 - 46 \u00b0C .",
  "/wiki/Butter": "Butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of milk or cream . It is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature , consisting of approximately 80% butterfat . It is used at room temperature as a spread , melted as a condiment , and used as an ingredient in baking , sauce making , pan frying , and other cooking procedures . Most frequently made from cow 's milk , butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals , including sheep , goats , buffalo , and yaks . It is made by churning milk or cream to separate the fat globules from the buttermilk . Salt and food colorings are sometimes added to butter . Rendering butter , removing the water and milk solids , produces clarified butter or ghee , which is almost entirely butterfat . Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream , where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers . Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated , but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature , and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 \u00b0C ( 90 to 95 \u00b0F ) . The density of butter is 911 grams per litre ( 0.950 lb per US pint ) . It generally has a pale yellow color , but varies from deep yellow to nearly white . Its natural , unmodified color is dependent on the source animal 's feed and genetics , but the commercial manufacturing process commonly manipulates the color with food colorings like annatto or carotene .",
  "/wiki/Churning_(butter)": "Churning is the process of shaking up cream or whole milk to make butter , usually using a butter churn . In Europe from the Middle Ages until the Industrial Revolution , a churn was usually as simple as a barrel with a plunger in it , moved by hand . These have mostly been replaced by mechanical churns . Butter is essentially the fat of milk . It is usually made from sweet cream . In the USA , Ireland , the UK and the Nordic countries , salt is usually added to it . Unsalted ( sweet ) butters are most commonly used in the rest of Europe . However , it can also be made from acidulated or bacteriologically soured cream . Well into the 19th century butter was still made from cream that had been allowed to stand and sour naturally . The cream was then skimmed from the top of the milk and poured into a wooden tub . Buttermaking was done by hand in butter churns . The natural souring process is , however , a very sensitive one and infection by foreign microorganisms often spoiled the result .",
  "/wiki/Cream": "Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization . In un-homogenized milk , the fat , which is less dense , eventually rises to the top . In the industrial production of cream , this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called separators . In many countries , it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content . It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets , and contains high levels of saturated fat . Cream skimmed from milk may be called sweet cream to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey , a by-product of cheese-making . Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty , tangy and cheesy . In many countries , cream is usually sold partially fermented : sour cream , cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche , and so on . Both forms have many culinary uses in sweet , bitter , salty and tangy dishes . Cream produced by cattle ( particularly Jersey cattle ) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat ; this gives it a slightly yellow tone , hence the name of the yellowish-white color : cream . This is also the origin of butter 's yellow color . Cream from goat 's milk , or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets , is white .",
  "/wiki/Spread_(food)": "A spread is a food that is spread , generally with a knife , onto foods such as bread and crackers . Spreads are added to food to enhance the flavor or texture of the food , which may be considered bland without it . Butter and soft cheeses are typical spreads . A sandwich spread is a spreadable condiment used in a sandwich , in addition to more solid ingredients . Butter , mayonnaise , prepared mustard , and ketchup are typical sandwich spreads , along with their variants such as Thousand Island dressing , Tartar sauce , and Russian dressing . Spreads are different from dips , such as salsa , which are generally not applied to spread onto food , but have food dipped into them , instead . Common spreads include dairy spreads ( such as cheeses , creams , and butters , although the term butter is broadly applied to many spreads ) , margarines , honey , plant-derived spreads ( such as jams , jellies , and hummus ) , yeast spreads ( such as vegemite and marmite ) , and meat-based spreads ( such as p\u00e2t\u00e9 ) .",
  "/wiki/Condiment": "A condiment is a spice , sauce , or preparation ( such as onions ) that is added to food , typically after cooking , to impart a specific flavor , to enhance the flavor , or to complement the dish . A table condiment or table sauce is more specifically a condiment that is served separately from the food and is added to taste by the diner . Condiments are sometimes added prior to serving , for example , in a sandwich made with ketchup , mustard or mayonnaise . Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavor or texture : barbecue sauce , compound butter , teriyaki sauce , soy sauce , and marmite and sour cream are examples . Many condiments , such as mustard or ketchup , are available in single-serving packets , commonly when supplied with take-out or fast-food meals .",
  "/wiki/Cooking": "Cooking or cookery is the art , technology , science and craft of preparing food for consumption . Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world , from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves , to baking in various types of ovens , reflecting unique environmental , economic , and cultural traditions and trends . Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of cooks . Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments . Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat , such as in ceviche , a traditional South American dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice . Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans . It may have started around 2 million years ago , though archaeological evidence for it reaches no more than 1 million years ago . The expansion of agriculture , commerce , trade , and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients . New inventions and technologies , such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling water , expanded cooking techniques . Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served .",
  "/wiki/Frying": "Frying is the cooking of food in oil or another fat .

  "/wiki/Butterfat": "Butterfat or milkfat is the fatty portion of milk . Milk and cream are often sold according to the amount of butterfat they contain .",
  "/wiki/Protein": "Proteins are large biomolecules , or macromolecules , consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues . Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms , including catalysing metabolic reactions , DNA replication , responding to stimuli , providing structure to cells , and organisms , and transporting molecules from one location to another . Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids , which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes , and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity . A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide . A protein contains at least one long polypeptide . Short polypeptides , containing less than 20-30 residues , are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides , or sometimes oligopeptides . The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues . The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene , which is encoded in the genetic code . In general , the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids ; however , in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and - in certain archaea - pyrrolysine . Shortly after or even during synthesis , the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification , which alters the physical and chemical properties , folding , stability , activity , and ultimately , the function of the proteins . Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached , which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors . Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function , and they often associate to form stable protein complexes .",
  "/wiki/Hard_sauce": "Hard sauce is a sweet , rich dessert sauce made by creaming or beating butter and sugar with rum ( rum butter ) , brandy ( brandy butter ) , whiskey , sherry ( sherry butter ) , vanilla or other flavourings . It is served cold , often with hot desserts . It is typically served with plum pudding , bread pudding , Indian pudding , hasty pudding , and other heavy puddings as well as with fruitcakes and gingerbread . In the U.K. brandy butter and rum butter are particularly associated with the Christmas and New Year season and Christmas pudding and warm mince pies , serving as a seasonal alternative to cream , ice cream or custard . At Cambridge , it is also known as Senior Wrangler sauce . Rum butter specifically is typically found in Cumbria and is not common in other regions of the U.K. ; while Brandy butter is found nationwide and is a more commonplace Christmas accompaniment . Though it is called a sauce , it is neither a liquid nor smooth . It could be more accurately classified as a spread and has the consistency of butter . It is easy to make and keeps for months under refrigeration . It can be pressed into a decorative mold before chilling . Under European Community regulations , to be called rum/brandy/sherry butter , it must contain at least 20% butterfat .",
  "/wiki/Fat": "Fats are one of the three main macronutrients , along with carbohydrates and proteins . Fat molecules consist of primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms and are therefore hydrophobic and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water . Examples include cholesterol , phospholipids , and triglycerides . The terms lipid , oil , and fat are often confused . Lipid is the general term , though a lipid is not necessarily a triglyceride . Oil normally refers to a lipid with short or unsaturated fatty acid chains that is liquid at room temperature , while fat ( in the strict sense ) specifically refers to lipids that are solids at room temperature - however , fat ( in the broad sense ) may be used in food science as a synonym for lipid . Fat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life , and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions . They are a necessary part of the diet of most heterotrophs ( including humans ) and are the most energy dense , thus the most efficient form of energy storage . Some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they can not be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents . There are two essential fatty acids ( EFAs ) in human nutrition : alpha-linolenic acid ( an omega-3 fatty acid ) and linoleic acid ( an omega-6 fatty acid ) . Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats . Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called lipases produced in the pancreas .",

  "/wiki/Buttermilk": "Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink . Traditionally , it was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream ; most modern buttermilk is cultured , however . It is common in warm climates ( including the Balkans , South Asia , the Middle East and the Southern United States ) where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly . Buttermilk can be drunk straight , and it can also be used in cooking . In making soda bread , the acid in buttermilk reacts with the raising agent , sodium bicarbonate , to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent . Buttermilk is also used in marination , especially of chicken and pork , which the lactic acid helps to tenderize , retain moisture and allows added flavors to permeate the meat .",

Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted , forming a broth . Soups are similar to stews , and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two ; however , soups generally have more liquid ( broth ) than stews . In traditional French cuisine , soups are classified into two main groups : clear soups and thick soups . The established French classifications of clear soups are bouillon and consomm\u00e9 . Thick soups are classified depending upon the type of thickening agent used : pur\u00e9es are vegetable soups thickened with starch ; bisques are made from pur\u00e9ed shellfish or vegetables thickened with cream ; cream soups may be thickened with b\u00e9chamel sauce ; and velout\u00e9s are thickened with eggs , butter , and cream .

  "/wiki/Emulsion": "An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible ( unmixable or unblendable ) . Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of matter called colloids . Although the terms colloid and emulsion are sometimes used interchangeably , emulsion should be used when both phases , dispersed and continuous , are liquids . In an emulsion , one liquid ( the dispersed phase ) is dispersed in the other ( the continuous phase ) . Examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes , homogenized milk , and some cutting fluids for metal working . The word emulsion comes from the Latin emulgere to milk out , from ex out + mulgere to milk , as milk is an emulsion of fat and water , along with other components . Two liquids can form different types of emulsions . As an example , oil and water can form , first , an oil-in-water emulsion , wherein the oil is the dispersed phase , and water is the continuous phase . ( Lipoproteins , used by all complex living organisms , are one example of this . ) Second , they can form a water-in-oil emulsion , wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the continuous phase . Multiple emulsions are also possible , including a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion and an oil-in-water-in-oil emulsion . Emulsions , being liquids , do not exhibit a static internal structure .",
  "/wiki/Caramelization": "Caramelization or caramelisation is the browning of sugar , a process used extensively in cooking for the resulting sweet nutty flavor and brown colour . The brown colours are produced by three groups of polymers : caramelans ( C24H36O18 ) , caramelens ( C36H50O25 ) , and caramelins ( C125H188O80 ) . As the process occurs , volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released , producing the characteristic caramel flavor . Like the Maillard reaction , caramelization is a type of non-enzymatic browning . Unlike the Maillard reaction , caramelization is pyrolytic , as opposed to being a reaction with amino acids . When caramelization involves the disaccharide sucrose , it is broken down into the monosaccharides fructose and glucose ."
