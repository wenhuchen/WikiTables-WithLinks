It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",

It constitutes both a county and a municipality . During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken , the northernmost Danish province . Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the name \u00c1nslo , and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada . The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300 . Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence . After being destroyed by a fire in 1624 , during the reign of King Christian IV , a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king 's honour . It was established as a municipality ( formannskapsdistrikt ) on 1 January 1838 . The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814-1905 union between Sweden and Norway . From 1877 , the city 's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage , a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897 . In 1925 the city , after incorporating the village retaining its former name , was renamed Oslo . In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker , a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger , thus creating the modern , vastly enlarged Oslo municipality .",

By road , Odense is located 45 kilometres ( 28 mi ) north of Svendborg , 144 kilometres ( 89 mi ) to the south of Aarhus and 167 kilometres ( 104 mi ) to the southwest of Copenhagen . The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970 , and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007 , when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark . Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales . He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there . There has been human settlement in the Odense area for over 4,000 years , although the name was not mentioned in writing until 988 , and by 1070 , it had already grown into a thriving city . Canute IV of Denmark , generally considered to be the last Viking king , was murdered by unruly peasants in Odense 's St Alban 's Priory on 10 July 1086 . Although the city was burned in 1249 following a royal rivalry , it quickly recovered and flourished as a centre of commerce in the Middle Ages . After a period of decline , large-scale plans for development were made during the 18th century , which led to the rebuilding of Odense Palace and the building of a canal to the Port of Odense , facilitating trade . In 1865 , one of the largest railway terminals in Denmark was built , further increasing the population and commerce , and by 1900 , Odense had reached a population of 35,000 . Odense 's Odinst\u00e5rnet was one of the tallest towers in Europe when built in 1935 but was destroyed by the Nazis during World War II .",

It lies on the river Labe 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) east of Prague on the D11 highway . It obtained the status of town from the king of Bohemia in 1472 . A historic milestone in the life of the town was the year 1905 , when it was visited by the German estate owner Prince von B\u00fclow . This well-known water diviner found in the inner courtyard of the castle signs of a strong spring , which was later bored to a depth of 97.6 metres ( 320 ft ) . The discovery of carbonic mineral water resulted in the opening of the first spa in 1908 . After World War I Pod\u011bbrady rapidly changed into a spa town which from 1926 specialized in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases , rapidly gaining renown not only in the Czech Republic , but also abroad in countries including Austria , Germany , Russia and the United States . The history of Pod\u011bbrady reaches back to medieval times . A long-distance trade route running from Prague to eastern Bohemia and then on to Silesia and Poland passed through the then-forested landscape interwoven with a dense network of river branches . This important communication intersected the River Labe to the west of the present town , at a place called Na Vinici . An ancient community and a small fortress originated near the ford . It is most likely that the position of this community is reflected in the present name of the town : Pod\u011bbrady - pode brody = below the ford .",

  "/wiki/West_Germany": "West Germany was the informal name for the Federal Republic of Germany , a country in Western Europe , in the period between its formation on 23 May 1949 and German reunification on 3 October 1990 . During this Cold War period , the western portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc . The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate . Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1952 , and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 .",

In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes ."
