The railway station is an important stop on the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh . The city is also 70 miles ( 110 km ) east of Birmingham , 38 miles ( 61 km ) east of Leicester , 81 miles ( 130 km ) south of Kingston upon Hull and 65 miles ( 105 km ) west of Norwich . The local topography is flat , and in some places the land lies below sea level , for example in parts of the Fens to the east of Peterborough . Human settlement in the area began before the Bronze Age , as can be seen at the Flag Fen archaeological site to the east of the current city centre , also with evidence of Roman occupation . The Anglo-Saxon period saw the establishment of a monastery , Medeshamstede , which later became Peterborough Cathedral . The population grew rapidly after the railways arrived in the 19th century , and Peterborough became an industrial centre , particularly known for its brick manufacture . After the Second World War , growth was limited until designation as a New Town in the 1960s . Housing and population are expanding and a \u00a31 billion regeneration of the city centre and immediately surrounding area is under way . Industrial employment has fallen since then , a significant proportion of new jobs being in financial services and distribution .",
  "/wiki/September_11_attacks": "The September 11 attacks ( also referred to as 9/11 ) [ a ] were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda against the United States on the morning of Tuesday , September 11 , 2001 . The attacks resulted in 2,977 victim fatalities , over 25,000 injuries , and caused at least $ 10 billion in infrastructure and property damage . Additional people have died of 9/11-related cancer and respiratory diseases in the months and years following the attacks . Four passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers ( United Airlines and American Airlines ) - all of which departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for San Francisco and Los Angeles - were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists . Two of the planes , American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers , respectively , of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan . Within an hour and 42 minutes , both 110-story towers collapsed . Debris and the resulting fires caused a partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex , including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower , as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures . A third plane , American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon ( the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense ) in Arlington County , Virginia , which led to a partial collapse of the building 's west side . The fourth plane , United Airlines Flight 93 , was initially flown toward Washington , D.C. , but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , after its passengers thwarted the hijackers . 9/11 is the single deadliest terrorist attack in human history and the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States , with 343 and 72 killed , respectively . Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda . The United States responded by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban , which had failed to comply with U.S. demands to extradite Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan .",

Bacup received a charter of incorporation in 1882 , giving it municipal borough status and its own elected town government , consisting of a mayor , aldermen and councillors to oversee local affairs . In the late 20th century , Bacup became part of the borough of Rossendale .

  "/wiki/Sawed-off_shotgun": "A sawed-off shotgun also called a sawn-off shotgun and a short-barreled shotgun , is a type of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel - typically under 18 inches - and often a shortened or absent stock . Despite the colloquial term , barrels do not , strictly speaking , have to be shortened with a saw . Barrels can be manufactured at shorter lengths as an alternative to traditional , longer barrels . This makes them easier to transport due to their smaller profile and lighter weight . The design also makes the weapon easy to maneuver in cramped spaces , a feature sought by military close quarters combat units , law enforcement SWAT team users , and home defense purposes . As a result of the shorter barrel length , any sawed-off shotgun with a magazine tube will have its capacity reduced . In the 1930s , the United States , Britain and Canada mandated that a permit be required to own these firearms . They are subject to legal restrictions depending upon jurisdiction . They are used by military forces and police agencies worldwide .",

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland , Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland . In 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30% of the island 's total population and about 3% of the UK 's population . Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal . Northern Ireland was created in 1921 , when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 . Unlike Southern Ireland , which would become the Irish Free State in 1922 , the majority of Northern Ireland 's population were unionists , who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom . Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned . For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland , David Trimble , called a cold house for Catholics .",
  "/wiki/LGBT": "LGBT ( also acronymed as LGBTQ ( + ) or GLBT ) is an initialism that stands for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender . In use since the 1990s , the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB , which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s . Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred . The initialism has become adopted into the mainstream as an umbrella term for use when labeling topics pertaining to sexuality and gender identity . For example , the LGBT Movement Advancement Project termed community centres , which have services specific to those members of the LGBT community , as LGBT community centers , in a comprehensive studies of such centres around the United States . The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures . It may be used to refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender , instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender . To recognize this inclusion , a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity ; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996 . Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI . The two acronyms are sometimes combined to form the terms LGBTIQ or LGBT+ to encompass spectrums of sexuality and gender . Other , less common variants also exist , motivated by a desire for inclusivity , including those over twice as long which have prompted criticism .",
