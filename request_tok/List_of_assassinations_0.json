  "/wiki/Hiempsal_I": "Hiempsal I ( died c. 117 BC ) , son of Micipsa and grandson of Masinissa , was a king of Numidia in the late 2nd century BC . Micipsa , on his deathbed , left his two sons , Adherbal and Hiempsal , together with his cousin , Jugurtha , joint heirs of his kingdom . Sallust claims the arrangement fell apart almost immediately due to the unprincipled ambition of Jugurtha and the longtime jealousy of his two half-brothers . At the very first meeting of the three princes their animosity displayed broke into the open . Hiempsal , the younger and most impetuous of the two brothers , gave mortal offence to Jugurtha . After this interview , it being agreed to divide the kingdom of Numidia , as well as the treasures of the late king , between the three princes , they took up their quarters in different towns in the neighborhood of Cirta . But as Hiempsal had imprudently established himself at Thirmida , in a house belonging to a dependant of Jugurtha , the latter took advantage of this circumstance to introduce a body of armed men into the house during the night , who put to death the unhappy prince , together with many of his followers . Livy , on the other hand , appears , so far as we can judge from the words of his Epitomist , to represent the death of Hiempsal as the result of open hostilities . Orosius , who probably followed Livy , says only Hiempsalem occidit .",
  "/wiki/Numidia": "Numidia ( 202 BC - 40 BC , Berber : Inumiden ) was the ancient kingdom of the Numidians located in what is now Algeria and a smaller part of Tunisia and small part of Libya in the Maghreb . The polity was originally divided between Massylii in the east and Masaesyli in the west . During the Second Punic War ( 218-201 BC ) , Masinissa , king of the Massylii , defeated Syphax of the Masaesyli to unify Numidia into one kingdom . The kingdom began as a sovereign state and later alternated between being a Roman province and a Roman client state . Numidia , at its largest extent , was bordered by the Kingdom of Mauretania to the west , at the Mulucha river , Africa Proconsularis ( now part of Tunisia ) to the east , the Mediterranean Sea to the north , and the Sahara to the south . It is considered to be one of the first major states in the history of Algeria and the Berber world .",
  "/wiki/Jugurtha": "Jugurtha or Jugurthen ( c. 160 - 104 BC ) was a king of Numidia , born in Cirta ( modern-day Constantine ) . When the Numidian king Micipsa , who had adopted Jugurtha , died in 118 BC , Jugurtha and his two adoptive brothers , Hiempsal and Adherbal , succeeded him . Jugurtha arranged to have Hiempsal killed and , after a civil war , defeated and killed Adherbal in 112 BC . The death of Adherbal , which was against the wishes of Rome , along with the growing popular anger in Rome at Jugurthas success in bribing Roman senators ( and thus avoiding Roman retribution for his crimes ) , led to the Jugurthine War between Rome and Numidia which , after a number of battles in Numidia between Roman and Numidian forces , eventually led to Jugurthas capture in 106 BC and his being paraded through Rome as part of Gaius Marius ' Roman triumph . He was then thrown into the Tullianum prison where he died of starvation in 104 BC . He was survived by his son , Oxyntas .",

Evacuated from Paris to Vichy in the unoccupied Free Zone ( zone libre ) in the southern part of metropolitan France which included French Algeria , it remained responsible for the civil administration of France as well as the French colonial empire . From 1940 to 1942 , while the Vichy regime was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine , the Germans and Italians militarily occupied northern and south-eastern France . While Paris remained the de jure capital of France , the government chose to relocate to the town of Vichy , 360 km ( 220 mi ) to the south in the zone libre , which thus became the de facto capital of the French State . Following the Allied landings in French North Africa in November 1942 , southern France was also militarily occupied by Germany and Italy to protect the Mediterranean coastline . Petain 's government remained in Vichy as the nominal government of France , albeit one that collaborated with Nazi Germany from November 1942 onwards . The government at Vichy remained there until late 1944 , when it lost its de facto authority due to the Allied invasion of France and the government was compelled to relocate to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany , where it continued to exist on paper until the end of hostilities in Europe . After being appointed Premier by President Albert Lebrun , Marshal P\u00e9tain 's cabinet agreed to end the war and signed an Armistice with Germany on 22 June 1940 . On 10 July , the Third Republic was effectively dissolved as P\u00e9tain was granted full powers by the National Assembly . At Vichy , P\u00e9tain established an authoritarian government that reversed many liberal policies and began tight supervision of the economy , calling for National Regeneration , with central planning a key feature . Labour unions came under tight government control . Conservative Catholics became prominent and clerical input in schools resumed .",

He is one of the six founding members of the Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale ( FLN ; National Liberation Front ) that launched an armed revolt throughout Algeria and issued a proclamation calling for a sovereign Algerian state . Ben M'hidi initially commanded Wilaya V ( the military district in the Oran region ) and played an important role at the FLN 's Soummam conference in August 1956 . He headed FLN operations during the Battle of Algiers where he was the last member of the FLN 's Comit\u00e9 de Coordination et d'Ex\u00e9cution ( CCE ; Committee of Coordination and Implementation ) . Ben M'hidi was a strong believer in that the revolution should be directed by internal rather than external revolutionaries . He was captured by French paratroopers in February 1957 . His death was announced in March 1957 by Pierre Gorlin , Robert Lacoste 's press officer . The events surrounding his death were disputed , and contended by many that he was in fact tortured before being summarily executed . Many who knew him , have ruled out the possibility of him taking his own life , as was reported in the media , due to his devotion to Islam , which forbids suicide . In 2000 , General Aussaresses admitted that Ben M'hidi was executed whilst in his custody , however , the exact truth regarding his death remains a mystery to this day . Ben M'hidi is considered to be a national hero in Algeria , and is considered to be a symbol of the revolution that brought an end to French colonialism .",

  "/wiki/Pied-noir": "The Pieds-Noirs ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ pjenwa\u0281 ] , Black-Feet , singular Pied-Noir ) are the people of French and other European origin who were born in Algeria during the period of French rule from 1830 to 1962 , and who returned to mainland France as soon as Algeria gained independence , or in the months following . Depending on context , the definition can also include the Algerian Jews , who had been granted French nationality by the Cremieux decree . From the French invasion on 18 June 1830 until its independence , Algeria was administratively part of France , and its European population were simply called Algerians or colons ( colonists ) , whereas the Muslim people of Algeria were called Arabs , Muslims or Indigenous . The term pied-noir began to be commonly used shortly before the end of the Algerian War in 1962 . As of the last census in French-ruled Algeria , taken on 1 June 1960 , there were 1,050,000 non-Muslim civilians ( mostly Catholic , but including 130,000 Algerian Jews ) in Algeria , 10 per cent of the population . During the Algerian War , the Pieds-Noirs overwhelmingly supported colonial French rule in Algeria and were opposed to Algerian nationalist groups such as the Front de lib\u00e9ration nationale ( English : National Liberation Front ) ( FLN ) and Mouvement national alg\u00e9rien ( English : Algerian National Movement ) ( MNA ) . The roots of the conflict reside in political and economic inequalities perceived as an alienation from the French rule as well as a demand for a leading position for the Berber , Arab , and Islamic cultures and rules existing before the French conquest . The conflict contributed to the fall of the French Fourth Republic and the mass exodus of Algerian Europeans and Jews to France . After Algeria became independent in 1962 , about 800,000 Pieds-Noirs of French nationality were evacuated to mainland France , while about 200,000 remained in Algeria . Of the latter , there were still about 100,000 in 1965 and about 50,000 by the end of the 1960s . Those who moved to France suffered ostracism from the Left for their perceived exploitation of native Muslims , and some blamed them for the war , thus the political turmoil surrounding the collapse of the French Fourth Republic . In popular culture , the community is often represented as feeling removed from French culture while longing for Algeria .",
