  "/wiki/Cooper_River_(South_Carolina)": "The Cooper River is a mainly tidal river in the U.S. state of South Carolina . The South Carolina cities of Mt . Pleasant , Charleston , North Charleston , Goose Creek , Moncks Corner , and Hanahan are located along the river . Short and wide , it is joined first by the blackwater East Branch , then farther downstream , the tidal Wando River . Almost immediately thereafter , the river widens into its estuary , uniting with the Ashley River to form the Charleston Harbor . Long used as an important commercial waterway , the West Branch of the Cooper River was initially connected to the Santee River near its navigation head by a canal built in the late 18th century . Though the West Branch still rises as a blackwater swamp in central Berkeley County , its main headwaters have been seamlessly shifted to Lake Moultrie by the 1940s vintage Tail Race Canal . Lake Moultrie is , in turn , fed from Lake Marion by a diversion canal built around the same time period . This artificial rerouting of the Cooper River basin has essentially unified the Santee and Cooper River systems into a single hydrological drainage entity . The river was named for Anthony Ashley Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury and chief Lord Proprietor of the Carolina Colony . Charleston was founded on the western bank of the Ashley River in 1670 ( at Charles Towne Landing ) , before moving across to its current peninsular location ten years later . Motorists have been able to cross the Cooper River under their own power for approximately eight decades , when it was first spanned by the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge .",
