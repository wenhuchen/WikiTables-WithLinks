  "intro": "San Jose Earthquakes are an American soccer club founded in 1994 as the San Jose Clash after the city of San Jose was awarded an inaugural Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise. San Jose began playing competitive soccer in the 1996 season. It plays its home games at Avaya Stadium, competing in the Western Conference of the MLS. The current San Jose Earthquakes is the second soccer team from San Jose to bear the Earthquakes nickname. The tradition was started by San Jose's North American Soccer League team in 1974 who carried the name until the team folded in 1988. The current San Jose Earthquakes is an entity distinct of this club, and hosted the first ever MLS game on April 6, 1996, against D.C. United. In 2005, the then owner of the Earthquakes, Anschutz Entertainment Group, announced plans of the team relocating to Houston due to failing efforts to secure a soccer-specific stadium in San Jose. The organization in Houston would be considered an expansion team by the league, eventually being known as the Houston Dynamo, who began play in 2006. The Earthquakes returned after a two-year hiatus, resuming play in 2008. As of January 18, 2017[update], a total of 210 players have participated in at least one league match for the San Jose Earthquakes. Chris Wondolowski is the club's all-time top scorer with 117 goals, and Ronald Cerritos has the club record in assists with 47. A total of 106 Earthquakes players have represented their country at full international level."
