  "/wiki/Investment_management": "Investment management ( or financial management ) is the professional asset management of various securities ( shares , bonds , and other securities ) and other assets ( e.g. , real estate ) in order to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of the investors . Investors may be institutions ( insurance companies , pension funds , corporations , charities , educational establishments etc . ) or private investors ( both directly via investment contracts and more commonly via collective investment schemes e.g . mutual funds or exchange-traded funds ) . The term 'asset management ' is often used to refer to the investment management of investment funds , while the more generic term 'fund management ' may refer to all forms of institutional investment as well as investment management for private investors . Investment managers who specialize in advisory or discretionary management on behalf of ( normally wealthy ) private investors may often refer to their services as money management or portfolio management often within the context of private banking . The term fund manager , or investment adviser in the United States , refers to both a firm that provides investment management services and an individual who directs fund management decisions . According to a Boston Consulting Group study , the assets managed professionally for fees reached an all-time high of US $ 62.4 trillion in 2012 , after remaining flat-lined since 2007 . Furthermore , these industry assets under management were expected to reach US $ 70.2 trillion at the end of 2013 as per a Cerulli Associates estimate . The global investment management industry is highly concentrated in nature , in a universe of about 70,000 funds roughly 99.7% of the US fund flows in 2012 went into just 185 funds . Additionally , a majority of fund managers report that more than 50% of their inflows go to only three funds . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Chicken": "The chicken ( Gallus gallus domesticus ) is a type of domesticated fowl , a subspecies of the red junglefowl ( Gallus gallus ) . They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals , with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011 . There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl . Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food ( consuming both their meat and eggs ) and , less commonly , as pets . Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies , chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period ( 4th-2nd centuries BC ) . Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia , Southeast Asia , and East Asia , but with the clade found in the Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent . From ancient India , the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor , and to Greece by the 5th century BC . Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC , with the bird that gives birth every day having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar , Babylonia , according to the annals of Thutmose III .",
  "/wiki/Frozen_food": "Freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten . Since early times , farmers , fishermen , and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season . Freezing food slows down decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice , inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species . In the food commodity industry , there are two processes : mechanical and cryogenic ( or flash freezing ) . The freezing kinetics is important to preserve the food quality and texture . Quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure . Cryogenic freezing is the quickest freezing technology available due to the ultra low liquid nitrogen temperature \u2212196 \u00b0C ( \u2212320 \u00b0F ) . Preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household freezers . Accepted advice to householders was to freeze food on the day of purchase . An initiative by a supermarket group in 2012 ( backed by the UK 's Waste & Resources Action Programme ) promotes the freezing of food as soon as possible up to the product 's 'use by ' date . The Food Standards Agency was reported as supporting the change , provided the food had been stored correctly up to that time .",

  "/wiki/Road_construction": "A road is a thoroughfare , route , or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance , including a motor vehicle , cart , bicycle , or horse . Roads consist of one or two roadways ( British English : carriageways ) , each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks ( British English : pavement ) and road verges . There is sometimes a bike path . Other names for roads include parkways , avenues , freeways , tollways , interstates , highways , or primary , secondary , and tertiary local roads .",
  "/wiki/Infrastructure": "Infrastructure is the fundamental facilities and systems serving a country , city , or other area , including the services and facilities necessary for its economy to function . Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical improvements such as roads , railways , bridges , tunnels , water supply , sewers , electrical grids , and telecommunications ( including Internet connectivity and broadband speeds ) . In general , it has also been defined as the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable , sustain , or enhance societal living conditions .",
  "/wiki/Holding_company": "A holding company is a company that owns other companies ' outstanding stock . A holding company usually does not produce goods or services itself ( with no eponymous consumer-facing brand at most times ) ; rather , its purpose is to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group . However , in many jurisdiction of the world , holding companies are usually termed as parent companies who besides holding stock in other companies can conduct trade and other business activities itself . Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies . Holding companies are also created to hold assets such as IP and trade secrets that are protected from the operation company . This creates a smaller risk when it comes to litigation . In the United States , 80% of stock , in voting and value , must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed . That is , if Company A owns 80% or more of the stock of Company B , Company A will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders , as the payment of dividends from B to A is essentially transferring cash from one company to the other . Any other shareholders of Company B will pay the usual taxes on dividends , as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these shareholders . Sometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding Holding or Holdings to its name .",
  "/wiki/Food": "Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism . Food is usually of plant or animal origin , and contains essential nutrients , such as carbohydrates , fats , proteins , vitamins , or minerals . The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism 's cells to provide energy , maintain life , or stimulate growth . Historically , humans secured food through two methods : hunting and gathering and agriculture , which gave modern humans a mainly omnivorous diet . Worldwide , humanity has created numerous cuisines and culinary arts , including a wide array of ingredients , herbs , spices , techniques , and dishes . Today , the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry . Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection , World Resources Institute , World Food Programme , Food and Agriculture Organization , and International Food Information Council . They address issues such as sustainability , biological diversity , climate change , nutritional economics , population growth , water supply , and access to food . The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) , recognizing the right to an adequate standard of living , including adequate food , as well as the fundamental right to be free from hunger .",
  "/wiki/Healthcare": "Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery , or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people . Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields . Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals . Dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , medicine , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care . It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care , and tertiary care , as well as in public health . Access to health care may vary across countries , communities , and individuals , influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes . Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations ( such as insurance coverage ) , geographic barriers ( such as additional transportation costs , possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services ) , and personal limitations ( lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers , poor health literacy , low income ) . Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services , efficacy of treatments , and overall outcome ( well-being , mortality rates ) . Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism , a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies . An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country 's economy , development and industrialization .",
  "/wiki/Investments": "To invest is to allocate money in the expectation of some benefit in the future . In finance , the benefit from an investment is called a return . The return may consist of a gain ( or loss ) realised from the sale of property or an investment , unrealised capital appreciation ( or depreciation ) , or investment income such as dividends , interest , rental income etc. , or a combination of capital gain and income . The return may also include currency gains or losses due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates . Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier their investments . When a low risk investment is made , the return is also generally low . Similarly , high risk comes with high returns . Investors , particularly novices , are often advised to adopt a particular investment strategy and diversify their portfolio . Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk .",

  "/wiki/Industry": "An industry is a sector that produces goods or related services within an economy . The major source of revenue of a group or company is an indicator of what industry it should be classified in . When a large corporate group has multiple sources of revenue generation , it is considered to be working in different industries . The manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution , upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies . This came through many successive rapid advances in technology , such as the development of steam power and the production of steel and coal . Following the Industrial Revolution , possibly a third of the economic output came from manufacturing industries . Many developed countries and many developing/semi-developed countries ( China , India etc . ) depend significantly on manufacturing industry .",
  "/wiki/Tobacco": "Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the Nicotiana genus and the Solanaceae ( nightshade ) family , and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of the tobacco plant . More than 70 species of tobacco are known , but the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum . The more potent variant N. rustica is also used around the world . Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids . Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars , as well as pipes and shishas . They can also be consumed as snuff , chewing tobacco , dipping tobacco and snus . Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many diseases ; especially those affecting the heart , liver , and lungs , as well as many cancers . In 2008 , the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world 's single greatest preventable cause of death .",
  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",
  "/wiki/Property_development": "Real estate development , or property development , is a business process , encompassing activities that range from the renovation and re-lease of existing buildings to the purchase of raw land and the sale of developed land or parcels to others . Real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities , converting ideas from paper to real property . Real estate development is different from construction , although many developers also manage the construction process . Developers buy land , finance real estate deals , build or have builders build projects , create , imagine , control , and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end . Developers usually take the greatest risk in the creation or renovation of real estate - and receive the greatest rewards . Typically , developers purchase a tract of land , determine the marketing of the property , develop the building program and design , obtain the necessary public approval and financing , build the structures , and rent out , manage , and ultimately sell it . Sometimes property developers will only undertake part of the process . For example , some developers source a property and get the plans and permits approved before selling the property with the plans and permits to a builder at a premium price . Alternatively , a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with the plans and permits in place so that they do not have the risk of failing to obtain planning approval and can start construction on the development immediately . Developers work with many different counterparts along each step of this process , including architects , city planners , engineers , surveyors , inspectors , contractors , lawyers , leasing agents , etc . In the Town and Country Planning context in the United Kingdom , 'development ' is defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 s55 .",
  "/wiki/Shopping_mall": "A shopping mall is a modern , chiefly North American , term for a form of shopping precinct or shopping center in which one or more buildings form a complex of shops with interconnecting walkways , usually indoors . In 2017 , shopping malls accounted for 8% of retailing space in the United States . A shopping arcade is a type of shopping precinct that developed earlier and in which the connecting walkways are not owned by a single proprietor and may be in the open air or covered by a ground-floor loggia . Many early shopping arcades such as the Burlington Arcade in London , the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan , and numerous arcades in Paris are famous and still trading . However , many smaller arcades have been demolished , replaced with large centers or malls , often accessible primarily by vehicle . Technical innovations such as electric lighting and escalators were introduced from the late 19th century . From the late 20th century , entertainment venues such as movie theaters and restaurants began to be added . As a single built structure , early shopping centers were often architecturally significant constructions , enabling wealthier patrons to buy goods in spaces protected from the weather .",

  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock , formed as rock strata called coal seams . Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements ; chiefly hydrogen , sulfur , oxygen , and nitrogen . Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years . Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands - called coal forests - that covered much of the Earth 's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) and Permian times . As a fossil fuel burned for heat , coal supplies about a quarter of the world 's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity . Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal . The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness . The coal industry damages the environment , including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide , 14 gigatonne ( Gt ) in 2016 , which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions . As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal , and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020 . To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C ( 3.6 \u00b0F ) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 . The largest consumer and importer of coal is China . China mines almost half the world 's coal , followed by India with about a tenth .",
  "/wiki/Electronics": "Electronics comprises the physics , engineering , technology and applications that deal with the emission , flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter . Electronics is widely used in information processing , telecommunication , and signal processing . The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible . Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards , electronics packaging technology , and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system , called an electronic system ; examples are computers or control systems . An electronic system may be a component of another engineered system or a standalone device . As of 2019 [ update ] most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control . The identification of the electron in 1897 , along with the invention of the vacuum tube , which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals , inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age . Commonly , electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements ; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit . Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes , transistors , diodes , integrated circuits , optoelectronics , and sensors , associated passive electrical components , and interconnection technologies . The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible . Electrical and electromechanical science and technology deals with the generation , distribution , switching , storage , and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms ( using wires , motors , generators , batteries , switches , relays , transformers , resistors , and other passive components ) . This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode , which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device .",
  "/wiki/Manufacturing": "Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines , tools , chemical or biological processing or formulation and is the essence of secondary industry . The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design , in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale . Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products ( such as aircraft , household appliances , furniture , sports equipment or automobiles ) , or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers ( usually through wholesalers , who in turn sell to retailers , who then sell them to individual customers ) . Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product . The manufacturing process begins with the product design , and materials specification from which the product is made . These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part . Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product 's components . Some industries , such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead . The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design . Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation , General Electric , Procter & Gamble , General Dynamics , Boeing , Pfizer , and Precision Castparts . Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group , Siemens , FCA and Michelin . Examples in Asia include Toyota , Yamaha , Panasonic , LG , Samsung and Tata Motors .",
  "/wiki/Clothing": "Clothing ( also known as clothes , apparel and attire ) is items worn on the body . Clothing is typically made of fabrics or textiles but over time has included garments made from animal skin or other thin sheets of materials put together . The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies . The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender , body type , social , and geographic considerations . Clothing serves many purposes : it can serve as protection from the elements , rough surfaces , rash-causing plants , insect bites , splinters , thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment . Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions , and they can provide a hygienic barrier , keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body . Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation . Wearing clothes is also a social norm , and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing . In most parts of the world , not wearing clothes in public so that genitals , breasts or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure .",

  "/wiki/Watches": "A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person . It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person 's activities . A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist , attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet . A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket , often attached to a chain . The study of timekeeping is known as horology . Watches progressed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks , which appeared as early as the 14th century . During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device , driven by clockwork , powered by winding a mainspring , and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel . These are called mechanical watches . In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented , which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal . By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch . Historically , this is called the quartz revolution . Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches , which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist .",
  "/wiki/Jewellery": "Jewellery or jewelry ( American English ; see spelling differences ) consists of decorative items worn for personal adornment , such as brooches , rings , necklaces , earrings , pendants , bracelets , and cufflinks . Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes . From a western perspective , the term is restricted to durable ornaments , excluding flowers for example . For many centuries metal , often combined with gemstones , has been the normal material for jewellery , but other materials such as shells and other plant materials may be used . It is one of the oldest type of archaeological artefact - with 100,000-year-old beads made from Nassarius shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery . The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived ; in European cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times , while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle , important in other cultures , are much less common . Jewellery may be made from a wide range of materials . Gemstones and similar materials such as amber and coral , precious metals , beads , and shells have been widely used , and enamel has often been important . In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol , for its material properties , its patterns , or for meaningful symbols . Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part , from hairpins to toe rings , and even genital jewellery . The patterns of wearing jewellery between the sexes , and by children and older people can vary greatly between cultures , but adult women have been the most consistent wearers of jewellery ; in modern European culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in European culture . The word jewellery itself is derived from the word jewel , which was anglicised from the Old French jouel , and beyond that , to the Latin word jocale , meaning plaything .",

  "/wiki/Banking": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit . Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets . Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries . Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities . In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity , banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords . Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world . In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties - notably , the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds - have played a central role over many centuries . The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank .",
  "/wiki/Insurance": "Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss . It is a form of risk management , primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss . An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer , insurance company , insurance carrier or underwriter . A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder . The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer 's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss . The loss may or may not be financial , but it must be reducible to financial terms , and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership , possession , or pre-existing relationship . The insured receives a contract , called the insurance policy , which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured . The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium . If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy , the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster . The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance , whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk , especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry .",
