Together , both buildings form the Citigroup Centre complex . 25 Canada Square , or Citigroup Centre 2 , stands at 200 metres ( 656 ft ) and , alongside HSBC Tower ( with which it was built in tandem ) , is the joint 4th-tallest building in the United Kingdom ( behind The Shard , One Canada Square and Heron Tower ) . Designed by C\u00e9sar Pelli & Associates , construction of the 45-storey tower - undertaken by Canary Wharf Contractors - began in 1998 and was completed in 2001 , with Citigroup leasing the building from the outset . The building was bought by RBS in 2004 along with 5 Canada Square ( leased to Bank of America ) for $ 1.12 billion . Subsequently , on 2 July 2007 , CGC2 was individually sold to a joint venture between Quinlan Private and PropInvest for \u00a31 billion ( US $ 2 billion ) . Citigroup pay \u00a346.5 million a year in rent for the tower , generating a yield of 4.6% to the owners . The east facing side of 25 Canada Square up to level 40 is configured for use by tenants . This building was bought back by Citi in 2019 . 33 Canada Square , or Citigroup Centre 1 , is the smaller of the two buildings in the complex , designed by Norman Foster and completed in 1999 , two years before its neighbour .",

  "/wiki/Stirling": "Stirling ( /\u02c8st\u025c\u02d0rl\u026a\u014b/ ; Scots : Stirlin ; Scottish Gaelic : Sruighlea [ \u02c8s\u032at\u032a\u027eu\u029dl\u0259 ] ) is a city in central Scotland , 26 miles ( 42 km ) north-east of Glasgow and 37 miles ( 60 km ) north-west of the Scottish capital , Edinburgh . The market town , surrounded by rich farmland , grew up connecting the royal citadel , the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen , the bridge and the port . Located on the River Forth , Stirling is the administrative centre for the Stirling council area , and is traditionally the county town of Stirlingshire . Proverbially it is the strategically important Gateway to the Highlands . It has been said that Stirling , like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together . Similarly he who holds Stirling , holds Scotland is often quoted . Stirling 's key position as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth made it a focal point for travel north or south . When Stirling was temporarily under Anglo-Saxon sway , according to a 9th-century legend , it was attacked by Danish invaders . The sound of a wolf roused a sentry , however , who alerted his garrison , which forced a Viking retreat . This led to the wolf being adopted as a symbol of the town as is shown on the 1511 Stirling Jug . The area is today known as Wolfcraig . Even today the wolf appears with a goshawk on the council 's coat of arms along with the recently chosen motto : Steadfast as the Rock .",
