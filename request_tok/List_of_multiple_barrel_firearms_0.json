  "/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)": "A cartridge or a round is a type of pre-assembled firearm ammunition packaging a projectile ( bullet , shot , or slug ) , a propellant substance ( usually either smokeless powder or black powder ) and an ignition device ( primer ) within a metallic , paper or plastic case that is precisely made to fit within the barrel chamber of a breechloading gun , for the practical purpose of convenient transportation and handling during shooting . Although in popular usage the term bullet is often used to refer to a complete cartridge , it is correctly used only to refer to the projectile . Cartridges can be categorized by the type of their primers - a small charge of an impact- or electric-sensitive chemical mixture that is located at the center of the case head ( centerfire ) , inside the rim of the case base ( rimfire and the cupfire , now obsolete ) , in a sideway projection that is shaped like a pin ( pinfire , now obsolete ) or a lip ( lipfire , now obsolete ) , or in a small nipple-like bulge at the case base ( teat-fire , now obsolete ) . Military and commercial producers continue to pursue the goal of caseless ammunition . Some artillery ammunition uses the same cartridge concept as found in small arms . In other cases , the artillery shell is separate from the propellant charge . A cartridge without a projectile is called a blank . One that is completely inert ( contains no active primer and no propellant ) is called a dummy . One that failed to ignite and shoot off the projectile is called a dud , and one that ignited but failed to sufficiently push the projectile out of the barrel is called a squib .",

  "/wiki/.38_Super": "The .38 Super , also known as .38 Superauto or .38 Super Auto , is a pistol cartridge that fires a 0.356-inch-diameter ( 9.04 mm ) bullet . The Super was introduced in the late 1920s as a higher pressure loading of the .38 ACP or .38 Auto . The old .38 ACP propelled a 130-grain ( 8.4 g ) bullet at 1,050 ft/s ( 320.0 m/s ) . The improved .38 Super Auto pushed the same 130-grain ( 8.4 g ) bullet at 1,280 ft/s ( 390.1 m/s ) . The .38 Super has gained distinction as the caliber of choice for many top pistol match competitors ; it remains one of the dominant calibers in IPSC competition .",
  "/wiki/.45_ACP": "The .45 ACP ( Automatic Colt Pistol ) or .45 Auto ( 11.43\u00d723mm ) is a handgun cartridge designed by John Moses Browning in 1904 , for use in his prototype Colt semi-automatic pistol . After successful military trials , it was adopted as the standard chambering for Colt 's M1911 pistol.The round was developed due to a lack of stopping power experienced in the Moro Rebellion using the .38 Long Colt . This experience and the Thompson-LaGarde Tests of 1904 , led the Army and the Cavalry to decide a minimum of .45 caliber was required in a new handgun . The standard issue military .45 ACP round has a 230-grain bullet that travels at approximately 830 feet per second when fired from the government issue M1911A1 pistol . It operates at a relatively low maximum chamber pressure rating of 21,000 psi ( 145 MPa ) ( compared to 35,000 psi/241 MPa for 9mm Parabellum ) , which due to a low bolt thrust helps extend service life of weapons . Due to standard pressure .45 ACP rounds fired from handguns and submachine guns are inherently subsonic , and are useful in suppressed weapons to eliminate the sonic boom . Today , most NATO militaries use sidearms chambered for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge , but the effectiveness of the .45 ACP cartridge has ensured its continued popularity with large caliber sport shooters , especially in the United States . In 1985 , the .45 ACP M1911A1 pistol was replaced by the Beretta M9 9mm pistol as the main sidearm of the U.S. military , which in turn was replaced with the SIG Sauer P320 designated M17 for the full size and M18 for the compact .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

  "/wiki/.22_Short": ".22 Short is a variety of .22 caliber ( 5.6 mm ) rimfire ammunition . Developed in 1857 for the first Smith & Wesson revolver , the .22 rimfire was the first American metallic cartridge . The original loading was a 29 or 30 gr ( 0.066 or 0.069 oz ; 1.879 or 1.944 g ) bullet and 4 gr ( 0.0091 oz ; 0.2592 g ) of black powder . The original .22 rimfire cartridge was renamed .22 Short with the introduction of the .22 Long in 1871 . Developed for self defense , the modern .22 Short , though still used in a few pocket pistols and mini-revolvers , is mainly used as a quiet round for practice by the recreational shooter . The .22 Short was popularly used in shooting galleries at fairs and arcades ; several rifle makers produced gallery models for .22 Short exclusively . Due to its low recoil and good inherent accuracy , the .22 Short was used for the Olympic 25 meter rapid fire pistol event until 2004 , and they were allowed in the shooting part of modern pentathlon competitions before they switched to air pistols . Several makes of starter pistols use .22 Short blank cartridges . Some powder-actuated nail guns use the .22 Short cartridge as a power source .",
  "/wiki/.22_Long": ".22 Long is a variety of .22 caliber ( 5.6 mm ) rimfire ammunition . The .22 Long is the second-oldest of the surviving rimfire cartridges , dating back to 1871 , when it was loaded with a 29 grain ( 1.9 g ) bullet and 5 grains ( 0.32 g ) of black powder , 25% more than the .22 Short it was based on . It was designed for use in revolvers , but was soon chambered in rifles as well , in which it gained a strong reputation as a small game cartridge , and sold very well . In 1887 the .22 Long case was combined with the heavier 40 grain ( 2.6 g ) bullet of the .22 Extra Long of 1880 to produce the .22 Long Rifle giving a longer overall length , a higher muzzle energy and superior performance as a hunting and target round , rendering the .22 Long and .22 Extra Long obsolete . Many firearms designed for the .22 Long Rifle will chamber and fire the shorter round , though the .22 Long generally does not generate sufficient energy to operate semi-automatic guns . The one prominent survivor of the .22 Long is the .22 CB Long , a long-cased version of the .22 CB . While the original .22 Long loading used the same powder charge as the .22 Long Rifle , the .22 Long bullet was significantly lighter , and the combination did not result in higher velocities for the .22 Long when fired from a rifle . The large barrel volume to chamber volume ratio of a .22 rimfire rifle means that the powder gasses have expanded as far as they can well before the bullet reaches the muzzle of a normal length rifle barrel , and the light .22 Long bullet has less inertia than the .22 Long Rifle . This means that the .22 Long bullet ( and to a lesser extent the .22 Long Rifle in most loadings ) actually slows down significantly before it exits the barrel . For farmers , or for those who only hunted small game such as squirrel or cottontail rabbit , the differences in performance between the .22 Long and .22 Long Rifle cartridges were of little importance . The quieter report and lower penetration of the .22 Long cartridge were often seen as desirable qualities . Since the .22 Long Rifle performs as well in a short handgun barrel as the .22 Long and outperforms it significantly in a long rifle barrel , the development of the .22 Long Rifle assured the .22 Long 's path to obsolescence .",

  "/wiki/Howdah_pistol": "The howdah pistol was a large-calibre handgun , often with two or four barrels , used in India and Africa from the beginning of the nineteenth century , and into the early twentieth century , during the British Empire era . It was typically intended for defence against tigers , lions , and other dangerous animals that might be encountered in remote areas . Multi-barreled breech-loading designs were later favoured over contemporary revolvers , due to their higher velocity and faster reloading potential . The term howdah pistol comes from the howdah , a large platform mounted on the back of an elephant . Hunters , particularly in British Raj India , used howdahs as a platform for hunting , and needed large-calibre side-arms for protection against close quarters animal attacks . The practice of hunting from the howdah basket on top of an Asian elephant was first made popular by the joint Anglo-Indian East India Company during the 1790s . The early howdah pistols were flintlock designs , and it was not until about 60 years later that percussion models in single or double barrel configuration were seen . By the 1890s and early 1900s cartridge-firing and fully rifled howdah pistols were standard . The first breech-loading howdah pistols were little more than sawn-off rifles , typically in .577 Snider or .577/450 Martini-Henry calibre . This was practical in that the huntsman could use the same ammunition in rifle and pistol , as well as being a powerful round . Later English firearms makers manufactured specially-designed howdah pistols in both rifle calibres and standard pistol calibres such as .455 Webley and .476 Enfield . As a result , the term howdah pistol is often applied to a number of English multi-barrelled handguns including the Lancaster pistol ( available in a variety of calibres from .380 to .577 ) , and various .577 calibre revolvers produced in England and Europe for a brief time in the mid-late 19th century .",

Early .577 Snider cartridges were made from paper , with a metallic base and primer , but later commercial cartridges were made from drawn brass , much like modern small arms ammunition . The .577 Snider cartridge was eventually replaced in service by the .577/450 Martini-Henry cartridge in the 1870s . The .577 Snider cartridge is considered by most commentators to be obsolete , with large scale commercial production having ceased in the 1930s .

In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",
  "/wiki/Henrion,_Dassy_&_Heuschen_double-barrel_revolvers": "The Henrion , Dassy & Heuschen double-barrel revolver was a type of revolver with two stacked barrels and two concentric sets of chambers , each serving its own barrel . They were fired by a single hammer which had two firing pins . The chambers were staggered , such that the gun fired only round at a time . These revolvers were based on a 1910 patent held by the Belgian firm of Henrion , Dassy & Heuschen ( HDH ) , and were made in various calibers . The 6.35 mm and 6.5 Velodog varieties had 20 chambers , while the 7.65 mm variant had 16 chambers . For reloading they broke open along a hinge on the top-rear of the frame , like the Spirlet revolver . They were manufactured from 1911 to 1928 and were marketed under a variety of names that were supposed to denote power and masculinity . Names such as Wild West , Redoubtable , or even Machine-gun HDH were used for promotional purposes . The arrangement itself was not new , having been tried in the Lefaucheux 20-round double-barreled , pinfire revolver of 1862 . The Ludovici revolver is a derivative .",
