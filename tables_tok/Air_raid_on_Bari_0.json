  "section_text": "Allied ships burn during the raid . The attack opened at 19:25 , when two or three German aircraft circled the harbour at 10,000 ft ( 3,000 m ) dropping D\u00fcppel ( foil strips ) to confuse Allied radar . They also dropped flares , which were not needed due to the harbour being well illuminated . [ 4 ] The German bomber force surprised the defenders and was able to bomb the harbour with great accuracy . Hits on two ammunition ships caused explosions which shattered windows 7 mi ( 11 km ) away . [ 4 ] A bulk petrol pipeline on a quay was severed and the gushing fuel ignited . [ 7 ] A sheet of burning fuel spread over much of the harbor , engulfing undamaged ships . [ 4 ] Twenty-eight merchant ships laden with more than 34,000 short tons ( 31,000 t ) of cargo were sunk or destroyed ; three ships carrying a further 7,500 short tons ( 6,800 t ) were later salvaged . [ 2 ] Twelve more ships were damaged . [ 8 ] The port was closed for three weeks and was only restored to full operation in February 1944 . [ 7 ] All Bari-based submarines were undamaged , their tough exteriors able to withstand the German attack .",

  "intro": "The air raid on Bari (German: Luftangriff auf den Hafen von Bari, Italian: Bombardamento di Bari) was an air attack by German bombers on Allied forces and shipping in Bari, Italy on 2 December 1943 during World War II. In the attack, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers of Luftflotte 2 achieved surprise and bombed shipping and personnel operating in support of the Allied Italian Campaign, sinking 27 cargo and transport ships and a schooner in Bari harbour. The attack lasted a little more than one hour and put the port out of action until February 1944. The release of mustard gas from one of the wrecked cargo ships added to the loss of life. The British and US governments covered up the presence of mustard gas and its effects on victims of the raid."
