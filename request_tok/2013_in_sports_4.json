  "/wiki/World_Rally_Championship": "The World Rally Championship ( WRC ) is a rallying series organised by the FIA , culminating with a champion driver , co-driver and manufacturer . The driver 's world championship and manufacturer 's world championship are separate championships , but based on the same point system . The series currently consists of 14 three-day events driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and tarmac to snow and ice . Each rally is split into 15-25 special stages which are run against the clock on closed roads . The WRC was formed from well-known and popular international rallies , most of which had previously been part of the European Rally Championship or the International Championship for Manufacturers , and the series was first contested in 1973 . The World Rally Car is the current car specification in the series . It evolved from Group A cars which replaced the banned Group B supercars . World Rally Cars are built on production 1.6-litre four-cylinder cars , but feature turbochargers , anti-lag systems , four-wheel-drive , sequential gearboxes , aerodynamic parts and other enhancements bringing the price of a WRC car to around US $ 1 million ( \u20ac700,000 / \u00a3500,000 ) . The WRC features three support championships , the Junior World Rally Championship ( JWRC , formerly the WRC Academy ) , the World Rally Championship-2 ( WRC 2 , formerly the Super 2000 World Rally Championship ) , and the World Rally Championship-3 ( WRC-3 , formerly the Production World Rally Championship ) which are contested on the same events and stages as the WRC , but with different regulations . The WRC-2 , WRC-3 and junior entrants race through the stages after the WRC drivers .",

He competed for the Citro\u00ebn World Rally Team in the World Rally Championship ( WRC ) and is the most successful driver in WRC history , having won the world championship a record nine times in a row . He holds several other WRC records , including most event wins , most podium finishes and most stage wins . Loeb announced his retirement from World Rallying at the end of the 2012 season .

  "/wiki/Citro\u00ebn_DS3_WRC": "The Citro\u00ebn DS3 WRC is the World Rally Car built for the Citro\u00ebn World Rally Team by Citro\u00ebn Racing for use from the 2011 World Rally Championship season . It is based upon the Citro\u00ebn DS3 road car , and replaced the highly successful Citro\u00ebn C4 WRC . It was built to the new World Rally Car regulations for 2011 , which were based upon the existing Super 2000 regulations , but is powered by a turbocharged 1.6-litre engine rather than the normally aspirated 2-litre engine found in Super 2000 cars . Development work on the car had been carried out during 2010 by Citro\u00ebn drivers S\u00e9bastien Loeb , Dani Sordo , S\u00e9bastien Ogier and test driver Philippe Bugalski as well as sister Peugeot drivers Kris Meeke and St\u00e9phane Sarrazin . The engine has been specifically developed for this car ( older regulations required that the engine be based on an existing mass-produced engine 's cylinder block and head gasket ) . It officially develops 300 bhp ( 220 kW ) at 6,000 rpm and 350 N\u22c5m ( 36 kgf\u22c5m ) at 3,250 rpm . In October 2012 , Citro\u00ebn announced the DS3 RRC intended for use in the championships below that of the WRC : WRC-2 ( formerly S-WRC ) , European Rally Championship ( ERC ) , Middle East Rally Championship ( MERC ) , some national championships and so on . Visually and internally , the two models ( DS3 WRC and RRC ) are different since the regulations are more restrictive on the RRC . For example , the WRC 1.6-litre turbocharged direct-injection engine has been slightly modified dropping the power from 300 bhp ( 220 kW ) to 275 bhp ( 205 kW ) , visually the bumper intakes are smaller and the rear spoiler complies with the S2000 standards . The other significant change concerns the brakes in tarmac configuration : the diameter of the discs has been reduced from 355 to 350 mm and the water-cooling system has been removed . At the 2016 Rally Finland , Kris Meeke established a new record for the fastest FIA WRC round in history , with a 126.60 km/h average speed .",

Horse races vary widely in format and many countries have developed their own particular traditions around the sport . Variations include restricting races to particular breeds , running over obstacles , running over different distances , running on different track surfaces and running in different gaits . While horses are sometimes raced purely for sport , a major part of horse racing 's interest and economic importance is in the gambling associated with it , an activity that in 2008 generated a worldwide market worth around US $ 115 billion .",

Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3 , 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company . Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2 , 1918 and propelled himself back to the GM presidency . After Durant 's second ousting in 1919 , Alfred Sloan , with his maxim a car for every purse and purpose , would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family , selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford 's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 . Chevrolet-branded vehicles are sold in most automotive markets worldwide . In Oceania , Chevrolet is represented by Holden Special Vehicles , having returned to the region in 2018 after a 50-year absence with the launching of the Camaro and Silverado pickup truck ( HSV was partially and formerly owned by GM subsidiary Holden , which GM is retiring in 2020 ) . In 2005 , Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe , primarily selling vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet , a move rooted in General Motors ' attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet . With the reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe , GM intended Chevrolet to be a mainstream value brand , while GM 's traditional European standard-bearers , Opel of Germany , and Vauxhall of United Kingdom would be moved upmarket . However , GM reversed this move in late 2013 , announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe , with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette in 2016 . Chevrolet vehicles will continue to be marketed in the CIS states , including Russia . After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in 2011 to create GM Korea , the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet .

  "/wiki/Tennis": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .",

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .

  "/wiki/Table_tennis": "Table tennis , also known as ping-pong , is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small rackets . The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net . Except for the initial serve , the rules are generally as follows : players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table , and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once . A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules . Play is fast and demands quick reactions . Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent 's options , giving the hitter a great advantage . Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation ( ITTF ) , founded in 1926 . ITTF currently includes 226 member associations . The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook . Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988 , with several event categories .

That success was Calumet Farm 's first win in a Triple Crown race in 45 years and breeder Richard Santulli 's first win in a Triple Crown classic race . It also was Stevens ' first Triple Crown win since 2001 , following his return to riding in early 2013 after a seven-year retirement , and Lukas ' first Triple Crown win since 2000 .
