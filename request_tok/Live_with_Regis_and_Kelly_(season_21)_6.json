Van Morrison rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R & B band Them , with whom he recorded the garage band classic Gloria . His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single Brown Eyed Girl in 1967 . After Berns 's death , Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks ( 1968 ) . Though this album gradually garnered high praise , it was initially a poor seller . Morrison has a reputation for being at once stubborn , idiosyncratic , and sublime . His live performances at their best are seen as transcendental and inspired ; while some of his recordings , such as the studio albums Astral Weeks and Moondance , and the live album It 's Too Late to Stop Now , are highly acclaimed . Moondance ( 1970 ) established Morrison as a major artist , and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances . He continues to record and tour , producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received , sometimes collaborating with other artists , such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains . Much of Morrison 's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R & B , such as the popular singles Brown Eyed Girl , Jackie Wilson Said ( I 'm in Heaven When You Smile ) , Domino and Wild Night . An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy , loosely connected , spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition , jazz and stream-of-consciousness narrative , such as the album Astral Weeks and the lesser known Veedon Fleece and Common One .",
