Similarly , acronyms are sometimes pronounced as words , as in NASA or UNESCO , sometimes as the individual letters , as in FBI or ATM , or a mixture of the two , as in JPEG or IUPAC . The broader sense of acronym inclusive of terms pronounced as the individual letters ( such as TNT ) , is sometimes proscribed , but is the term 's original and more common meaning . Language authorities such as dictionary and style guide editors are not in universal agreement on the naming for such abbreviations - in particular it is a matter of some dispute whether the term acronym can be legitimately applied to abbreviations which are not pronounced as words - or the correct use of space , case , and punctuation .

Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam , later renamed Thailand , during the late-19th century , as the country faced pressures from the West .
