For example , the type site of the pre-Celtic/Celtic Bronze Age Hallstatt culture is the lakeside village of Hallstatt , Austria . In geology the term is used similarly for a site considered to be typical of a particular rock formation etc . A type site contains artifacts , in an assemblage , that are typical of that culture . Type sites are often the first or foundational site discovered about the culture they represent . The use of this term is therefore similar to that of the specimen type in biology ( see biological types ) or locus typicus ( type locality ) in geology .",
  "/wiki/Clovis_culture": "The Clovis culture is a prehistoric Paleoamerican culture , named for distinct stone tools found in close association with Pleistocene fauna at Blackwater Locality No . 1 near Clovis , New Mexico , in the 1920s and 1930s . It appears around 11,500-11,000 uncalibrated RCYBP at the end of the last glacial period , and is characterized by the manufacture of Clovis points and distinctive bone and ivory tools . Archaeologists ' most precise determinations at present suggest this radiocarbon age is equal to roughly 13,200 to 12,900 calendar years ago . Clovis people are considered to be the ancestors of most of the indigenous cultures of the Americas . The only human burial that has been directly associated with tools from the Clovis culture included the remains of an infant boy researchers named Anzick-1 . Paleogenetic analyses of Anzick-1 's ancient nuclear , mitochondrial , and Y-chromosome DNA reveal that Anzick-1 is closely related to modern Native American populations , which lends support to the Beringia hypothesis for the settlement of the Americas . The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward . Post-Clovis cultures include the Folsom tradition , Gainey , Suwannee-Simpson , Plainview-Goshen , Cumberland , and Redstone . Each of these is thought to derive directly from Clovis , in some cases apparently differing only in the length of the fluting on their projectile points . Although this is generally held to be the result of normal cultural change through time , numerous other reasons have been suggested as driving forces to explain changes in the archaeological record , such as the Younger Dryas postglacial climate change which exhibited numerous faunal extinctions . After the discovery of several Clovis sites in eastern North America in the 1930s , the Clovis people came to be regarded as the first human inhabitants who created a widespread culture in the New World .",

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",

Dubbed the Gettysburg of the West ( a term that serves the novelist better than the historian ) by some authors , it was intended as the decisive blow by Confederate forces to break the Union possession of the West along the base of the Rocky Mountains . It was fought at Glorieta Pass in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in what is now New Mexico , and was an important event in the history of the New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War . There was a skirmish on March 26 between advance elements from each army , with the main battle occurring on March 28 . Although the Confederates were able to push the Union force back through the pass , they had to retreat when their supply train was destroyed and most of their horses and mules killed or driven off . Eventually the Confederates had to withdraw entirely from the territory back into Confederate Arizona and then Texas . Glorieta Pass thus represented the climax of the campaign .",

It is located a short distance northwest of Santa Fe , New Mexico in the southwestern US . Los Alamos was selected as the top secret location for bomb design in late 1942 , and officially commissioned the next year , under the management of University of California . At the time it was known as Project Y and was the center for weapon design and overall coordination . Other labs , today known as Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Hanford Site , concentrated on the production of uranium and plutonium bomb fuels . Los Alamos was the heart of the project , collecting together some of the world 's most famous scientists , among them numerous Nobel Prize winners . The site was known variously as Project Y , Los Alamos Laboratory , and Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory through this period . The lab 's existence was announced to the world in the post-WWII era , when it became known universally as Los Alamos . In 1952 , the Atomic Energy Commission formed a second design lab under the direction of the University of California , Berkeley , becoming the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) . Since that date the two labs have competed on a wide variety of bomb designs . With the ending of the Cold War , both labs turned their focus increasingly to civilian missions .

  "/wiki/Manhattan_Project": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons . It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada . From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $ 2 billion ( about $ 23 billion in 2018 dollars ) . Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada . Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war : a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon . The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium , and therefore a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235 , an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium . Chemically identical to the most common isotope , uranium-238 , and with almost the same mass , it proved difficult to separate the two .",
