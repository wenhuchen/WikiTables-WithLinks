The sale was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on October 24 , 2006 , and finalized on October 31 , 2006 , at which point the new ownership group took control . After failing to find public funding to construct a new arena in the Seattle area , the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City before the 2008-09 season , following a $ 45 million settlement with the city of Seattle to pay off the team 's existing lease at KeyArena at Seattle Center in advance of its 2010 expiration .
