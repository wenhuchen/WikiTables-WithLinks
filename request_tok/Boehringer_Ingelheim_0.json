  "/wiki/Long-acting_beta-agonist": "Long-acting \u03b2 adrenoceptor agonists ( LABAs , more specifically , long-acting \u03b22 adrenergic receptor agonists ) are usually prescribed for moderate-to-severe persistent asthma patients or patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . They are designed to reduce the need for shorter-acting \u03b22 agonists such as salbutamol ( albuterol ) , as they have a duration of action of approximately 12 hours in comparison with the 4-to-6-hour duration of salbutamol , making them candidates for sparing high doses of corticosteroids [ citation needed ] or treating nocturnal asthma and providing symptomatic improvement in patients with COPD . With the exception of formoterol , long-acting \u03b22 agonists are not recommended for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations because of their slower onset of action compared to salbutamol . Their long duration of action is due to the addition of a long , lipophilic side-chain that binds to an exosite on adrenergic receptors . This allows the active portion of the molecule to continuously bind and unbind at \u03b22 receptors in the smooth muscle in the lungs .",
  "/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term breathing problems and poor airflow . The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production . COPD is a progressive disease , meaning it typically worsens over time . Eventually , everyday activities such as walking or getting dressed become difficult . Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD . The term chronic bronchitis is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years . Those with such a cough are at a greater risk of developing COPD . The term emphysema is also used for the abnormal presence of air or other gas within tissues . Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD , with factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role . In the developing world , one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires . Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs , resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue . The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests .",
  "/wiki/Tiotropium": "Tiotropium bromide , sold under the brandname Spiriva among others , is a long-acting bronchodilator used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and asthma . Specifically it is used to try to prevent periods of worsening rather than for those periods themselves . It is used by inhalation through the mouth . Onset typically begins within half an hour and lasts for 24 hours . Common side effects include a dry mouth , runny nose , upper respiratory tract infection , shortness of breath and headache . Severe side effects may include angioedema , worsening bronchospasm , and QT prolongation . Tentative evidence has not found harm during pregnancy , however , such use has not been well studied . It is an anticholinergic medication and works by blocking acetylcholine action on smooth muscle . Tiotropium was patented in 1989 , and approved for medical use in 2002 . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system . In the United States the wholesale cost was about US $ 13.75 per dose as of 2019 . In the United Kingdom a dose costs the NHS about 0.86 pounds as of 2019 .",
  "/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis": "Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs , but also the pancreas , liver , kidneys , and intestine . Long-term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections . Other signs and symptoms may include sinus infections , poor growth , fatty stool , clubbing of the fingers and toes , and infertility in most males . Different people may have different degrees of symptoms . CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner . It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein . Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly healthy . CFTR is involved in the production of sweat , digestive fluids , and mucus . When the CFTR is not functional , secretions which are usually thin instead become thick . The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing . Screening of infants at birth takes place in some areas of the world . There is no known cure for cystic fibrosis .",
  "/wiki/Asthma": "Asthma is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs . It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms , reversible airflow obstruction , and easily triggered bronchospasms . Symptoms include episodes of wheezing , coughing , chest tightness , and shortness of breath . These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week . Depending on the person , asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise . Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens . Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers . Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms , response to therapy over time , and spirometry lung function testing . Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms , forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) , and peak expiratory flow rate . It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic , where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction . There is no cure for asthma .",

  "/wiki/VEGFR": "VEGF receptors are receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . There are three main subtypes of VEGFR , numbered 1 , 2 and 3 . Also , they may be membrane-bound ( mbVEGFR ) or soluble ( sVEGFR ) , depending on alternative splicing . Inhibitors of VEGFR are used in the treatment of cancer .",
  "/wiki/FGFR": "The fibroblast growth factor receptors ( FGFR ) are , as their name implies , receptors that bind to members of the fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) family of proteins . Some of these receptors are involved in pathological conditions . For example , a point mutation in FGFR3 can lead to achondroplasia .",
  "/wiki/PDGFR": "Platelet-derived growth factor receptors ( PDGF-R ) are cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors for members of the platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) family . PDGF subunits -A and -B are important factors regulating cell proliferation , cellular differentiation , cell growth , development and many diseases including cancer . There are two forms of the PDGF-R , alpha and beta each encoded by a different gene . Depending on which growth factor is bound , PDGF-R homo- or heterodimerizes .",
  "/wiki/Idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a type of chronic scarring lung disease characterized by a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function . Symptoms typically include gradual onset of shortness of breath and a dry cough . Other changes may include feeling tired , and abnormally large and dome shaped finger and toenails ( nail clubbing ) . Complications may include pulmonary hypertension , heart failure , pneumonia , or pulmonary embolism . The cause is unknown . Risk factors include cigarette smoking , certain viral infections , and a family history of the condition . The underlying mechanism involves scarring of the lungs . Diagnosis requires ruling out other potential causes . It may be supported by a CT scan or lung biopsy which show usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP ) . It is a type of interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) . People often benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation and supplemental oxygen . Certain medications like pirfenidone or nintedanib may slow the progression of the disease .",
  "/wiki/Non-small_cell_lung_cancer": "Non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) is any type of epithelial lung cancer other than small cell lung carcinoma ( SCLC ) . NSCLC accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers . As a class , NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to chemotherapy , compared to small cell carcinoma . When possible , they are primarily treated by surgical resection with curative intent , although chemotherapy has been used increasingly both pre-operatively ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) and post-operatively ( adjuvant chemotherapy ) .",
  "/wiki/Ovarian_cancer": "Ovarian cancer is a cancer that forms in or on an ovary . It results in abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body . When this process begins , there may be no or only vague symptoms . Symptoms become more noticeable as the cancer progresses . These symptoms may include bloating , pelvic pain , abdominal swelling , and loss of appetite , among others . Common areas to which the cancer may spread include the lining of the abdomen , lymph nodes , lungs , and liver . The risk of ovarian cancer increases in women who have ovulated more over their lifetime . This includes those who have never had children , those who begin ovulation at a younger age and those who reach menopause at an older age . Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause , fertility medication , and obesity . Factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control , tubal ligation , and breast feeding . About 10% of cases are related to inherited genetic risk ; women with mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 have about a 50% chance of developing the disease . Ovarian carcinoma is the most common type of ovarian cancer , comprising more than 95% of cases .",
  "/wiki/Afatinib": "Afatinib , sold under the brand name Gilotrif among others , is a medication used to treat non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) . It belongs to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor family of medications . It is taken by mouth .

  "/wiki/ErbB": "The ErbB family of proteins contains four receptor tyrosine kinases , structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , its first discovered member . In humans , the family includes Her1 ( EGFR , ErbB1 ) , Her2 ( Neu , ErbB2 ) , Her3 ( ErbB3 ) , and Her4 ( ErbB4 ) . The gene symbol , ErbB , is derived from the name of a viral oncogene to which these receptors are homologous : erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene . Insufficient ErbB signaling in humans is associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases , such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer 's Disease , while excessive ErbB signaling is associated with the development of a wide variety of types of solid tumor . ErbB protein family signaling is important for development . For example , ErbB-2 and ErbB-4 knockout mice die at midgestation leads to deficient cardiac function associated with a lack of myocardial ventricular trabeculation and display abnormal development of the peripheral nervous system . In ErbB-3 receptor mutant mice , they have less severe defects in the heart and thus are able to survive longer throughout embryogenesis . Lack of Schwann cell maturation leads to degeneration of motor and sensory neurons . Excessive ErbB signaling is associated with the development of a wide variety of types of solid tumor . ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 are found in many human cancers , and their excessive signaling may be critical factors in the development and malignancy of these tumors .",
  "/wiki/Breast_cancer": "Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue . Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast , a change in breast shape , dimpling of the skin , fluid coming from the nipple , a newly-inverted nipple , or a red or scaly patch of skin . In those with distant spread of the disease , there may be bone pain , swollen lymph nodes , shortness of breath , or yellow skin . Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female , obesity , lack of physical exercise , drinking alcohol , hormone replacement therapy during menopause , ionizing radiation , early age at first menstruation , having children late or not at all , older age , prior history of breast cancer , and family history . About 5-10% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person 's parents , including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others . Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk . Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas , while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas . In addition , there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer . Some cancers , such as ductal carcinoma in situ , develop from pre-invasive lesions . The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump . Once the diagnosis is made , further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective . The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial .",
  "/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer": "Head and neck cancer is a group of cancers that starts in the mouth , nose , throat , larynx , sinuses , or salivary glands . Symptoms for head and neck cancer may include a lump or sore that does not heal , a sore throat that does not go away , trouble swallowing , or a change in the voice . There may also be unusual bleeding , facial swelling , or trouble breathing . About 75% of head and neck cancer is caused by the use of alcohol or tobacco . Other risk factors include betel quid , certain types of human papillomavirus , radiation exposure , certain workplace exposures , and Epstein-Barr virus . About 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell cancers . The diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy . The degree of spread may be determined by medical imaging and blood tests . Not using tobacco or alcohol can reduce the risk for head and neck cancer . While screening in the general population does not appear to be useful , screening high risk groups by examination of the throat might be useful . Head and neck cancer often is curable if it is diagnosed early ; however , outcomes are typically poor if it is diagnosed late . Treatment may include a combination of surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , and targeted therapy .",

  "/wiki/Deleobuvir": "Deleobuvir ( formerly BI 207127 ) was an experimental drug for the treatment of hepatitis C. It was being developed by Boehringer Ingelheim . It is a non-nucleoside hepatitis C virus NS5B polymerase inhibitor . Deleobuvir was tested in combination regimens with pegylated interferon and ribavirin , and in interferon-free regimens with other direct-acting antiviral agents including faldaprevir . Data from the SOUND-C2 study , presented at the 2012 AASLD Liver Meeting , showed that a triple combination of deleobuvir , faldaprevir , and ribavirin performed well in HCV genotype 1b patients . Efficacy fell below 50% , however , for dual regimens without ribavirin and for genotype 1a patients . These results were confirmed in the SOUND-C3 study , presented at the 2013 APASL Liver Conference , which found that 16-week triple therapy with deleobuvir + faldaprevir + ribavirin gave 95% SVR12 in HCV genotype 1b patients but poor virological response in genotype 1a . In December 2013 , Boehringer Ingelheim announced that the development of deleobuvir would not be continued since recent findings from phase III trials did not suggest sufficient efficacy .",
  "/wiki/NS5B": "Nonstructural protein 5B ( NS5B ) is a viral protein found in the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . It is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase , having the key function of replicating HCV 's viral RNA by using the viral positive RNA strand as a template to catalyze the polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates ( rNTP ) during RNA replication . Several crystal structures of NS5B polymerase in several crystalline forms have been determined based on the same consensus sequence BK ( HCV-BK , genotype 1 ) . The structure can be represented by a right hand shape with fingers , palm , and thumb . The encircled active site , unique to NS5B , is contained within the palm structure of the protein . Recent studies on NS5B protein genotype 1b strain J4s ( HC-J4 ) structure indicate a presence of an active site where possible control of nucleotide binding occurs and initiation of de-novo RNA synthesis . De-novo adds necessary primers for initiation of RNA replication .",
  "/wiki/Hepatitis_C": "Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) that primarily affects the liver . During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms . Occasionally a fever , dark urine , abdominal pain , and yellow tinged skin occurs . The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected . Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms . Over many years however , it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis . In some cases , those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure , liver cancer , or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach . HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use , poorly sterilized medical equipment , needlestick injuries in healthcare , and transfusions . Using blood screening , the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million . It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth . It is not spread by superficial contact . It is one of five known hepatitis viruses : A , B , C , D , and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA .",

Common symptoms include increased thirst , frequent urination , and unexplained weight loss . Symptoms may also include increased hunger , feeling tired , and sores that do not heal . Often symptoms come on slowly . Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease , strokes , diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness , kidney failure , and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations . The sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur ; however , ketoacidosis is uncommon . Type 2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise . Some people are more genetically at risk than others . Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes , with the other 10% due primarily to type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes . In type 1 diabetes there is a lower total level of insulin to control blood glucose , due to an autoimmune induced loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas . Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose , oral glucose tolerance test , or glycated hemoglobin ( A1C ) . Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable by staying a normal weight , exercising regularly , and eating properly .",

  "/wiki/Anticoagulation": "Anticoagulants , commonly known as blood thinners , are chemical substances that prevent or reduce coagulation of blood , prolonging the clotting time . Some of them occur naturally in blood-eating animals such as leeches and mosquitoes , where they help keep the bite area unclotted long enough for the animal to obtain some blood . As a class of medications , anticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombotic disorders . Oral anticoagulants ( OACs ) are taken by many people in pill or tablet form , and various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in hospitals . Some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment , such as sample tubes , blood transfusion bags , heart-lung machines , and dialysis equipment . One of the first anticoagulant , warfarin , was initially approved as a rodenticide . Anticoagulants are closely related to antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic drugs by manipulating the various pathways of blood coagulation . Specifically , antiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation ( clumping together ) , whereas anticoagulants inhibit specific pathways of the coagulation cascade , which happens after the initial platelet aggregation and ultimately leads to formation of fibrin and stable aggregated platelet products . Common anticoagulants include warfarin and heparin ."
