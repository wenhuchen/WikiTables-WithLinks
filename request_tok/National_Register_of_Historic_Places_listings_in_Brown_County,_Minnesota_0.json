  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/Bas-relief": "Relief is a sculptural technique where the sculpted elements remain attached to a solid background of the same material . The term relief is from the Latin verb relevo , to raise . To create a sculpture in relief is to give the impression that the sculpted material has been raised above the background plane . What is actually performed when a relief is cut in from a flat surface of stone ( relief sculpture ) or wood ( relief carving ) is a lowering of the field , leaving the unsculpted parts seemingly raised . The technique involves considerable chiselling away of the background , which is a time-consuming exercise . On the other hand , a relief saves forming the rear of a subject , and is less fragile and more securely fixed than a sculpture in the round , especially one of a standing figure where the ankles are a potential weak point , especially in stone . In other materials such as metal , clay , plaster stucco , ceramics or papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 the form can be just added to or raised up from the background , and monumental bronze reliefs are made by casting . There are different degrees of relief depending on the degree of projection of the sculpted form from the field , for which the Italian and French terms are still sometimes used in English . The full range includes high relief ( alto-rilievo , haut-relief ) , where more than 50% of the depth is shown and there may be undercut areas , mid-relief ( mezzo-rilievo ) , low-relief ( basso-rilievo , or French : bas-relief ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ ba\u0281lij\u025bf ] ) , and shallow-relief or rilievo schiacciato , where the plane is only very slightly lower than the sculpted elements . There is also sunk relief , which was mainly restricted to Ancient Egypt ( see below ) . However , the distinction between high relief and low relief is the clearest and most important , and these two are generally the only terms used to discuss most work . The definition of these terms is somewhat variable , and many works combine areas in more than one of them , sometimes sliding between them in a single figure ; accordingly some writers prefer to avoid all distinctions .",

The park was originally developed in the 1930s as a job creation project to provide a recreational reservoir . However the dam was repeatedly damaged by floods and was removed in 1995 . Along with the dam , crews from the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) and Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) built several structures in the National Park Service rustic style . In a unique twist on the mandate to harmonize with the local environment , the buildings were designed to reflect the ethnic German heritage of New Ulm . The WPA barracks were reused during World War II as Camp New Ulm , housing German prisoners of war . All of these structures are listed as a district on the National Register of Historic Places .",
  "/wiki/New_Deal": "The New Deal was a series of programs , public work projects , financial reforms , and regulations enacted by President Franklin D.

Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964 .",
  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

However , many elements of what is typically termed Victorian architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria 's reign .

Within this naming and classification scheme , it followed Georgian architecture and later Regency architecture , and was succeeded by Edwardian architecture .",

With an estimated size of approximately 44 million in 2016 , German Americans are the largest of the self-reported ancestry groups by the US Census Bureau in its American Community Survey . German-Americans account for about one third of the total ethnic German population in the world . None of the German states had American colonies . In the 1670s , the first significant groups of German immigrants arrived in the British colonies , settling primarily in Pennsylvania , New York , and Virginia . Immigration continued in very large numbers during the 19th century , with eight million arrivals from Germany . Between 1820 and 1870 more than seven and a half million German immigrants came to the United States . By 2010 , their population grew to 49.8 million German Americans , reflecting a jump of six million people since 2000 . There is a German belt that extends all the way across the United States , from eastern Pennsylvania to the Oregon coast .

  "/wiki/Dakota_War_of_1862": "The Dakota War of 1862 , also known as the Sioux Uprising , the Dakota Uprising , the Sioux Outbreak of 1862 , the Dakota Conflict , the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862 or Little Crow 's War , was an armed conflict between the United States and several bands of Dakota ( also known as the eastern 'Sioux ' ) . It began on August 17 , 1862 , along the Minnesota River in southwest Minnesota , four years after its admission as a state . Throughout the late 1850s in the lead-up to the war , treaty violations by the United States and late or unfair annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota . During the war , the Dakota made extensive attacks on hundreds of settlers and immigrants , which resulted in settler deaths , and caused many to flee the area . Intense desire for immediate revenge ended with soldiers capturing hundreds of Dakota men and interning their families . A military tribunal quickly tried the men , sentencing 303 to death for their crimes . President Lincoln would later commute the sentence of 264 of them . The mass hanging of 38 Dakota men was conducted on December 26 , 1862 , in Mankato , Minnesota ; it was the largest mass execution in United States history . Traders with the Dakota previously had demanded that the government give the annuity payments directly to them ( introducing the possibility of unfair dealing between the agents and the traders to the exclusion of the Dakota ) . In mid-1862 , the Dakota demanded the annuities directly from their agent , Thomas J. Galbraith . The traders refused to provide any more supplies on credit under those conditions , and negotiations reached an impasse . On August 17 , 1862 , one young Dakota with a hunting party of three others killed five settlers while on a hunting expedition .",

  "/wiki/Unitarianism": "Unitarianism ( from Latin unitas unity , oneness , from unus one ) is a Christian theological movement named for its belief that the God in Christianity is one person , as opposed to the Trinity ( tri- from Latin tres three ) which in most other branches of Christianity defines God as one being in three persons : the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . Unitarian Christians , therefore , believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings , and he is a savior , but he was not a deity or God incarnate . As is typical of dissenters , Unitarianism does not constitute one single Christian denomination , but rather refers to a collection of both existing and extinct Christian groups , whether historically related to each other or not , which share a common theological concept of the oneness nature of God . While the uncompromising theological monotheism at the heart of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major Christian denominations which subscribe to Trinitarian theology , Christian Unitarianism is closer to the monotheistic understandings of God in Judaism , as well as the concept of the oneness of God in Islam . More so , Muslims believe that Christian Unitarianism encompasses the one true monotheistic divine message from God , perpetuated through the Abrahamic faiths that predated Islam . Unitarianism is also known for the rejection of several other Western Christian doctrines , including the doctrines of original sin , predestination , and the infallibility of the Bible . Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell , but few do today . Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism , depending on one 's stance or viewpoint , and some exclude it from that term due to its rejection of the Trinity . Despite common origins during the Protestant Reformation , some scholars call it a part of Nontrinitarianism , while others consider it both Protestant and Nontrinitarian , seeing no contradiction between those two terms . None of the three views is universally accepted . The Unitarian movement is tied to the more radical critiques of the Reformation . First organized in Eastern Europe during the Reformation , Unitarian communities have developed in Britain , South Africa , India , Canada , the United States , Jamaica , Nigeria , and Japan .",

Janson had previously founded the Free Christian Church of Minneapolis , later known as the Nazareth Church . The organizers of the church in Hanska asked Janson to be their minister , and he came to the area and established the church in January 1882 . By the fall of 1882 , the congregation had raised enough money to build a church . It was built the next spring and hosted its first service on July 8 , 1883 . The next week 's service on July 15 would be the last , because the building was demolished by a tornado on July 21 . Some critics said it was God 's punishment for a group of dissenters .",

Local militias were formed from the earliest English colonization of the Americas in 1607 . The first colony-wide militia was formed by Massachusetts in 1636 by merging small older local units , and several National Guard units can be traced back to this militia . The various colonial militias became state militias when the United States became independent . The title National Guard was used in 1824 by some New York State militia units , named after the French National Guard in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette ."
