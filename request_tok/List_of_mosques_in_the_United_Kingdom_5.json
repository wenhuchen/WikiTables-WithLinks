  "/wiki/Bradford": "Bradford /\u02c8br\u00e6df\u0259rd/ ( listen ) is a city in West Yorkshire , England , in the foothills of the Pennines , 8.6 miles ( 14 km ) west of Leeds , and 16 miles ( 26 km ) north-west of Wakefield . Bradford became a municipal borough in 1847 , and received its charter as a city in 1897 .

Bradford forms part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area , which in 2001 had a population of 1.5 million and is the fourth largest in the United Kingdom . Bradford itself has a population of 529,870 , which makes it the seventh-largest city in the United Kingdom and the third-largest city in Yorkshire and the Humber after Leeds and Sheffield . Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire , Bradford rose to prominence in the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture , particularly wool . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and amongst the earliest industrialised settlements , rapidly becoming the wool capital of the world . The area 's access to a supply of coal , iron ore and soft water facilitated the growth of Bradford 's manufacturing base , which , as textile manufacture grew , led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment ; Bradford has a large amount of listed Victorian architecture including the grand Italianate City Hall . The textile sector in Bradford fell into decline from the mid-20th century . Bradford has since emerged as a tourist destination , becoming the first UNESCO City of Film with attractions such as the National Science and Media Museum , Bradford City Park , the Alhambra theatre and Cartwright Hall .

  "/wiki/Sunni_Muslim": "Sunni Islam ( /\u02c8su\u02d0ni , \u02c8s\u028ani/ ) is the largest denomination of Islam , followed by 87-90% of the world 's Muslims . Its name comes from the word sunnah , referring to the behaviour of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and subsequently acquired broader political significance , as well as theological and juridical dimensions . According to Sunni traditions , Muhammad did not clearly designate a successor and the Muslim community acted according to his sunnah in electing his father-in-law Abu Bakr as the first caliph . This contrasts with the Shia view , which holds that Muhammad announced his son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor , most notably at Ghadir Khumm . Political tensions between Sunnis and Shias continued with varying intensity throughout Islamic history and have been exacerbated in recent times by ethnic conflicts and the rise of Wahhabism . The adherents of Sunni Islam are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jam\u0101\u02bbah ( the people of the sunnah and the community ) or ahl as-sunnah for short . In English , its doctrines and practices are sometimes called Sunnism , while adherents are known as Sunni Muslims , Sunnis , Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah . Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as orthodox Islam , though some scholars view this translation as inappropriate . The Quran , together with hadith ( especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah ) and binding juristic consensus , form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam . Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources , in conjunction with analogical reasoning , consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion , using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools . In matters of creed , the Sunni tradition upholds the six pillars of iman ( faith ) and comprises the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools of rationalistic theology as well as the textualist school known as traditionalist theology .",
