  "/wiki/United_Nations": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security , develop friendly relations among nations , achieve international cooperation , and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations . It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",

  "/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease": "Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , also known as coronary heart disease ( CHD ) or ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) , involves the reduction of blood flow to the heart muscle due to build-up of plaque in the arteries of the heart . It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases . Types include stable angina , unstable angina , myocardial infarction , and sudden cardiac death . A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder , arm , back , neck , or jaw . Occasionally it may feel like heartburn . Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress , last less than a few minutes , and improve with rest . Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present . In many cases , the first sign is a heart attack . Other complications include heart failure or an abnormal heartbeat . Risk factors include high blood pressure , smoking , diabetes , lack of exercise , obesity , high blood cholesterol , poor diet , depression , and excessive alcohol . A number of tests may help with diagnoses including : electrocardiogram , cardiac stress testing , coronary computed tomographic angiography , and coronary angiogram , among others . Ways to reduce CAD risk include eating a healthy diet , regularly exercising , maintaining a healthy weight , and not smoking .",
  "/wiki/Traffic_collision": "A traffic collision , also called a motor vehicle collision ( MVC ) among other terms , occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle , pedestrian , animal , road debris , or other stationary obstruction , such as a tree , pole or building . Traffic collisions often result in injury , death , and property damage . A number of factors contribute to the risk of collisions , including vehicle design , speed of operation , road design , road environment , driving skills , impairment due to alcohol or drugs , and behavior , notably distracted driving , speeding and street racing . Worldwide , motor vehicle collisions lead to death and disability as well as financial costs to both society and the individuals involved . In 2013 , 54 million people worldwide sustained injuries from traffic collisions . This resulted in 1.4 million deaths in 2013 , up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990 . About 68,000 of these occurred in children less than five years old . Almost all high-income countries have decreasing death rates , while the majority of low-income countries have increasing death rates due to traffic collisions . Middle-income countries have the highest rate with 20 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants , accounting for 80% of all road fatalities with 52% of all vehicles . While the death rate in Africa is the highest ( 24.1 per 100,000 inhabitants ) , the lowest rate is to be found in Europe ( 10.3 per 100,000 inhabitants ) .",
  "/wiki/Stroke": "A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death . There are two main types of stroke : ischemic , due to lack of blood flow , and hemorrhagic , due to bleeding . Both result in parts of the brain not functioning properly . Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body , problems understanding or speaking , dizziness , or loss of vision to one side . Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred . If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) or mini-stroke . A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache . The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent . Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control . The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure . Other risk factors include tobacco smoking , obesity , high blood cholesterol , diabetes mellitus , a previous TIA , and atrial fibrillation . An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel , though there are also less common causes .",
  "/wiki/ICD-10_Chapter_XVI:_Certain_conditions_originating_in_the_perinatal_period": "ICD-10 is an international statistical classification used in health care and related industries . Produced by the World Health Organization , it is used in several countries around the world . Some have gone on to develop their own national enhancements , building off the international version of the classification . Chapter XVI of ICD-10 deals with conditions effecting the perinatal period . Examples of conditions captured using codes from Chapter XVI include ; birth injuries , prematurity , neonatal jaundice , and neonatal withdrawal . For coding and reporting purposes the perinatal period is defined as before birth through the 28th day following birth .",
  "/wiki/Hypertension": "Hypertension ( HTN or HT ) , also known as high blood pressure ( HBP ) , is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated . High blood pressure typically does not cause symptoms . Long-term high blood pressure , however , is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease , stroke , heart failure , atrial fibrillation , peripheral arterial disease , vision loss , chronic kidney disease , and dementia . High blood pressure is classified as primary ( essential ) hypertension or secondary hypertension . About 90-95% of cases are primary , defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors . Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet , excess body weight , smoking , and alcohol use . The remaining 5-10% of cases are categorized as secondary high blood pressure , defined as high blood pressure due to an identifiable cause , such as chronic kidney disease , narrowing of the kidney arteries , an endocrine disorder , or the use of birth control pills . Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements , the systolic and diastolic pressures , which are the maximum and minimum pressures , respectively . For most adults , normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100-130 millimeters mercury ( mmHg ) systolic and 60-80 mmHg diastolic . For most adults , high blood pressure is present if the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 130/80 or 140/90 mmHg . Different numbers apply to children . Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office-based blood pressure measurement .",
  "/wiki/Stomach_cancer": "Stomach cancer , also known as gastric cancer , is a cancer that develops from the lining of the stomach . Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas , which can be divided into a number of subtypes including gastric adenocarcinomas . Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach . Early symptoms may include heartburn , upper abdominal pain , nausea and loss of appetite . Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss , yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes , vomiting , difficulty swallowing and blood in the stool among others . The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body , particularly the liver , lungs , bones , lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes . The most common cause is infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori , which accounts for more than 60% of cases . Certain types of H. pylori have greater risks than others . Smoking , dietary factors such as pickled vegetables and obesity are other risk factors . About 10% of cases run in families , and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person 's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer . Most of the time , stomach cancer develops in stages over years . Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy .",
  "/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term breathing problems and poor airflow . The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production . COPD is a progressive disease , meaning it typically worsens over time . Eventually , everyday activities such as walking or getting dressed become difficult . Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD . The term chronic bronchitis is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years . Those with such a cough are at a greater risk of developing COPD . The term emphysema is also used for the abnormal presence of air or other gas within tissues . Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD , with factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role . In the developing world , one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires . Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs , resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue . The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests .",
  "/wiki/Diarrhea": "Diarrhea , also spelled diarrhoea , is the condition of having at least three loose , liquid , or watery bowel movements each day . It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss . Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour . This can progress to decreased urination , loss of skin color , a fast heart rate , and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe . Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed , however , are normal . The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus , bacteria , or parasite - a condition also known as gastroenteritis . These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces , or directly from another person who is infected . The three types of diarrhea are : short duration watery diarrhea , short duration bloody diarrhea , and persistent diarrhea ( lasting more than two weeks , which can be either watery or bloody ) . The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to cholera , although this is rare in the developed world . If blood is present , it is also known as dysentery . A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea . These include lactose intolerance , irritable bowel syndrome , non-celiac gluten sensitivity , celiac disease , inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis , hyperthyroidism , bile acid diarrhea , and a number of medications .",
  "/wiki/Inflammatory_heart_disease": "Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels . CVD includes coronary artery diseases ( CAD ) such as angina and myocardial infarction ( commonly known as a heart attack ) . Other CVDs include stroke , heart failure , hypertensive heart disease , rheumatic heart disease , cardiomyopathy , abnormal heart rhythms , congenital heart disease , valvular heart disease , carditis , aortic aneurysms , peripheral artery disease , thromboembolic disease , and venous thrombosis . The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease . Coronary artery disease , stroke , and peripheral artery disease involve atherosclerosis . This may be caused by high blood pressure , smoking , diabetes mellitus , lack of exercise , obesity , high blood cholesterol , poor diet , and excessive alcohol consumption , among others . High blood pressure is estimated to account for approximately 13% of CVD deaths , while tobacco accounts for 9% , diabetes 6% , lack of exercise 6% and obesity 5% . Rheumatic heart disease may follow untreated strep throat . It is estimated that up to 90% of CVD may be preventable . Prevention of CVD involves improving risk factors through : healthy eating , exercise , avoidance of tobacco smoke and limiting alcohol intake . Treating risk factors , such as high blood pressure , blood lipids and diabetes is also beneficial . Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics can decrease the risk of rheumatic heart disease .",
  "/wiki/Lower_respiratory_tract_infection": "Lower respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) is a term often used as a synonym for pneumonia , but can also be applied to other types of infection including lung abscess and acute bronchitis . Symptoms include shortness of breath , weakness , fever , coughing and fatigue . A routine chest x-ray is not always necessary for people who have symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection . Influenza affects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts . [ citation needed ] Antibiotics are the first line treatment for pneumonia ; however , they are neither effective nor indicated for parasitic or viral infections . Acute bronchitis typically resolves on its own with time . In 2015 there were about 291 million cases . These resulted in 2.74 million deaths down from 3.4 million deaths in 1990 . This was 4.8% of all deaths in 2013 .",
  "/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate": "The following is a list of the causes of human deaths worldwide for the year 2002 , arranged by their associated mortality rates . There were 57,029,000 deaths tabulated for that year . Some causes listed include deaths also included in more specific subordinate causes ( as indicated by the Group column ) , and some causes are omitted , so the percentages do not sum to 100 . According to the World Health Organization , about 58 million people died in 2005 , using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ( ICD ) . According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation , 52.77 million people died in 2010 . The causes listed are relatively immediate medical causes , but the ultimate cause of death might be described differently . For example , tobacco smoking can cause lung disease or cancer , and alcohol abuse can cause liver failure or a motor vehicle accident . For statistics on preventable ultimate causes see Preventable causes of death .",

  "/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population": "A city proper is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognised urban status that is usually characterised by some form of local government . In some cases , cities proper may not include suburbs or even parts of the urban core whereas in other cases the boundaries may include non-contiguous urban settlements or even rural areas . World Urbanization Prospects , a UN publication , defines the population of the city proper as the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city or controlled directly from the city by a single authority . The book continues to say that city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives . The UN also employs two alternative definitions of cities that use arbitrarily defined boundaries ( urban area and metropolitan area ) since no single definition for a city can be applied to compare every settlement . Using the administrative definition , many cities will be smaller than their urban areas such as Sydney , Australia . In contrast , many Chinese cities govern territories that extend well beyond the traditional city proper into suburban and rural areas .",

With a population of around 8.7 million in the city and 15 million in the larger metropolitan area of Greater Tehran , Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western Asia , and has the second-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East ( after Cairo ) . It is ranked 24th in the world by the population of its metropolitan area . In the Classical era , part of the territory of present-day Tehran was occupied by Rhages , a prominent Median city . It was subject to destruction through the medieval Arab , Turkic , and Mongol invasions . Its modern-day inheritor remains as an urban area absorbed into the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran . Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in 1786 , in order to remain within close reach of Iran 's territories in the Caucasus , before being separated from Iran as a result of the Russo-Iranian Wars , and to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties . The capital has been moved several times throughout history , and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Iran . Large-scale demolition and rebuilding began in the 1920s , and Tehran has been a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century . Tehran is home to many historical collections , including the royal complexes of Golestan , Sa'dabad , and Niavaran , where the two last dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated . Tehran 's most famous landmarks include the Azadi Tower , a memorial built under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran , and the Milad Tower , the world 's sixth-tallest self-supporting tower which was completed in 2007 . The Tabiat Bridge , a newly built landmark , was completed in 2014 .",

  "/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate": "The under-five mortality rate is the number of deaths of infants and children under five years old per 1000 live births . The under-five mortality rate for the world is 40.8 deaths according to the World Bank and the World Health Organization . 5.6 million children under age five died in 2016 , 15 000 every day . The infant mortality rate ( IMR ) figures are from the United Nations World Population Prospects report , by five years averages , and the CIA World Factbook . The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of infants under one year old per 1,000 live births . This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of health in a country . The infant mortality rate of the world is 49.4 according to the United Nations and 34.1 according to the CIA World Factbook . Note that due to differences in reporting , these numbers may not be comparable across countries . The WHO recommendation is that all children who show signs of life should be recorded as live births . In many countries this standard is not followed , artificially lowering their infant mortality rates relative to countries which follow those standards . Note : The tables can be variously sorted using the icon .",
  "/wiki/Infant_mortality_rate": "Infant mortality is the death of young children under the age of 1 . This death toll is measured by the infant mortality rate ( IMR ) , which is the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1000 live births . The under-five mortality rate , which is referred to as the child mortality rate , is also an important statistic , considering the infant mortality rate focuses only on children under one year of age . Premature birth is the biggest contributor to the IMR . Other leading causes of infant mortality are birth asphyxia , pneumonia , congenital malformations , term birth complications such as abnormal presentation of the foetus umbilical cord prolapse , or prolonged labor , neonatal infection , diarrhoea , malaria , measles and malnutrition . One of the most common preventable causes of infant mortality is smoking during pregnancy . Many factors contribute to infant mortality , such as the mother 's level of education , environmental conditions , and political and medical infrastructure . Improving sanitation , access to clean drinking water , immunization against infectious diseases , and other public health measures can help reduce high rates of infant mortality . In 1990 9 million infants younger than 1 year died globally . Until 2015 this number has almost halved to 4.6 million infant deaths . Over the same period , the infant mortality rate declined from 65 deaths per 1,000 live births to 29 deaths per 1,000 . Child mortality is the death of a child before the child 's fifth birthday , measured as the under-5 child mortality rate ( U5MR ) .",
  "/wiki/Maternal_death": "Maternal death or maternal mortality is defined by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy , irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy , from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes . Adding to the WHO definition , the CDC extends the period of consideration to include up to 1 year within the end of a pregnancy regardless of the outcome . There are two performance indicators that are sometimes used interchangeably : maternal mortality ratio and maternal mortality rate , which confusingly both are abbreviated MMR . By 2017 , the world maternal mortality rate had declined 44% since 1990 , but still every day 830 women die from pregnancy or childbirth related causes . According to the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) 2017 report , this is equivalent to about one woman every two minutes and for every woman who dies , 20 or 30 encounter complications with serious or long-lasting consequences . Most of these deaths and injuries are entirely preventable . UNFPA estimated that 303,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2015 . These causes range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour , for which there are highly effective interventions . As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency obstetric care , the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 385 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 216 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015 , and many countries halved their maternal death rates in the last 10 years . Although attempts have been made in reducing maternal mortality , there is much room for improvement , particularly in impoverished regions . Over 85% of maternal deaths are from impoverished communities in Africa and Asia . The effect of a mother 's death results in vulnerable families .",

  "/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_future_population": "All the figures shown here have been sourced from the International Data Base ( IDB ) Division of the United States Census Bureau . Every individual value has been rounded to the nearest thousand , to assure data coherence , particularly when adding up ( sub ) totals . Although data from specific statistical offices may be more accurate , the information provided here has the advantage of being homogeneous . Population estimates , as long as they are based on recent censuses , can be more easily projected into the near future than many macroeconomic indicators , such as GDP , which are much more sensitive to political and/or economic crises . This means that demographic estimates for the next five ( or even ten ) years can be more accurate than the projected evolution of GDP over the same time period ( which may also be distorted by inflation ) . However , no projected population figures can be considered exact . As the IDB states , figures beyond the years 2020-2025 should be taken with caution , as the census way towards those years has yet to be paved . Thus projections can be said to be looking through a kind of cloudy glass or a misty window : realistically , the projections are guesstimates . To make things complicated , not all countries carry out censuses regularly , especially some of the poorer , faster-growing sub-Saharan African nations ( whose evolution may be more interesting , from a demographer 's point of view , than the stagnated populations of countries like Germany or Italy ) . As is well known from the statistics , the population of many sub-Saharan nations , as well as other nations like Algeria , Bangladesh , Egypt and Pakistan , with their low family planning , are growing much faster than in the aging European nations or Japan . In general , although population growth in the former countries may slow in the future , it is unlikely that it will have stabilized by 2050 , as predicted by the IDB data in some cases ; they may also stay near the relatively high average level of 1.5% increase per year . Something similar can be said about China , whose population is still growing at an absolute rate of some 10 million per year , despite its government 's efforts to stabilize it through its one child per couple policy .",
