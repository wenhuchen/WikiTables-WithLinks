  "/wiki/Scientific_name": "Binomial nomenclature ( two-term naming system ) , also called binominal nomenclature ( two-name naming system ) or binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts , both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages . Such a name is called a binomial name ( which may be shortened to just binomial ) , a binomen , binominal name or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name - the generic name - identifies the genus to which the species belongs , while the second part - the specific name or specific epithet - identifies the species within the genus . For example , humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . Tyrannosaurus rex is probably the most widely known binomial . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753 . But Gaspard Bauhin , in as early as 1622 , had introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici ( English , Illustrated exposition of plants ) many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus . The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules , of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICNafp ) . Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes , there are some differences , both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules . In modern usage , the first letter of the first part of the name , the genus , is always capitalized in writing , while that of the second part is not , even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place . Similarly , both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text ( or underlined in handwriting ) . Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox ( named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii .",
  "/wiki/Common_name": "In biology , a common name of a taxon or organism ; also known as a vernacular name ( local name ) , English name , colloquial name , trivial name , trivial epithet , country name , popular name , or farmer 's name ; is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life ; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism , which is Latinized . A common name is sometimes frequently used , but that is by no means always the case . Sometimes common names are created by authorities on one particular subject , in an attempt to make it possible for members of the general public ( including such interested parties as fishermen , farmers , etc . ) to be able to refer to one particular species of organism without needing to be able to memorise or pronounce the Latinized scientific name . Creating an official list of common names can also be an attempt to standardize the use of common names , which can sometimes vary a great deal between one part of a country and another , as well as between one country and another country , even where the same language is spoken in both places .",

  "/wiki/Acerodon_jubatus": "The giant golden-crowned flying fox ( Acerodon jubatus ) , also known as the golden-capped fruit bat , is a species of megabat endemic to the Philippines . Since its description in 1831 , three subspecies of the giant golden-crowned flying fox have been recognized , one of which is extinct . The extinct subspecies ( A. jubatus lucifer ) was formerly recognized as a full species , the Panay golden-crowned flying fox . Formerly , this species was placed in the genus Pteropus ; while it is no longer within the genus , it has many physical similarities to Pteropus megabats . It is one of the largest bat species in the world , weighing up to 1.4 kg ( 3.1 lb ) - only the Indian and great flying fox can weigh more . It has the longest documented forearm length of any bat species at 215 mm ( 8.5 in ) . It is primarily frugivorous , consuming several kinds of fig . However , its diet also includes some leaves . It forages at night and sleeps during the day in tree roosts . These roosts can consist of thousands of individuals , often including another species , the large flying fox . Not much is known about its reproduction ; it gives birth annually from April through June , with females having one pup at a time . Predators of the giant golden-crowned flying fox include raptors such as eagles , the reticulated python , and humans .",
  "/wiki/Chiroptera": "Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera ; [ a ] with their forelimbs adapted as wings , they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight . Bats are more manoeuvrable than birds , flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium . The smallest bat , and arguably the smallest extant mammal , is Kitti 's hog-nosed bat , which is 29-34 mm ( 1.14-1.34 in ) in length , 15 cm ( 5.91 in ) across the wings and 2-2.6 g ( 0.07-0.09 oz ) in mass . The largest bats are the flying foxes and the giant golden-crowned flying fox , Acerodon jubatus , which can weigh 1.6 kg ( 4 lb ) and have a wingspan of 1.7 m ( 5 ft 7 in ) . The second largest order of mammals after rodents , bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide , with over 1,200 species . These were traditionally divided into two suborders : the largely fruit-eating megabats , and the echolocating microbats . But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera , with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats . Many bats are insectivores , and most of the rest are frugivores ( fruit-eaters ) . A few species feed on animals other than insects ; for example , the vampire bats feed on blood . Most bats are nocturnal , and many roost in caves or other refuges ; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators . Bats are present throughout the world , with the exception of extremely cold regions . They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds ; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services .",

  "/wiki/Scleractinia": "Scleractinia , also called stony corals or hard corals , are marine animals in the phylum Cnidaria that build themselves a hard skeleton . The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc in which a mouth is fringed with tentacles . Although some species are solitary , most are colonial . The founding polyp settles and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body . Solitary corals can be as much as 25 cm ( 10 in ) across but in colonial species the polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter . These polyps reproduce asexually by budding , but remain attached to each other , forming a multi-polyp colony of clones with a common skeleton , which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species . The shape and appearance of each coral colony depends not only on the species , but also on its location , depth , the amount of water movement and other factors . Many shallow-water corals contain symbiont unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues . These give their colour to the coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of symbiont it contains . Stony corals are closely related to sea anemones , and like them are armed with stinging cells known as cnidocytes . Corals reproduce both sexually and asexually . Most species release gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place , and the planula larvae drift as part of the plankton , but a few species brood their eggs .",

It inhabits most oceans and adjoining seas , and prefers deep offshore waters . It avoids polar and tropical waters and semienclosed bodies of water . The sei whale migrates annually from cool , subpolar waters in summer to temperate , subtropical waters in winter with a lifespan of 70 years . Reaching 19.5 m ( 64 ft ) long and weighing as much as 28 t ( 28 long tons ; 31 short tons ) , the sei whale consumes an average of 900 kg ( 2,000 lb ) of food every day ; its diet consists primarily of copepods , krill , and other zooplankton . It is among the fastest of all cetaceans , and can reach speeds of up to 50 km/h ( 31 mph ) ( 27 knots ) over short distances . The whale 's name comes from the Norwegian word for pollock , a fish that appears off the coast of Norway at the same time of the year as the sei whale . Following large-scale commercial whaling during the late 19th and 20th centuries , when over 255,000 whales were killed , the sei whale is now internationally protected , although limited hunting occurs under a controversial research program conducted by Japan . As of 2008 [ update ] , its worldwide population was about 80,000 , less than a third of its prewhaling population .",

The blue whales long and slender body can be various shades of grayish-blue dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath . There are currently five subspecies of blue whale , recognized by the Society for Marine Mammalogy 's Committee on Taxonomy : B. m. musculus in the North Atlantic and North Pacific , B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean , B. m. brevicauda ( the pygmy blue whale ) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean , B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean , and B. m. unnamed subsp . in the waters off Chile . The blue whale diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids ( krill ) . Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the end of the 19th century . They were hunted almost to extinction by whaling until the International Whaling Commission banned all hunting of blue whales in 1967 . The International Whaling Commission catch database estimates that 382,595 blue whales were caught between 1868 and 1978 . The global blue whale population abundance is estimated to be 10,000-25,000 blue whales , roughly 3-11% of the population size estimated in 1911 .

About 40% of all mammal species are rodents ( 2,277 species ) ; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica . They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats , including human-made environments . Species can be arboreal , fossorial ( burrowing ) , or semiaquatic . Well-known rodents include mice , rats , squirrels , prairie dogs , chipmunks , chinchillas , porcupines , beavers , guinea pigs , hamsters , gerbils and capybaras . Rabbits , hares , and pikas , whose incisors also grow continually , were once included with them , but are now considered to be in a separate order , the Lagomorpha . Nonetheless , Rodentia and Lagomorpha are sister groups , sharing a single common ancestor and forming the clade of Glires . Most rodents are small animals with robust bodies , short limbs , and long tails . They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food , excavate burrows , and defend themselves . Most eat seeds or other plant material , but some have more varied diets . They tend to be social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other . Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy , to polygyny , to promiscuity .",

Members of the order are distinguished by their skins , which bear horny scales or shields . They also possess movable quadrate bones , making it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the neurocranium . This is particularly visible in snakes , which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey . Squamata is the most variably sized order of reptiles , ranging from the 16 mm ( 0.63 in ) dwarf gecko ( Sphaerodactylus ariasae ) to the 5.21 m ( 17.1 ft ) green anaconda ( Eunectes murinus ) and the now-extinct mosasaurs , which reached lengths of over 14 m ( 46 ft ) .

The Sulu Archipelago islands are within the Mindanao island group , consisting of the provinces of Basilan , Sulu , and Tawi-Tawi . The archipelago is not , as is often supposed , the remains of a land bridge between Borneo and the Philippines . Rather , it is the exposed edge of small submarine ridges produced by tectonic tilting of the sea bottom . Basilan , Jolo , Tawitawi and other islands in the group are extinct volcanic cones rising from the southernmost ridge . Tawi-Tawi , the southernmost island of the group , has a serpentine basement-complex core with a limestone covering . This island chain is an important migration route for birds . The largest municipalities in the area are on Maimbung and Jolo . The larger island of Palawan to its north , the coastal regions of the westward-extending Zamboanga Peninsula of Mindanao , and the north-eastern part of the island of Borneo were formerly parts of the thalassocratic Sultanate of Sulu .

The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately 135 kg ( 298 lb ) , with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450 kg ( 1,000 lb ) . The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color , and the shell is typically reddish brown . No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult , the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons ( lower shells ) than the females . The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian Oceans , as well as the Mediterranean Sea . It spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats , with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs . The loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate ; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become quiescent , producing no eggs for two to three years . The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17-33 years and has a lifespan of 47-67 years . The loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous , feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates .

The earliest known members of this group date from the Middle Jurassic , making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians . Of the 356 known species alive today , some are highly endangered . Turtles are ectotherms - animals commonly called cold-blooded - meaning that their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment . However , because of their high metabolic rate , leatherback sea turtles have a body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water . Turtles are classified as amniotes , along with other reptiles , birds , and mammals . Like other amniotes , turtles breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater , although many species live in or around water .",

It was created in 1641 , when an earthquake caused a side of Mount Asog to collapse . The resulting landslide created a natural dam that blocked the flow of nearby streams . Another theory suggests that it was created by the eruption of Mt . Asog , which is now dormant . The lake is famous since it is one of the few bodies of water that contains the sinarapan ( Mistichthys luzonensis ) which is the world 's smallest commercially harvested fish .

  "/wiki/Soricomorpha": "Soricomorpha ( from Greek shrew-form ) is a formerly used taxon within the class of mammals . In the past it formed a significant group within the former order Insectivora . However , Insectivora was shown to be polyphyletic and various new orders were split off from it , including Afrosoricida ( tenrecs and golden moles ) , Macroscelidea ( elephant shrews ) , and Erinaceomorpha ( hedgehogs and gymnures ) , with the four remaining extant and recent families of Soricomorpha shown here then being treated as a separate order . Insectivora was left empty and disbanded . Subsequently , Soricomorpha itself was shown to be paraphyletic , because Soricidae shared a more recent common ancestor with Erinaceidae than with other soricomorphs . The combination of Soricomorpha and Erinaceidae , referred to as order Eulipotyphla , has been shown to be monophyletic . Living members of the group range in size from the Etruscan shrew , at about 3.5 cm and 2 grams , to the Cuban solenodon , at about 32 cm and 1 kg .",
