  "/wiki/Deinococcus": "Deinococcus ( from the Greek : \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 , deinos , dreadful , strange and \u03ba\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 , k\u00f3kkos , granule ) is one genus of three in the order Deinococcales of the bacterial phylum Deinococcus-Thermus highly resistant to environmental hazards . These bacteria have thick cell walls that give them Gram-positive stains , but they include a second membrane and so are closer in structure to Gram-negative bacteria . Deinococcus survive when their DNA is exposed to high doses of gamma and UV radiation . Whereas other bacteria change their structure in the presence of radiation , such as by forming endospores , Deinococcus tolerate it without changing their cellular form and do not retreat into a hardened structure . They are also characterized by the presence of the carotenoid pigment deinoxanthin that give them their pink color . They are usually isolated according to these two criteria .",
  "/wiki/Deinococcus_deserti": "Deinococcus deserti is a Gram-negative , rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Deinococcaceae , a group of extremely radiotolerant bacteria . D. deserti and other Deinococcaceae exhibit an extraordinary ability to withstand ionizing radiation .",
  "/wiki/Deinococcales": "Deinococcus-Thermus is a phylum of bacteria that are highly resistant to environmental hazards , also known as extremophiles . These bacteria have thick cell walls that give them gram-positive stains , but they include a second membrane and so are closer in structure to those of gram-negative bacteria . Cavalier-Smith calls this clade Hadobacteria ( from Hades , the Greek underworld ) .",
  "/wiki/Deinococcus_geothermalis": "Deinococcus geothermalis is a bacterium . It produces orange-pigmented colonies and has an optimum growth temperature of about 45 \u00b0C ( 113 \u00b0F ) to 50 \u00b0C ( 122 \u00b0F ) . It is extremely gamma radiation-resistant . Its type strain is AG-3a ( = DSM 11300 ) . A space mission called EXPOSE-R2 was launched on 24 July 2014 aboard the Russian Progress M-23M , and was attached on 18 August 2014 outside the ISS on the Russian module Zvezda . The two main experiments will test the resistance of a variety of extremophile microorganisms , including Deinococcus geothermalis to long-term exposure to outer space and to a Mars simulated environment .",
  "/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans": "Deinococcus radiodurans is an extremophilic bacterium , one of the most radiation-resistant organisms known . It can survive cold , dehydration , vacuum , and acid , and is therefore known as a polyextremophile and has been listed as the world 's toughest bacterium in The Guinness Book Of World Records .",

  "/wiki/Thermus_thermophilus": "Thermus thermophilus is a Gram negative bacterium used in a range of biotechnological applications , including as a model organism for genetic manipulation , structural genomics , and systems biology . The bacterium is extremely thermophilic , with an optimal growth temperature of about 65 \u00b0C ( 149 \u00b0F ) . Thermus thermophilus was originally isolated from a thermal vent within a hot spring in Izu , Japan by Tairo Oshima and Kazutomo Imahori . The organism has also been found to be important in the degradation of organic materials in the thermogenic phase of composting . T. thermophilus is classified into several strains , of which HB8 and HB27 are the most commonly used in laboratory environments . Genome analyses of these strains were independently completed in 2004 .",
