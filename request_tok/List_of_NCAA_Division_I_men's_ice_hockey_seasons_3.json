  "/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)": "In ice hockey , a forward is a player position on the ice whose primary responsibility is to score and assist goals . Generally , the forwards try to stay in three different lanes , also known as thirds , of the ice going from goal to goal . It is not mandatory , however , to stay in a lane . Staying in a lane aids in forming the common offensive strategy known as a triangle . One forward obtains the puck and then the forwards pass it between themselves making the goalie move side to side . This strategy opens up the net for scoring opportunities . This strategy allows for a constant flow of the play , attempting to maintain the control of play by one team in the offensive zone . The forwards can pass to the defence players playing at the blue line , thus freeing up the play and allowing either a shot from the point ( blue line position where the defence stands ) or a pass back to the offence . This then begins the triangle again . Each team has three forwards in each line :",

  "/wiki/1947\u201348_NCAA_men's_ice_hockey_season": "The 1947-48 NCAA men 's ice hockey season began in November 1947 and concluded with the 1948 NCAA Men 's Ice Hockey Tournament 's championship game on March 20 , 1948 at the Broadmoor Ice Palace in Colorado Springs , Colorado . This was the 1st season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held and is the 53rd year overall where an NCAA school fielded a team . In 1947 there were quasi-official guidelines separating major and minor football programs across the NCAA , but no such determinations had been made for ice hockey teams . Even among the universities that played ice hockey , no such distinctions were even attempted until the mid-1960s . As such , all American universities operating a men 's varsity ice hockey program are included here . As this was the first time a national championship was held , it is considered ( unofficially ) the first season of NCAA Division I ice hockey as it is the first time that any college teams would have to conform to NCAA regulations regarding recruitment , scholarship , eligibility , etc . The tournament was , itself , born out of a desire to definitively decide the best collegiate team in the country . With only a handful of universities even playing ice hockey ( indoor ice rinks were fairly expensive to operate ) and even less playing a decent number of games each year only four teams were selected to play in the tournament .",
