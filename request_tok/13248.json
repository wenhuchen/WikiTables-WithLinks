  "/wiki/John_Nicholas_(congressman)": "John Nicholas ( January 19 , 1764 - December 31 , 1819 ) was an American lawyer , farmer , and politician from Williamsburg , Virginia . He represented Virginia in the U.S. House from 1793 to 1801 . In 1798 , before the enactment of the Sedition Act , which made it a crime to publish false , scandalous , and malicious writing against the government or its officials , Nicholas declared the proposed Act to be unconstitutional . The Act was inconsistent with the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment , Nicholas said , because the press could be punished for publishing true statements if it were not possible to prove the truth of the statements , which is often the case . In 1799 , when Republicans in the House proposed to repeal the Sedition Act , a party line vote resulted in the rejection of the proposal . Nicholas wrote a minority report describing the policy goal of the Act as being related to Great Britain 's form of government : The King is hereditary , and according to the theory of their Government , can do no wrong . Public officers are his representatives , and derive some portion of his inviolability . Nicholas distinguished this form of deferential respect for public officers to the level of respect owed to their American counterparts , who serve the people and can be removed from office during elections . In 1803 Nicholas moved to Geneva , New York and started a farm . From 1806 until 1809 he served in the New York State Senate . He died at home , and is buried in the Glenwood Cemetery in Geneva .
