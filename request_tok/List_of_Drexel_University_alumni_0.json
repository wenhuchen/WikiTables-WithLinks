  "/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)": "Black Monday is the name commonly attached to the large stock market crash of October 19 , 1987 . [ A ] In the United States , the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) fell exactly 508 points ( 22.6% ) . This was the largest one-day percentage drop in history . Significant selling created steep price declines throughout the day , particularly during the last hour and a half of trading . The S & P 500 and Wilshire 5000 indices each declined more than 18 percent , and the S & P 500 futures contract declined 29 percent . Total trading volume was so large that the computer and communications systems in place at the time were overwhelmed , leaving orders unfilled for an hour or more . Large funds transfers were delayed for hours and the Fedwire and NYSE DOT systems shut down for extended periods of time , further compounding traders ' confusion . All of the 23 major world markets experienced a similar decline that October . When measured in a common currency ( US dollars ) , 8 of them declined by 20 to 29% , 3 by 30 to 39% ( Malaysia , Mexico and New Zealand ) , and 3 by more than 40% ( Hong Kong , Australia and Singapore ) [ B ] Worldwide losses are estimated at $ 1.7 trillion US dollars . The severity of the crash sparked fears of extended economic instability or even a reprise of the Great Depression . Across nations , the degree to which the financial markets ' distress spread to the wider economy ( the real economy ) was directly related to the monetary policy each nation pursued in response . The central banks of the United States , Germany and Japan provided liquidity to prevent debt defaults among financial institutions , and the impact on the real economy was relatively limited and short-lived .",
  "/wiki/Stock_market": "A stock market , equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers ( a loose network of economic transactions , not a physical facility or discrete entity ) of stocks ( also called shares ) , which represent ownership claims on businesses ; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange , as well as stock that is only traded privately , such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms . Investment in the stock market is most often done via stockbrokerages and electronic trading platforms . Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind .
