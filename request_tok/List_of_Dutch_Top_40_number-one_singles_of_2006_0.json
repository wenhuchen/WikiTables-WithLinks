The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus , who initially believed he had found India or China . Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas , La Navidad , on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti . The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola , forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century . However , competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697 , which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue . French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations , worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa , which made the colony one of the richest in the world . In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789-99 ) , slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution ( 1791-1804 ) , led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture . After 12 years of conflict , Napoleon Bonaparte 's forces were defeated by Louverture 's successor , Jean-Jacques Dessalines ( later Emperor Jacques I ) , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty on 1 January 1804 - the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the first country to abolish slavery , and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt .",

  "/wiki/Green_Day": "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt . For much of the band 's career , they have been a trio with drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool , who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 prior to the recording of the band 's second studio album , Kerplunk ( 1991 ) . Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012 , but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016 . Green Day was originally part of the late 80s-early 90s punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley , California . The band 's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout ! Records . In 1994 , their major label debut Dookie , released through Reprise Records , became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands NOFX , Sublime , Bad Religion , the Offspring , and Rancid with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S . Though the albums Insomniac ( 1995 ) , Nimrod ( 1997 ) , and Warning ( 2000 ) did not match the success of Dookie , they were still successful with the former two reaching triple platinum status while the latter achieved gold . Green Day 's seventh album , a rock opera called American Idiot ( 2004 ) , found popularity with a younger generation , selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album , 21st Century Breakdown , was released in 2009 and achieved the band 's best chart performance . It was followed by a trilogy of albums , \u00a1Uno ! , \u00a1Dos ! , and \u00a1Tr\u00e9 ! , released in September , November , and December 2012 respectively . The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong going into rehab . Their twelfth studio album , Revolution Radio , was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No ."
