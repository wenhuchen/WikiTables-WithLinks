The dynasty was founded by the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria . In the late sixteenth century , Nurhaci , originally a Ming vassal , began organizing Banners , military-social units that included Manchu , Han , and Mongol elements . Nurhaci united Manchu clans and officially proclaimed the Later Jin dynasty in 1616 . His son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of the Liaodong Peninsula and declared a new dynasty , the Qing , in 1636 . As Ming control disintegrated , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the capital , Beijing , in 1644 .

It is sometimes considered as the latter part of a longer period known as the Six Dynasties ( 220 to 589 ) . Though an age of civil war and political chaos , it was also a time of flourishing arts and culture , advancement in technology , and the spread of Mahayana Buddhism and Daoism . The period saw large-scale migration of Han Chinese to the lands south of the Yangtze . The period came to an end with the unification of all of China proper by Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty . During this period , the process of sinicization accelerated among the non-Chinese arrivals in the north and among the indigenous people in the south . This process was also accompanied by the increasing popularity of Buddhism ( introduced into China in the 1st century ) in both northern and southern China and Daoism gaining influence as well , with two essential Daoist canons written during this period . Notable technological advances occurred during this period . The invention of the stirrup during the earlier Jin dynasty ( 265-420 ) helped spur the development of heavy cavalry as a combat standard . Historians also note advances in medicine , astronomy , mathematics , and cartography . Intellectuals of the period include the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi ( 429-500 ) .",

It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant . In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries , the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people . Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people . [ b ] With its large population base , the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road . Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court , while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system .

It followed the Song dynasty and preceded the Ming dynasty . Although the Mongols had ruled territories including modern-day North China for decades , it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style , and the conquest was not complete until 1279 when the Southern Song dynasty was defeated in the Battle of Yamen . His realm was , by this point , isolated from the other Mongol khanates and controlled most of modern-day China and its surrounding areas , including modern Mongolia . It was the first non-Han Chinese dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368 when the Ming dynasty defeated the Yuan forces . Following that , the rebuked Genghisid rulers retreated to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule as the Northern Yuan dynasty .

Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC by ancient Chinese states ; selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang ( 220-206 BC ) , the first Emperor of China . Little of the Qin wall remains . Later on , many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls . The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) . Apart from defense , other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls , allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road , regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration . Furthermore , the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers , troop barracks , garrison stations , signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire , and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor . The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses . Collectively , they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west , from the present-day Sino-Russian border in the north to Taohe River in the south ; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of Mongolian steppe .

The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society . He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms . These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States .

The dynasty was founded by Emperor Taizu of Song following his usurpation of the throne of the Later Zhou , ending the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period . The Song often came into conflict with the contemporaneous Liao , Western Xia and Jin dynasties to its north . It was eventually conquered by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty . The Song government was the first in world history to issue banknotes or true paper money nationally and the first Chinese government to establish a permanent standing navy . This dynasty also saw the first known use of gunpowder , as well as the first discernment of true north using a compass .

Although the Song dynasty had lost control of the traditional birthplace of Chinese civilization along the Yellow River , the Song economy was still strong , as the Southern Song empire contained a large population and productive agricultural land .

Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng ( who established the Shun dynasty , soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty ) , numerous rump regimes loyal to the Ming throne - collectively called the Southern Ming - survived until 1662 . [ d ] The Hongwu Emperor ( r. 1368-1398 ) attempted to create a society of self-sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid , immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty : the empire 's standing army exceeded one million troops and the navy 's dockyards in Nanjing were the largest in the world . He also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates , enfeoffing his many sons throughout China and attempting to guide these princes through the Huang-Ming Zuxun , a set of published dynastic instructions . This failed when his teenage successor , the Jianwen Emperor , attempted to curtail his uncles ' power , prompting the Jingnan Campaign , an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402 . The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it Beijing , constructed the Forbidden City , and restored the Grand Canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments . He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats . One , Zheng He , led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the Indian Ocean as far as Arabia and the eastern coasts of Africa . The rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances ; the capture of the Zhengtong Emperor during the 1449 Tumu Crisis ended them completely . The imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the Liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the Great Wall of China into its modern form .

Longde County is located in the southern part of Ningxia . It gets its name from the town of Long and the Deshun army . Historically , the county was under the control of Pingliang city in Gansu province . It borders the rest of Ningxia , as well as Shaanxi and Gansu provinces . It also connects the important northwestern cities of Xi'an and Lanzhou . To the north of the county is Guyuan , to the east is Pingliang , to the south is Jingyuan County , and to the west is Jingning County . Although Longde County is in the southern part of Ningxia , air temperature is usually lower than the surrounding areas , because Longde is , on average , 2000 meters above sea level . In addition , because the county is located in the northern foothills of the Liupan mountain range , there is relatively little water . The water that is added is commonly lost to earth flows , so agriculture in the county is poorly developed . These factors , coupled with the gangs of bandits who historically roamed the region , made Longde a county famous for its impoverishment . There are many mountains in Longde County .",
