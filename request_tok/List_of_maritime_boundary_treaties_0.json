The sovereign state is made of three historical regions : Tripolitania , Fezzan and Cyrenaica . With an area of almost 1.8 million square kilometres ( 700,000 sq mi ) , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa , and is the 16th largest country in the world . Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world . The largest city and capital , Tripoli , is located in western Libya and contains over one million of Libya 's six million people . The second-largest city is Benghazi , which is located in eastern Libya . The Latin name Libya is based on the name the region west of the Nile ( \u039b\u03b9\u03b2\u03cd\u03b7 ) used by the Ancient Greeks and Romans for all of North Africa , and was first adopted during the Italian colonization since 1911 . Libya has been inhabited by Berbers since the late Bronze Age as descendants from Iberomaurusian and Capsian cultures . The Phoenicians established trading posts in western Libya , and ancient Greek colonists established city-states in eastern Libya . Libya was variously ruled by Carthaginians , Persians , Egyptians and Greeks before becoming a part of the Roman Empire . Libya was an early centre of Christianity . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the Vandals until the 7th century , when invasions brought Islam to the region .",
  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain , and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language . The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9 , meli , honey . The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ( Melit\u0113 ) meaning honey-sweet , possibly for Malta 's unique production of honey ; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island . The Romans called the island Melita , which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 . In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin . Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized ( King James ) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901 . Malta is widely used in more recent versions , such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973 . Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth , a haven , or 'port ' in reference to Malta 's many bays and coves . Few other etymological mentions appear in classical literature , with the term Malta appearing in its present form in the Antonine Itinerary ( Itin . Marit . p. 518 ; Sil . Ital .",

The sovereign state is separated from the Comoros , Mayotte and Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east . The capital and largest city of Mozambique is Maputo ( formerly known as Louren\u00e7o Marques from 1876 to 1976 ) . Between the first and fifth centuries AD , Bantu-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique from farther north and west . Northern Mozambique lies within the monsoon trade winds of the Indian Ocean . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , a series of Swahili port towns developed here , which contributed to the development of a distinct Swahili culture and language . In the late medieval period , these towns were frequented by traders from Somalia , Ethiopia , Egypt , Arabia , Persia , and India . The voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498 marked the arrival of the Portuguese , who began a gradual process of colonisation and settlement in 1505 . After over four centuries of Portuguese rule , Mozambique gained independence in 1975 , becoming the People 's Republic of Mozambique shortly thereafter . After only two years of independence , the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992 . In 1994 , Mozambique held its first multiparty elections , and has since remained a relatively stable presidential republic , although it still faces a low-intensity insurgency . Mozambique is endowed with rich and extensive natural resources .",

It forms part of the Macaronesia ecoregion , along with the Azores , Canary Islands , Madeira , and the Savage Isles . Located 570 kilometres ( 350 mi ) west of the Cape Verde Peninsula off the coast of Northwest Africa , the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres ( 1,500 sq mi ) . The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century , when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands , establishing the first European settlement in the tropics . Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade , the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries , attracting merchants , privateers , and pirates . The end of transatlantic slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration . Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes . Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951 , the islands continued to campaign for independence , which was achieved in 1975 . Since the early 1990s , Cape Verde has been a stable representative democracy , and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa . Lacking natural resources , its developing economy is mostly service-oriented , with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment . Its population of around 540,000 is mostly of mixed European , Moorish , Arab and African heritage , and predominantly Roman Catholic , reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule . A sizeable diaspora community exists across the world , slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islands .",

The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language .
