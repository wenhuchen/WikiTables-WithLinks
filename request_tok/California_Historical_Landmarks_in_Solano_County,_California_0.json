  "/wiki/Benicia_Arsenal": "The Benicia Arsenal ( 1851-1964 ) and Benicia Barracks ( 1852-66 ) were part of a large military reservation located next to Suisun Bay in Benicia , California . For over 100 years , the arsenal was the primary US Army Ordnance facility for the West Coast of the United States . In 1847 a 252-acre ( 102 ha ) parcel of land adjoining the Benicia city limits on the east was acquired for a military reserve . First occupation of the post was on April 9 , 1849 , when two companies of the 2nd Infantry Regiment set up camp to establish Benicia Barracks , which also housed the 3rd Artillery Regiment . In 1851 , after the urging of General Persifor F. Smith , the first Ordnance Supply Depot in the West was established in Benicia . In 1852 it was designated Benicia Arsenal . Notable military personnel who were stationed there during this time include Ulysses Grant , Edward Ord , and Joseph Hooker , among others . The grounds of the Benicia Arsenal are also famous for stabling one of the elements of the Army 's Camel Corps . The short-lived Camel Corps was disbanded in 1863 , but the Camel Barns , built in 1855 , remain and are now the Benicia Historical Museum . The Benicia Arsenal was a staging area during the Civil War for Union troops from the West , and the installation remained a garrisoned post until 1898 when troops were assigned to duty in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War . During World War I , the Benicia Arsenal gave ordnance support to all large Army installations in the Western States as well as supplying Ordnance material to American expeditionary forces in Siberia . Italian Service Units of the 4th , 4th and 50th Italian Quartermaster Service Company worked at the Arsenal during World War 2 .",

  "/wiki/Rockville_Stone_Chapel": "An outgrowth of local camp meetings , Rockville Stone Chapel was constructed in the Fall of 1856 , in use by Christmas of that year , and dedicated in February 1857 . Divisions in the congregation over slavery soon split the congregation , with the Northern faction splitting off at Christmas Eve 1863 to form their own church . Attendance at the chapel slowly declined , with the last resident pastor leaving in 1895 . Although services continued sporadically , the building fell into disrepair and , in 1929 , the chapel was donated to the County of Solano . With the onset of the Great Depression that year , restoration did not occur for another decade , with the WPA finally accomplishing a full renovation in the Spring of 1940 .
