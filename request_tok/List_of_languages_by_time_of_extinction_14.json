Phrygian is considered by some linguists to have been closely related to Greek and/or Armenian . [ citation needed ] The similarity of some Phrygian words to Greek ones was observed by Plato in his Cratylus ( 410a ) . However , Eric P. Hamp suggests that Phrygian was related to Italo-Celtic in a hypothetical Northwest Indo-European group .",
  "/wiki/Indo-European_languages": "The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects in Asia and Europe . There are about 445 living Indo-European languages , according to the estimate by Ethnologue , with over two thirds ( 313 ) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch . The Indo-European languages with the greatest numbers of native speakers are Spanish , English , Hindustani ( Hindi/Urdu ) , Portuguese , Bengali , Punjabi , and Russian , each with over 100 million speakers , with German , French , Marathi , Italian , and Persian also having more than 50 million . Today , 46% of the world 's population ( 3.2 billion ) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language , by far the highest of any language family . The Indo-European family includes most of the modern languages of Europe . The language family is also represented in Asia with the exception of East and Southeast Asia . It was prominent ( alongside non-Indo-European languages ) in ancient Anatolia ( present-day Turkey ) , the ancient Tarim Basin ( present-day Northwest China ) and most of Central Asia until the medieval Turkic and Mongol invasions . Outside Eurasia , Indo-European languages are dominant in the Americas and much of Oceania and Africa , having reached there through colonialism during the Age of Discovery and later periods . Indo-European languages are also most commonly present as minority languages or second languages in countries where other families are dominant . With written evidence appearing from the Bronze Age in the form of Mycenaean Greek and the Anatolian languages Hittite and Luwian , the Indo-European family is significant to the field of historical linguistics as possessing the second-longest recorded history , after the Afroasiatic family in the form of the Egyptian language and the Semitic languages of the Near East . In addition , certain extinct language isolates of the Near East and Anatolia , such as Sumerian , Elamite , Hurrian , Hattian , Gutian , and Kassite are also recorded earlier than any Indo-European tongue . All Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language , reconstructed as Proto-Indo-European , spoken sometime in the Neolithic era .",

It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and North Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives . The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and early 20th centuries .",

Very little is known about ancient Ligurian , the lack of inscriptions does not allow a certain linguistic classification : Pre-Indo-European or an Indo-European language . The problem is closely related to the lack of inscriptions , and to the equally mysterious origin of the ancient Ligurian people . The linguistic hypotheses are mainly based on toponyms and names of persons .",

They form a branch of the Indo-European language family . The term Celtic was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707 , following Paul-Yves Pezron , who made the explicit link between the Celts described by classical writers and the Welsh and Breton languages . During the 1st millennium BC , Celtic languages were spoken across much of Europe and in Asia Minor . Today , they are restricted to the northwestern fringe of Europe and a few diaspora communities . There are four living languages : Welsh , Breton , Irish and Scottish Gaelic . All are minority languages in their respective countries , though there are continuing efforts at revitalisation . Welsh is an official language in Wales and Irish is an official language of Ireland and of the European Union . Welsh is the only Celtic language not classified as endangered by UNESCO . The Cornish and Manx languages went extinct in modern times . They have been the object of revivals and now each has several hundred second-language speakers . Irish , Scottish and Manx form the Goidelic languages , while Welsh , Cornish and Breton are Brittonic .",
  "/wiki/Hunnic_language": "The Hunnic language , or Hunnish , was the language spoken by Huns in the Hunnic Empire , a heterogeneous , multi-ethnic tribal confederation which ruled much of Eastern Europe and invaded the West during the 4th and 5th centuries . A variety of languages were spoken within the Hun Empire . A contemporary report by Priscus has that Hunnish was spoken alongside Gothic and the languages of other tribes subjugated by the Huns . As no inscriptions or whole sentences in the Hunnic language have been preserved , written evidence for the language is very limited , consisting almost entirely of proper names in Greek and Latin sources . The Hunnic language can not be classified at present , but due to the origin of these proper names it has been compared mainly with Turkic , Mongolic and Yeniseian languages . Many scholars consider the available evidence inconclusive .",

It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe .

The languages extend through 17 nations in the northern half of Africa : from Algeria to Benin in the west ; from Libya to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the centre ; and from Egypt to Tanzania in the east . As indicated by its hyphenated name , Nilo-Saharan is a family of the African interior , including the greater Nile Basin and the Central Sahara Desert . Eight of its proposed constituent divisions ( excluding Kunama , Kuliak , and Songhay ) are found in the modern two nations of Sudan and South Sudan , through which the Nile River flows . In his book The Languages of Africa ( 1963 ) , Joseph Greenberg named the group and argued it was a genetic family . It contains the languages which are not included in the Niger-Congo , Afroasiatic or Khoisan groups . Although some linguists have seen the phylum as Greenberg 's wastebasket , into which he placed all the otherwise unaffiliated non-click languages of Africa , specialists in the field have accepted its reality since Greenberg 's classification . Its supporters accept that it is a challenging proposal to demonstrate but contend that it looks more promising the more work is done . Some of the constituent groups of Nilo-Saharan are estimated to predate the African neolithic . Thus , the unity of Eastern Sudanic is estimated to date to at least the 5th millennium BC . Nilo-Saharan genetic unity would necessarily be much older still and date to the late Upper Paleolithic . This larger classification system is not accepted by all linguists , however .",

Before South Sudan 's secession from Sudan on 9 July 2011 , the united Sudan was the largest country in Africa and the Arab world by area . Sudan 's predominant religion is Islam , and its official languages are Arabic and English . The capital is Khartoum , located at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile . Since 2011 , Sudan has been the scene of an ongoing military conflict in its southern states . Sudan 's history goes back to the Pharaonic period , witnessing the kingdom of Kerma ( c. 2500 BC-1500 BC ) , the subsequent rule of the Egyptian New Kingdom ( c. 1500 BC-1070 BC ) and the rise of the kingdom of Kush ( c. 785 BC-350 AD ) , which would in turn control Egypt itself for nearly a century . After the fall of Kush , the Nubians formed the three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia , Makuria and Alodia , with the latter two lasting until around 1500 . Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by Arab nomads . From the 16th-19th centuries , central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the Funj sultanate , while Darfur ruled the west and the Ottomans the far north .

The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch throughout the whole of Bulgaria from the Serbian-Bulgarian border to the Black Sea coast . The Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea in the northwest , the Ionian Sea in the southwest , the Aegean Sea in the south , the Turkish Straits in the east , and the Black Sea in the northeast . The northern border of the peninsula is variously defined . The highest point of the Balkans is Mount Musala , 2,925 metres ( 9,596 ft ) , in the Rila mountain range , Bulgaria . The concept of the Balkan peninsula was created by the German geographer August Zeune in 1808 , who mistakenly considered the Balkan Mountains the dominant mountain system of Southeast Europe spanning from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea . The term of Balkan Peninsula was a synonym for Rumelia ( European Turkey ) in the 19th century , the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire in Southeast Europe . It had a geopolitical rather than a geographical definition , further promoted during the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the early 20th century . The definition of the Balkan peninsula 's natural borders do not coincide with the technical definition of a peninsula and hence modern geographers reject the idea of a Balkan peninsula , while scholars usually discuss the Balkans as a region .

Most scripts used to write Semitic languages are abjads - a type of alphabetic script that omits some or all of the vowels , which is feasible for these languages because the consonants in the Semitic languages are the primary carriers of meaning . Among them are the Ugaritic , Phoenician , Aramaic , Hebrew , Syriac , Arabic , and South Arabian alphabets . The Ge'ez script , used for writing the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea , is technically an abugida - a modified abjad in which vowels are notated using diacritic marks added to the consonants at all times , in contrast with other Semitic languages which indicate diacritics based on need or for introductory purposes . Maltese is the only Semitic language written in the Latin script and the only Semitic language to be an official language of the European Union . The Semitic languages are notable for their nonconcatenative morphology . That is , word roots are not themselves syllables or words , but instead are isolated sets of consonants ( usually three , making a so-called triliteral root ) . Words are composed out of roots not so much by adding prefixes or suffixes , but rather by filling in the vowels between the root consonants ( although prefixes and suffixes are often added as well ) .",
  "/wiki/North_Africa": "North Africa is a region encompassing the northern portion of the African continent . There is no singularly accepted scope for the region , and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of Mauritania in the west , to Egypt 's Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the east . Others [ Like whom ? ] have limited it to the countries of Algeria , Morocco , and Tunisia , a region that was known by the French during colonial times as Afrique du Nord and is known by Arabs as the Maghreb ( West , The western part of Arab World ) . The most commonly accepted definition includes Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , Libya , Egypt , and Sudan , the 6 countries that shape the top North of the African continent . Meanwhile , North Africa , particularly when used in the term North Africa and the Middle East , often refers only to the countries of the Maghreb and Libya . Egypt , being also part of the Middle East , is often considered separately , due to being both North African and Middle Eastern at the same time . North Africa includes a number of Spanish and Portuguese possessions , Plazas de soberan\u00eda , Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands and Madeira . The countries of North Africa share a common ethnic , cultural and linguistic identity that is unique to this region . Northwest Africa has been inhabited by Berbers since the beginning of recorded history , while the eastern part of North Africa has been home to the Egyptians . Between the A.D. 600s and 1000s , Arabs from the Middle East swept across the region in a wave of Muslim conquest . These peoples , physically quite similar , formed a single population in many areas , as Berbers and Egyptians merged into Arabic and Muslim culture ."
