  "/wiki/Wesleyan": "Wesleyan theology , otherwise known as Wesleyan-Arminian theology , or Methodist theology , is a theological tradition in Protestant Christianity that emphasizes the methods of the eighteenth-century evangelical reformers John Wesley and his brother Charles Wesley . More broadly , it refers to the theological system inferred from the various sermons , theological treatises , letters , journals , diaries , hymns , and other spiritual writings of the Wesleys and their contemporary coadjutors such as John William Fletcher . Wesleyan-Arminian theology , manifest today in Methodism ( inclusive of the Holiness movement ) , is named for its founders , the Wesleys , as well as for Jacob Arminius , since it is a subset of Arminian theology . In 1736 , these two brothers traveled to the Georgia colony in America as missionaries for the Church of England ; they left rather disheartened at what they saw . Both of them subsequently had religious experiences , especially John in 1738 , being greatly influenced by the Moravian Christians . They began to organize a renewal movement within the Church of England to focus on personal faith and holiness . John Wesley took Protestant churches to task over the nature of sanctification , the process by which a believer is conformed to the image of Christ , emphasizing New Testament teachings regarding the work of God and the believer in sanctification . The movement did well within the Church of England in Britain , but when the movement crossed the ocean into America , it took on a form of its own , finally being established as the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1784 . The Methodist churches are similar to Anglicanism ( in Church government and liturgical practices ) , yet have added a strong emphasis on personal faith and personal experience , especially on the new birth and entire sanctification . At its heart , the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness : to love God with all ones heart , mind , soul and strength , and to love one 's neighbour as oneself . Wesleys teaching also stressed experiential religion and moral responsibility .",
