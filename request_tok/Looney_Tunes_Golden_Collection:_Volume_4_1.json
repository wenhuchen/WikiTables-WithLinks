  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power , and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character . Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts , Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! This slogan ( without stuttering ) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series ( when Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , in his Brooklynese accent , And Dat 's De End ! ) . He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character . Porky 's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter , for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words ; for example , What 's going on ? might become What 's guh-guh-guh-guh - .what 's happening ? Porky 's age varied widely in the series ; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet ( explicitly mentioned as such in Porky 's Preview ) , Porky was more frequently cast as an adult , often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years . In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons , Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head , and his attempt to close the show with The End becomes Th-Th-The , Th-Th-The , Th-Th .",

  "/wiki/Elmer_Fudd": "Elmer J. Fudd is a fictional cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies series , and an adversary of Bugs Bunny . He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon ( second only to Bugs himself ) . His aim is to hunt Bugs , but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters . He speaks in an unusual way , replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws , so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a scwewy wabbit . Elmer 's signature catchphrase is , Shhh . Be vewy vewy quiet , I 'm hunting wabbits , as well as his trademark laughter . The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones ' work What 's Opera , Doc ? ( one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs , though he felt bad about it ) , the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville , and the Hunting Trilogy of Rabbit Season/Duck Season shorts ( Rabbit Fire , Rabbit Seasoning , and Duck ! Rabbit , Duck ! ) with Fudd , Bugs Bunny , and Daffy Duck . An earlier character named Egghead set some of Elmer 's aspects before the character 's more conspicuous features were set ."
