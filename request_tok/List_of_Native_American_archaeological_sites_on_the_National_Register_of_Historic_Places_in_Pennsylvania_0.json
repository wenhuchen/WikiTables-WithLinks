At 444 miles ( 715 km ) long , it is the longest river on the East Coast of the United States that drains into the Chesapeake Bay . With its watershed , it is the 16th-largest river in the United States , and the longest river in the early 21st-century continental United States without commercial boat traffic . The Susquehanna River forms from two main branches : the North Branch , which rises in Cooperstown , New York , and is regarded by federal mapmakers as the main branch or headwaters , and the West Branch , which rises in western Pennsylvania and joins the main branch near Northumberland in central Pennsylvania . The river drains 27,500 square miles ( 71,000 km2 ) , including nearly half of the land area of Pennsylvania . The drainage basin ( watershed ) includes portions of the Allegheny Plateau region of the Appalachian Mountains , cutting through a succession of water gaps in a broad zigzag course to flow across the rural heartland of southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland in the lateral near-parallel array of mountain ridges .

As of the 2010 census , the population was 519,445 . Its county seat is Lancaster . Lancaster County comprises the Lancaster , Pennsylvania , Metropolitan Statistical Area and is a part of Philadelphia 's Designated Media Market . The County of Lancaster is a popular tourist destination , with its Amish community a major attraction . Contrary to popular belief , the word Dutch in Pennsylvania Dutch not a mistranslation , but rather a corruption of the Pennsylvania German endonym Deitsch , which means Pennsylvania Dutch / German or German . Ultimately , the terms Deitsch , Dutch , Diets and Deutsch are all cognates of the Proto-Germanic word *\u00feiudiskaz meaning popular or of the people . The continued use of Dutch instead of German was strengthend by the Pennsylvania Dutch in the 19th century as a way of distinguising themselves from later ( post 1830 ) waves of German immigrants to the United States , with the Pennsylvania Dutch referring to themselves as Deitsche and to Germans as Deitschlenner ( literally Germany-ers , compare Deutschland-er ) whom they saw as a related but distinct group . The ancestors of the Amish began to immigrate to colonial Pennsylvania in the early 18th century to take advantage of the religious freedom offered by William Penn . They were also attracted by the area 's rich soil and mild climate . Also attracted to promises of religious freedom , French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution settled this area in 1710 . There were also significant numbers of English , Welsh and Ulster Scots ( also known as the Scotch-Irish in the colonies ) .",
  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

Their territory encompassed the entire drainage basin of the Susquehanna River which shares the tribe 's root name and extended to the drainage divides of the flanking mountains both to the East to the Delaware nation and to the West to Shawnee lands . The town is the earliest established known surviving settlement of the tribe , and it is known that William Penn himself visited to negotiate with the tribal leaders ; but by then its people were well past its tipping point and were fading into insignificance . The site is also one known to be among the last occupied of the Susquehannock town sites in Pennsylvania as they faded into obscurity .

They traded with other Indian groups who in turn traded with Europeans . The Monongahela seem to have disappeared some time during the 1620s or 1630s before having significant direct contact with Europeans . Many scholars believe this to be the result of the spread of European infectious diseases . Others believe that most of the Monongahela were killed by or assimilated into either the Iroquois or the Algonquian-speaking Lenape tribes during warfare , as the more powerful tribes competed to control area hunting grounds for the fur trade .

More complete records were obtained after a 1980 investigation , which was part of the planning for the construction of baseball fields in the vicinity . Because archaeologists discovered a significant range of artifacts in the location , the fields were moved to allow for continued excavation . This investigation determined that the site was that of a Monongahela village . :2 Evidence of warfare dominated the findings from the Household 1 Site . Many burials were present at the site - including sixteen at the site of one house alone - and projectile points composed a much larger percentage of the total findings than did domestic tools . Furthermore , the small total number of artifacts overall shows that the site was only occupied for a short period of time , and its location on a river bluff suggests that its site was chosen for defensibility . These discoveries , like those at many other Monongahela village sites , demonstrate that the Household residents lived in a highly martial culture . :4 In 1986 , the Household Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its archaeological significance .",
