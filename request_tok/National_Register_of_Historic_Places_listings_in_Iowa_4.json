  "/wiki/Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Depot_(Osceola,_Iowa)": "Osceola is an Amtrak intercity train station in Osceola , Iowa , United States served by Amtrak . Among Amtrak stations in Iowa , Osceola is closest to Des Moines , Iowa 's capital and most populous city ; however , the station is still almost 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the center of Des Moines . The Osceola Depot was built in 1907 by the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad ( CB & Q ) , one of the major networks operating in the upper Midwest and West during much of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries . Designed in the Prairie Style , the reddish-brown brick depot has a low slung , horizontal profile reinforced by the limestone water table and belt courses that wrap around the building . Originally a combination depot , the building contained freight and passenger areas under one roof . The ticket office retains many original features , such as ticket windows , wood benches and light fixtures . It passed to Burlington Northern in 1970 upon the Q 's merger with Great Northern and Northern Pacific , and became part of the BNSF Railway in 1995 . In 2007 , following a decade of talks with BNSF , the city of Osceola gained ownership of the historic building . Working with an architect specializing in historic preservation , the city planned a multi-phase restoration of the depot and parking area to create an intermodal transportation hub to better serve Amtrak and intercity bus riders . The restoration of the exterior was funded in part by $ 600,000 in federal funds obtained through the Iowa Department of Transportation . This project included the installation of a new roof , reconstruction of a damaged chimney , restoration of existing windows , installation of new historically appropriate storm windows , manufacture of new entry doors that match the originals , re-pointing of the mortar that holds the bricks in place , and general rehabilitation and cleaning of the brick and stone surfaces . City officials also hope to restore the interior if funding can be found .",
