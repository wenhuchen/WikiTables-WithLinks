It was headquartered in Roanoke , Virginia , for most of its existence . Its motto was Precision Transportation ; it had a variety of nicknames , including King Coal and British Railway of America . During the Civil War , the N & W was the largest railroad in the Confederacy and played an important role in moving supplies for the war effort . The N & W was famous for manufacturing its own steam locomotives , which were built at the Roanoke Shops , as well as its own hopper cars . After 1960 , N & W was the last major Class I railroad using steam locomotives ; the last remaining Y class 2-8-8-2s would eventually be retired between 1964 and 1965 . In December 1959 , the N & W merged with the Virginian Railway ( reporting mark VGN ) , a longtime rival in the Pocahontas coal region . By 1970 , other mergers with the Nickel Plate Road and Wabash formed a system that operated 7,595 miles ( 12,223 km ) of road on 14,881 miles ( 23,949 km ) of track from North Carolina to New York and from Virginia to Iowa . In 1980 , the N & W merged its business operation with those of the Southern Railway , another profitable carrier to create the Norfolk Southern Corporation holding company . The N & W and the Southern Railway continued as separate railroads operating under a single holding company . On June 1 , 1982 , the Southern Railway was renamed Norfolk Southern Railway and the holding company transferred the Norfolk & Western Railway to the control of the newly renamed company . The Norfolk & Western would continue to operate on paper until 1997 , when it was fully absorbed into the Norfolk Southern during that company 's battle with CSX Transportation over control of rival Conrail .",

  "/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad": "The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( reporting marks B & O , BO ) was the first common carrier railroad and the oldest railroad in the United States , with its first section opening in 1830 . Merchants from the city of Baltimore , which had benefitted to some extent from the construction of the National Road early in the century , wanted to continue to compete for trade with trans-Appalachian settlers with the newly constructed Erie Canal ( which served New York City ) , another canal being proposed by Pennsylvania ( which would have connected Philadelphia and Pittsburgh ) , the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal ( which connected to the nation 's capital , Washington , D.C. ) , and the James River Canal , which directed traffic toward Richmond and Norfolk , Virginia . At first the B & O was located entirely in the state of Maryland , its original line extending from the port of Baltimore west to Sandy Hook . Because of competition with the C & O canal for trade with coal fields in western Maryland , it could not use the C & O right of way . Thus , to continue westward while minimizing high-cost track through the Appalachian Mountains , the B & O chose to cross the Potomac River into Virginia ( now West Virginia ) , near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers . From there track continued through Virginia from Harpers Ferry to a point just west of the junction of Patterson Creek and the North Branch Potomac River , where it crossed back into Maryland to reach Cumberland , the terminus of the National Road . From there the B & O extended to the Ohio River at Wheeling and a few years later also to Parkersburg , West Virginia ( below rapids which made navigation difficult during parts of the year ) . It proved crucial to Union success during the American Civil War , although the conflict also caused considerable damage ( and repair costs ) . After the war 's end , the B & O consolidated several feeder lines in Virginia and West Virginia , as well as expanded westward into Ohio ( including a junction at Portsmouth ) , Indiana and Illinois . B & O advertising later carried the motto : Linking 13 Great States with the Nation . After several mergers , the B & O became part of the CSX Transportation ( CSX ) network . The B & O also includes the Leiper Railroad , the first permanent horse-drawn railroad in the U.S. At the end of 1970 , the B & O operated 5,552 miles of road and 10,449 miles of track , not including the Staten Island Rapid Transit ( SIRT ) or the Reading and its subsidiaries .",

New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II .

New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population .",
  "/wiki/Washington\u2013Chicago_Express": "The Washington-Chicago Express , an American named passenger train of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( B & O ) , was one of four daily B & O trains operating between Washington , D.C. , and Chicago , Illinois , via Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania during the 1920s-1960s . Other B & O trains of that period on the route were the Capitol Limited , Columbian , and the Shenandoah . Operating westbound as Train # 9 , the Chicago Express , and eastbound as Train # 10 , the Washington Express , it was an accommodation train , meaning that it made stops at most stations along the route bypassed by B & O 's other trains , resulting in a slower timecard than the more prestigious Capitol Limited . The Washington-Chicago Express required a leisurely 18\u00bd hours for its 767-mile ( 1,234 km ) journey , compared to the faster Capitol Limited 's 16-hour pace . The Washington-Chicago Express was also B & O 's primary train for mail and Railway Express Agency shipments , having heavy head end equipment consisting of several Railway Post Office ( RPO ) cars , baggage cars , and bulk mail boxcars . The Washington-Chicago Express continued to offer Pullman sleeping car and dining car service into the mid-1960s , but the ending of B & O 's mail contract in the late-1960s by the U.S . Postal Service spelled the doom of the train , resulting in its discontinuation in 1967 before the advent of Amtrak in 1971 .",
