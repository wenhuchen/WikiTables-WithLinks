  "/wiki/Hindustani_language": "Hindustani , also known as Hindi-Urdu and historically known as Hindi , Hindavi , Urdu , Dehlavi , and Rekhta , is the lingua franca of Northern India and Pakistan . According to the Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World , Hindustani is an Indo-Aryan language , deriving its base primarily from the Western Hindi dialect of Delhi , also known as Khariboli . Hindustani is a pluricentric language , with two standardised registers , Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu . The term Hindustani was used in the colonial period ; the term Hindi-Urdu has been in common use among scholars since 1980 . Also according to the Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World , Hindustani as a colloquial speech developed over almost seven centuries from 1100 to 1800 . The Muslims conquered northern India from the 10th to the 13th centuries and settled down in the country , bringing with them their Persian language and culture . This mixing of cultures provided the contact situation for the emergence of Hindustani as a lingua franca . According to linguist Colin P. Masica , the term Hindustani was much in vogue during Independence movement as expression of national unity ; after Partition in 1947 and subsequent linguistic polarization it fell into disfavor According to Encyclopaedia Britannica , 1961 , The everyday speech of well over 50,000,000 persons of all communities in the north of India and in West Pakistan is the expression of a common language , Hindustani . The Hindi film industry has employed Hindustani which included many Urdu and Persian words ; Bollywood 's screenplays are written in Hindustani . The language 's core vocabulary is derived from Prakrit ( a descendant of Sanskrit ) , with substantial loanwords from Persian and Arabic ( via Persian ) . The number of speakers can only be estimated . Ethnologue reports that , as of 2019 , Hindi and Urdu together constitute the 3rd-most-spoken language in the world after English and Mandarin , with 785 million native and second-language speakers , though this includes millions who self-reported their language as 'Hindi ' on the Indian census but speak a number of other Hindi languages than Hindustani .",

The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company 's army in the garrison town of Meerut , 40 mi ( 64 km ) northeast of Delhi ( now Old Delhi ) . It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India , [ a ] [ b ] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east . [ c ] The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region , [ d ] and was contained only with the rebels ' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858 . On 1 November 1858 , the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder , though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859 . Its name is contested , variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny , the Indian Mutiny , the Great Rebellion , the Revolt of 1857 , the Indian Insurrection , and the First War of Independence . [ e ] The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions , including invasive British-style social reforms , harsh land taxes , summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes , as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule . [ f ] Many Indians rose against the British ; however , many also fought for the British , and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule . [ g ] Violence , which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty , was inflicted on both sides , on British officers , and civilians , including women and children , by the rebels , and on the rebels , and their supporters , including sometimes entire villages , by British reprisals ; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation . [ h ] After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut , the rebels quickly reached Delhi , whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler , Bahadur Shah Zafar , was declared the Emperor of Hindustan . Soon , the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh ( Oudh ) . The East India Company 's response came rapidly as well .",

[ web 1 ] Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies . It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE , spreading through much of Asia . Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars : Theravada ( Pali : The School of the Elders ) and Mahayana ( Sanskrit : The Great Vehicle ) . Most Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth , either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood . Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation , the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts , and their specific teachings and practices . Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha , the Dharma and the Sangha , observance of moral precepts , monasticism , meditation , and the cultivation of the Paramitas ( perfections , or virtues ) . Theravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar and Thailand . Mahayana , which includes the traditions of Pure Land , Zen , Nichiren Buddhism , Shingon and Tiantai ( Tendai ) , is found throughout East Asia .

Jainism is a transtheistic religion , and Jains trace their spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as tirthankaras , with the first being Rishabhanatha , who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago , the twenty-third Tirthankara Parshvanatha in 900 BCE , and the twenty-fourth Tirthankara the Mah\u0101v\u012bra around 500 BCE . Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology . Their religious texts are called Agamas . The main religious premises of Jainism are ahi\u1e43s\u0101 ( non-violence ) , anek\u0101ntav\u0101da ( many-sidedness ) , aparigraha ( non-attachment ) and asceticism . Devout Jains take five main vows : ahi\u1e43s\u0101 ( non-violence ) , satya ( truth ) , asteya ( not stealing ) , brahmacharya ( celibacy or chastity or sexual continence ) , and aparigraha ( non-possessiveness ) . These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways , such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles . Parasparopagraho J\u012bv\u0101n\u0101m ( the function of souls is to help one another ) is the motto of Jainism . \u1e46am\u014dk\u0101ra mantra is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism . Jainism has two major ancient sub-traditions , Digambaras and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras ; Several smaller sub-traditions emerged in the 2nd millennium CE .

Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence , having been widely sourced during the era of the British Empire . It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present . [ a ] It was the first public national museum in the world . The British Museum was established in 1753 , largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane . It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building . Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions , the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881 . In 1973 , the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum , but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997 .

  "/wiki/Dravidian_languages": "The Dravidian languages are a language family spoken by more than 215 million people , mainly in southern India and northern Sri Lanka , with pockets elsewhere in South Asia . Since the colonial era , there have been small but significant immigrant communities outside South Asia in countries such as Mauritius , Hong Kong , Pakistan , Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , Philippines , Britain , Australia , and the United States . The Dravidian languages are first attested in the 2nd century BCE as Tamil-Brahmi script inscribed on the cave walls in the Madurai and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu . [ a ] The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are ( in descending order of number of speakers ) Telugu , Tamil , Kannada and Malayalam , all of which have long literary traditions . Smaller literary languages are Tulu and Kodava . There are also small groups of Dravidian-speaking scheduled tribes , who live outside Dravidian-speaking areas , such as the Kurukh in Eastern India and Gondi in Central India . Only two Dravidian languages are spoken exclusively outside the post-1947 state of India : Brahui in the Balochistan region of Pakistan and Afghanistan ; and Dhangar , a dialect of Kurukh , in parts of Nepal and Bhutan . [ better source needed ] Dravidian place names along the Arabian Sea coasts and Dravidian grammatical influence such as clusivity in the Indo-Aryan languages , namely Marathi , Konkani , Gujarati , Marwari , and Sindhi , suggest that Dravidian languages were once spoken more widely across the Indian subcontinent . Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations from the Iranian plateau in the fourth or third millennium BCE or even earlier , the Dravidian languages can not easily be connected to any other language family and they could well be indigenous to India .
