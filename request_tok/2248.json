  "/wiki/C++": "C++ ( /\u02ccsi\u02d0\u02ccpl\u028cs\u02c8pl\u028cs/ ) is a high-level , general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language , or C with Classes . The language has expanded significantly over time , and modern C++ has object-oriented , generic , and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation . It is almost always implemented as a compiled language , and many vendors provide C++ compilers , including the Free Software Foundation , LLVM , Microsoft , Intel , Oracle , and IBM , so it is available on many platforms . C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded , resource-constrained software and large systems , with performance , efficiency , and flexibility of use as its design highlights . C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts , with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications , including desktop applications , video games , servers ( e.g . e-commerce , Web search , or SQL servers ) , and performance-critical applications ( e.g . telephone switches or space probes ) . C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 ( informally known as C++17 ) . The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 , which was then amended by the C++03 , C++11 and C++14 standards . The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library . Before the initial standardization in 1998 , C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language ; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization . C++20 is the next planned standard , keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years .",

  "/wiki/Swing_(Java)": "Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java . It is part of Oracle 's Java Foundation Classes ( JFC ) - an API for providing a graphical user interface ( GUI ) for Java programs . Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit ( AWT ) . Swing provides a look and feel that emulates the look and feel of several platforms , and also supports a pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform . It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT . In addition to familiar components such as buttons , check boxes and labels , Swing provides several advanced components such as tabbed panel , scroll panes , trees , tables , and lists . Unlike AWT components , Swing components are not implemented by platform-specific code . Instead , they are written entirely in Java and therefore are platform-independent . The term lightweight is used to describe such an element . In December 2008 , Sun Microsystems ( Oracle 's predecessor ) released the CSS / FXML based framework that it intended to be the successor to Swing , called JavaFX .",
  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",

Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers , from supercomputers to embedded systems . C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix . Later , it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system . During the 1980s , C gradually gained popularity . It has become one of the most widely used programming languages , with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems . C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 ( see ANSI C ) and by the International Organization for Standardization . C is an imperative procedural language . It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions , all with minimal runtime support . Despite its low-level capabilities , the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming . A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code .",

  "/wiki/Pickle_(Python)": "In computer science , in the context of data storage , serialization ( or serialisation ) is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored ( for example , in a file or memory buffer ) or transmitted ( for example , across a network connection link ) and reconstructed later ( possibly in a different computer environment ) . When the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization format , it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the original object . For many complex objects , such as those that make extensive use of references , this process is not straightforward . Serialization of object-oriented objects does not include any of their associated methods with which they were previously linked . This process of serializing an object is also called marshalling an object in some situations . The opposite operation , extracting a data structure from a series of bytes , is deserialization ( also called unmarshalling ) .",

Cocoa applications are typically developed using the development tools provided by Apple , specifically Xcode ( formerly Project Builder ) and Interface Builder ( now part of Xcode ) , using the programming languages Objective-C or Swift . However , the Cocoa programming environment can be accessed using other tools , such as Clozure CL , LispWorks , Object Pascal , Python , Perl , Ruby , and AppleScript with the aid of bridge mechanisms such as PasCocoa , PyObjC , CamelBones , RubyCocoa , and a D/Objective-C Bridge . A Ruby language implementation named MacRuby , which removes the need for a bridge mechanism , was formerly developed by Apple , while Nu is a Lisp-like language that can be used with Cocoa with no bridge . It is also possible to write Objective-C Cocoa programs in a simple text editor and build it manually with GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) or Clang from the command line or from a makefile . For end-users , Cocoa applications are those written using the Cocoa programming environment . Such applications usually have a familiar look and feel , since the Cocoa programming environment automates many aspects of an application to comply with Apple 's human interface guidelines .
