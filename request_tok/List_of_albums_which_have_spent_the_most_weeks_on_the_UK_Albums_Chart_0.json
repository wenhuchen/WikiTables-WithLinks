Madonna is often cited as an influence by other artists . Born and raised in Michigan , Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance . After performing as a drummer , guitarist , and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy , Madonna signed with Sire Records in 1982 and released her eponymous debut album the next year . She followed it with a series of successful albums , including global bestsellers Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) and True Blue ( 1986 ) as well as Grammy Award winners Ray of Light ( 1998 ) and Confessions on a Dance Floor ( 2005 ) . Many of her songs have reached the top of record charts worldwide , including Like a Virgin , La Isla Bonita , Like a Prayer , Vogue , Take a Bow , Frozen , Music , Hung Up , and 4 Minutes . Madonna 's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan ( 1985 ) , Dick Tracy ( 1990 ) , A League of Their Own ( 1992 ) , and Evita ( 1996 ) . While Evita earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress , many of her other films received poor reviews .

Prior to the release of Foo Fighters ' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters , which featured Grohl as the only official member , Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith , both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate , as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup . The band began with performances in Portland , Oregon . Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group 's second album , The Colour and the Shape ( 1997 ) , when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself . Smear 's departure followed soon afterward , though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006 , and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011 . They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl , respectively , although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group 's third album , There Is Nothing Left to Lose ( 1999 ) . The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band 's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose .

The album cover , which shows a naked baby swimming with a U.S. dollar bill on a fishhook just out of his reach , is often considered as one of the most famous album covers in popular music . For the preparation of Nevermind , Cobain wrote a number of songs that were influenced by bands like The Melvins , R.E.M. , The Smithereens , and the Pixies . A key development was the single Sliver , released on Sub Pop in 1990 , which Cobain said was like a statement in a way . I had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record . I wanted to write more songs like that . Despite the initial low commercial expectations , Nevermind became an unexpected breakout success . In January 1992 , it reached number one on the US Billboard 200 .

In the late 1980s , Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene , releasing its first album , Bleach , for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989 . They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts , often between quiet verses and loud , heavy choruses . After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991 , Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with Smells Like Teen Spirit , the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind ( 1991 ) . A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s , the album went on to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Nirvana 's sudden success popularized alternative rock , and Cobain found himself described as the spokesman of a generation and Nirvana the flagship band of Generation X . Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning , Nirvana released their third studio album , In Utero ( 1993 ) , to critical acclaim and further chart success . Its abrasive , less mainstream sound challenged the band 's audience , and though less successful than Nevermind , it was a commercial success .
