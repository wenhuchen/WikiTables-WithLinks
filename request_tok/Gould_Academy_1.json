There is a humid continental climate throughout most of the state , including coastal areas . Maine 's most populous city is Portland and its capital is Augusta . For thousands of years , indigenous peoples were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine . At the time of European arrival in what is now Maine , several Algonquian-speaking peoples inhabited the area . The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on Saint Croix Island , by Pierre Dugua , Sieur de Mons . The first English settlement was the short-lived Popham Colony , established by the Plymouth Company in 1607 . A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s , although the rugged climate , deprivations , and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years .",

From 1814 to 1905 , Sweden and Norway were in a personal union . Although each country was fully sovereign , they had a common foreign policy and diplomatic service . The United States Ambassador to Sweden thus was the US representative to Norway as well as Sweden . In 1905 Sweden and Norway peacefully separated and Norway continued to be an independent constitutional monarchy . On November 14 , 1905 , the US State Department instructed Ambassador Charles H. Graves to handle affairs for Sweden and Norway separately and the Ambassador was thus commissioned to Norway equally with Sweden , though he remained in Stockholm . On June 22 , 1906 , Herbert H. D. Peirce was appointed to be the first ambassador of the US appointed specifically solely for Norway . On August 6 , 1906 , the embassy in Stockholm ceased all functions related to Norway .

Throughout the state 's history , four men have served two non-consecutive terms as governor , and two others have served two consecutive terms . Kentucky is one of only five U.S. states that hold gubernatorial elections in odd-numbered years . The current governor is Andy Beshear , who was first elected in 2019 . The governor 's powers are enumerated in the state constitution . There have been four constitutions of Kentucky - adopted in 1792 , 1799 , 1850 , and 1891 , respectively - and each has enlarged the governor 's authority . Among the powers appropriated to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons , veto legislation , and call the legislature into session . The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state 's military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state . The officeholder is given broad statutory authority to make appointments to the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch , limited somewhat by the adoption of a merit system for state employees in 1960 . Because Kentucky 's governor controls so many appointments to commissions , the office has been historically considered one of the most powerful state executive positions in the United States .",
