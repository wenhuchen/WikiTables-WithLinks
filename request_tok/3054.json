  "/wiki/Sarnia,_Ontario": "Sarnia is a city in Southwestern Ontario , Canada , and had a 2016 population of 71,594 . It is the largest city on Lake Huron and in Lambton County . Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River , which forms the Canada-United States border , directly across from Port Huron , Michigan . The site 's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle . He named the site The Rapids on 23 August 1679 , when he had horses and men pull his 45-ton barque Le Griffon north against the nearly four-knot current of the St. Clair River . This was the first time that a vessel other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron , and La Salle 's voyage was germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes . Located in the natural harbour , the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products . The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas , together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 , led to the dramatic growth of the petroleum industry in this area . Because Oil Springs was the first place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil , the knowledge that was acquired there resulted in oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other enterprises and nations how to drill for oil . The complex of refining and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia . In 2011 the city had the highest level of particulates air pollution of any Canadian city , but it has since dropped to rank 30th in this hazard . About 60 percent of the particulate matter comes industries and polluters in the neighbouring United States .",
