  "/wiki/I-90_(NY)": "Interstate 90 ( I-90 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Seattle , Washington , to Boston , Massachusetts .

Although most of the route is part of the tolled New York State Thruway , two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 ( the first , situated outside of Buffalo , is included in the Thruway system ; the second , situated in the Capital District , is not part of the Thruway system and links Albany and its eastern suburbs ) . Within New York , I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates , which means that there are interstates numbered I-190 through I-990 in the state , with no gaps in between . For most of its length in New York , I-90 runs parallel to the former Erie Canal route , New York State Route 5 ( NY 5 ) , U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) and the CSX railroad mainline that traverses the state . I-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System . In New York , it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany , from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the Berkshire Connector to the north . Ultimately , the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in Schodack , and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway . The Albany-Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977 .",
  "/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway": "The New York State Thruway ( officially the Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and colloquially the Thruway ) is a system of controlled-access highways spanning 569.83 miles ( 917.05 km ) within the U.S. state of New York . It is operated by the New York State Thruway Authority ( NYSTA ) , a New York State public-benefit corporation . The 496.00-mile ( 798.23 km ) mainline is a toll road that extends from the New York City line at Yonkers to the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley by way of Albany , Syracuse , and Buffalo . According to the International Bridge , Tunnel and Turnpike Association , the Thruway is the fifth busiest toll road in the United States . A tolled highway connecting the major cities of New York was first proposed as early as the 1940s . The first section of the Thruway , between Utica and Rochester , opened on June 24 , 1954 . The remainder of the mainline and many of its spurs connecting to highways in other states and provinces were built in the 1950s . In 1957 , much of the Thruway system was included as portions of Interstate 87 ( I-87 ) , I-90 , and I-95 . Other segments became part of I-190 and I-287 shortly afterward . Today , the system comprises six highways : the New York-Ripley mainline , the Berkshire Connector , the Garden State Parkway Connector , the New England Thruway ( I-95 ) , the Niagara Thruway ( I-190 ) , and the Cross-Westchester Expressway ( I-287 ) . The portion of I-84 in New York was maintained by the Thruway Authority from 1991 to 2010 , but was never part of the Thruway system and is currently maintained by NYSDOT . The Thruway utilizes a combination of closed ( ticket-based ) , and all-electronic ( open road ) tolling .",
