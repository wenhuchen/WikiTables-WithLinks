Hugo is considered to be one of the greatest and best-known French writers . Outside France , his most famous works are the novels Les Mis\u00e9rables , 1862 , and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame ( French : Notre-Dame de Paris ) , 1831 . In France , Hugo is known primarily for his poetry collections , such as Les Contemplations ( The Contemplations ) and La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles ( The Legend of the Ages ) . Hugo was at the forefront of the Romantic literary movement with his play Cromwell and drama Hernani . Many of his works have inspired music , both during his lifetime and after his death , including the musicals Les Mis\u00e9rables and Notre-Dame de Paris . He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime , and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment . Though a committed royalist when he was young , Hugo 's views changed as the decades passed , and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism ; his work touches upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time . He is buried in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris . His legacy has been honoured in many ways , including his portrait being placed on French currency .",

His works include : four novels ; epic and lyric poetry ; prose and verse dramas ; memoirs ; an autobiography ; literary and aesthetic criticism ; and treatises on botany , anatomy , and colour . In addition , numerous literary and scientific fragments , more than 10,000 letters , and nearly 3,000 drawings by him have survived . A literary celebrity by the age of 25 , Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar , Karl August , in 1782 after taking up residence in Weimar in November 1775 following the success of his first novel , The Sorrows of Young Werther ( 1774 ) . He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement . During his first ten years in Weimar , Goethe became a member of the Duke 's privy council , sat on the war and highway commissions , oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau , and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena . He also contributed to the planning of Weimar 's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace . [ a ] Goethe 's first major scientific work , the Metamorphosis of Plants , was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy . In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar , and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist , historian , and philosopher Friedrich Schiller , whose plays he premiered until Schiller 's death in 1805 . During this period Goethe published his second novel , Wilhelm Meister 's Apprenticeship ; the verse epic Hermann and Dorothea , and , in 1808 , the first part of his most celebrated drama , Faust . His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller , Johann Gottlieb Fichte , Johann Gottfried Herder , Alexander von Humboldt , Wilhelm von Humboldt , and August and Friedrich Schlegel have come to be collectively termed Weimar Classicism . The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer named Wilhelm Meister 's Apprenticeship one of the four greatest novels ever written , [ b ] while the American philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six representative men in his work of the same name ( along with Plato , Emanuel Swedenborg , Montaigne , Napoleon , and Shakespeare ) .",

During his stay in Italy he frequently visited his friend and fellow poet Percy Bysshe Shelley . Later in life Byron joined the Greek War of Independence fighting the Ottoman Empire and died of disease leading a campaign during that war , for which Greeks revere him as a national hero . He died in 1824 at the age of 36 from a fever contracted after the First and Second Siege of Missolonghi .

The supernatural references are made clear throughout the poem . Manfred was adapted musically by Robert Schumann in 1852 , in a composition entitled Manfred : Dramatic Poem with Music in Three Parts , and later by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in his Manfred Symphony . Friedrich Nietzsche was inspired by the poem 's depiction of a super-human being to compose a piano score in 1872 based on it , Manfred Meditation .",

It was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 30 November 1872 . It was the first full-length opera by Massenet to be produced , the one-act La grand'tante having been mounted five years earlier by the same company . Don C\u00e9sar de Bazan was not a success and it would be another five years , with the premiere of Le roi de Lahore in 1877 , before Massenet rose to his place among the most prominent composers of his time . Don C\u00e9sar de Bazan was initially performed 13 times at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique . After the fire at the Salle Favart when the parts were lost , Massenet constructed a new version from the vocal score , and this was performed in Geneva in 1888 , then Antwerp , Brussels , the French provinces and the Ga\u00eet\u00e9-Lyrique in 1912 , and the Hague in 1925 .

It used a plot occupied by a store for ancient statues in the royal collection , on which Grimod de La Reyni\u00e8re had obtained a royal concession to construct a building similar to the h\u00f4tel de Saint-Florentin ( which had been constructed in the northeastern corner of the new Place Louis XV , now Place de la Concorde , to plans by Ange-Jacques Gabriel ) . The layout of the rooms is known from a relief by the architect Johann Christian Kammsetzer , preserved at Cracow . The grand salon and the state rooms gave onto an English garden spread between the south facade and the gardens of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es . The dining room was located in the west wing , between two courtyards and a small , oval internal garden , with heating . Two fountains were placed in a gallery between the kitchen and the buffet , a gallery reached through a billiards room and an octagonal hall . On the other side of the main courtyard was a picture gallery and a library , which gave onto Rue de la Bonne-Morue . In the interior , Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau and \u00c9tienne de La Vall\u00e9e Poussin executed the first decorative scheme in Europe to be inspired by the new archaeological discoveries at Pompeii and Herculanum . The painted boiseries were sold in 1850 and may be seen in part at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London . Up until the 19th century , the H\u00f4tel housed the imperial Cercle , then the Cercle de l'Union artistique - the latter held some exhibitions by the Society of Watercolourists here in 1914 .

It was built for the Paris Opera from 1861 to 1875 at the behest of Emperor Napoleon III . Initially referred to as le nouvel Op\u00e9ra de Paris ( the new Paris Opera ) , it soon became known as the Palais Garnier , in acknowledgment of its extraordinary opulence and the architect Charles Garnier 's plans and designs , which are representative of the Napoleon III style . It was the primary theatre of the Paris Opera and its associated Paris Opera Ballet until 1989 , when a new opera house , the Op\u00e9ra Bastille , opened at the Place de la Bastille . The company now uses the Palais Garnier mainly for ballet . The theatre has been a monument historique of France since 1923 . The Palais Garnier has been called probably the most famous opera house in the world , a symbol of Paris like Notre Dame Cathedral , the Louvre , or the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur Basilica . This is at least partly due to its use as the setting for Gaston Leroux 's 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera and , especially , the novel 's subsequent adaptations in films and the popular 1986 musical . Another contributing factor is that among the buildings constructed in Paris during the Second Empire , besides being the most expensive , it has been described as the only one that is unquestionably a masterpiece of the first rank . This opinion is far from unanimous however : the 20th-century French architect Le Corbusier once described it as a lying art and contended that the Garnier movement is a d\u00e9cor of the grave .

The Brussels-Capital Region is located in the central portion of the country and is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community , but is separate from the Flemish Region ( which forms an enclave ) and the Walloon Region . Brussels is the most densely populated and the richest region in Belgium in terms of GDP per capita .

The metropolitan area of Brussels comprises over 2.5 million people , which makes it the largest in Belgium . It is also part of a large conurbation extending towards Ghent , Antwerp , Leuven and Walloon Brabant , home to over 5 million people . Brussels grew from a small rural settlement on the river Senne to become an important city-region in Europe . Since the end of the Second World War , it has been a major centre for international politics and home to numerous international organisations , politicians , diplomats and civil servants . Brussels is the de facto capital of the European Union , as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions , including its administrative-legislative , executive-political , and legislative branches ( though the judicial branch is located in Luxembourg , and the European Parliament meets for a minority of the year in Strasbourg ) [ c ] . Its name is sometimes used metonymically to describe the EU and its institutions . The secretariat of the Benelux and headquarters of NATO are also located in Brussels .
