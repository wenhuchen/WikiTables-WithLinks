  "/wiki/Captain_(land)": "The army rank of captain ( from the French capitaine ) is a commissioned officer rank historically corresponding to the command of a company of soldiers . The rank is also used by some air forces and marine forces . Today , a captain is typically either the commander or second-in-command of a company or artillery battery ( or United States Army cavalry troop or Commonwealth squadron ) . In the Chinese People 's Liberation Army , a captain may also command a company , or be the second-in-command of a battalion . In NATO countries , the rank of captain is described by the code OF-2 and is one rank above an OF-1 ( lieutenant or first lieutenant ) and one below an OF-3 ( major or commandant ) . The rank of captain is generally considered [ by whom ? ] to be the highest rank a soldier can achieve while remaining in the field . In some militaries , such as United States Army and Air Force and the British Army , captain is the entry-level rank for officer candidates possessing a professional degree , namely , most medical professionals ( doctors , pharmacists , dentists ) and lawyers . In the U.S. Army , lawyers who are not already officers at captain rank or above enter as lieutenants during training , and are promoted to the rank of captain after completion of their training if they are in the active component , or after a certain amount of time , usually one year from their date of commission as a lieutenant , for the reserve components . The rank of captain should not be confused with the naval rank of captain or with the UK-influenced air force rank of group captain , both of which are equivalent to the army rank of colonel .",
