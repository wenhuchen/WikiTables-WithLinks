  "intro": "The 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa was an international rugby union tour which took place in South Africa from May to July 2009. The British and Irish Lions played a three-match Test series against South Africa, with matches in Durban, Pretoria and Johannesburg, as well as matches against six provincial teams, and a match against South Africa's A team, the Emerging Springboks. The Lions won all six provincial matches and drew with the Emerging Springboks, 13-13. South Africa won the Test series, defeating the Lions 26-21 in the first Test, and then 28-25 in the second Test. The third Test was won by the Lions 28-9. The highlight of the series was the second Test, which the Lions had led until the 76th minute, when they fell 25-22 behind. Two minutes later, Stephen Jones scored a penalty to draw the sides at 25-25 with only two minutes left. However, two minutes into injury time, Morn\u00e9 Steyn scored a 52-metre penalty kick to win the match 28-25. The tour followed the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand and preceded the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia."
