In the early 7th century , the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabia and created a single Islamic religious polity . Following his death in 632 , his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia , conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory ( from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to modern-day Pakistan in the East ) in a matter of decades . Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun ( 632-661 ) , Umayyad ( 661-750 ) , Abbasid ( 750-1517 ) and Fatimid ( 909-1171 ) caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia , Africa and Europe .",

  "/wiki/Murtada_Ali_Said_Maqram": "A total of 133 Saudi citizens have been held in the United States'Guantanamo Bay detention camps at its naval base in Cuba since January 2002 . Most had been swept up in Afghanistan following the US invasion in the fall of 2001 , and they were classified by the US government as enemy combatants . In addition , a United States citizen , Yaser Esam Hamdi , who was born in Louisiana but moved as a child with his parents to Saudi Arabia , where he also had citizenship , was initially held there . As an American citizen , he was transferred to a military prison brig on the mainland of the United States . His challenge to his detention , without being informed of charges or brought to trial , was a case that reached the United States Supreme Court . In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld ( 2004 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that detainees who are U.S. citizens must have the rights of due process , and the ability to challenge their enemy combatant status before an impartial authority . After this decision , the government made a deal with Hamdi . After he agreed to renounce his US citizenship and observe travel restrictions , in October 2004 Hamdi was deported to Saudi Arabia . He has returned to his family . Following the deaths of two Saudi citizens in custody on June 10 , 2006 , and another on May 30 , 2007 , which the Department of Defense claimed were due to suicides , the Saudi government put pressure on the United States to release its citizens .

  "/wiki/Administrative_Review_Board": "The Administrative Review Board is a United States military body that conducts an annual review of the detainees held by the United States in Camp Delta in the United States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . The purpose of the Board is to review whether the detainees still represent a threat . American President George W. Bush initially called the detainees illegal combatants . But , without a formal announcement of the policy change , the Bush Presidency changed their description to enemy combatant . From July 2004 through March 2005 , military authorities conducted a one-time Combatant Status Review Tribunal for each detainee , to confirm whether they had been properly been classified as an enemy combatant . The Combatant Status Reviews were criticized by human rights workers because the detainees were not entitled to legal counsel , and did not know what allegations they had to defend themselves against , and the detainees had no presumption of innocence . The ARB was created in an attempt to mitigate the harsh results of potentially indefinite detention by allowing an annual review to determine whether the enemy combatant should still be detained . The Combatant Status Reviews determined that 38 detainees were not illegal combatants after all . They determined that the rest of the detainees had been correctly classified as enemy combatants during their original , secret , classifications . The first set of Administrative Reviews took place between December 14 , 2004 and December 23 , 2005 . The Boards met to consider the cases of al 463 eligible detainees .

The capital is Rabat and the largest city is Casablanca . Morocco spans an area of 710,850 km2 ( 274,460 sq mi ) and has a population of over 36 million . Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power ."
