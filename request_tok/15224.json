  "/wiki/Simson_(company)": "Simson was a German company which produced firearms , automobiles , bicycles and motorcycles , and mopeds . Under the Third Reich , the factory was taken from the Jewish Simson family , and was renamed several times under Nazi and later Communist control . The Simson name was reintroduced as a brand name for mopeds produced at the factory in the former German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) . Simson mopeds were then produced in Suhl ( Germany ) until 2002 .",
  "/wiki/Wehrmacht": "The Wehrmacht ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8ve\u02d0\u0250\u032fmaxt ] ( listen ) , lit . defence force ) was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945 . It consisted of the Heer ( army ) , the Kriegsmarine ( navy ) and the Luftwaffe ( air force ) . The designation Wehrmacht replaced the previously used term Reichswehr , and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime 's efforts to rearm Germany to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted . After the Nazi rise to power in 1933 , one of Adolf Hitler 's most overt and audacious moves was to establish the Wehrmacht , a modern offensively-capable armed force , fulfilling the Nazi regime 's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours . This required the reinstatement of conscription , and massive investment and defense spending on the arms industry . The Wehrmacht formed the heart of Germany 's politico-military power . In the early part of the Second World War , the Wehrmacht employed combined arms tactics ( close cover air-support , tanks , and infantry ) to devastating effect in what became known as Blitzkrieg ( lightning war ) . Its campaigns in France ( 1940 ) , the Soviet Union ( 1941 ) , and North Africa ( 1941/42 ) are regarded as acts of boldness . At the same time , the far-flung advances strained the Wehrmacht 's capacity to the breaking point , culminating in the first major defeat in the Battle of Moscow ( 1941 ) ; by late 1942 , Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres . The operational art was no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition , making the Wehrmacht 's weaknesses in strategy , doctrine , and logistics readily apparent . Closely cooperating with the SS and the Einsatzgruppen , the German armed forces committed numerous war crimes , despite later denials and promotion of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht .",
  "/wiki/Rifle_grenade": "A rifle grenade is a grenade that uses a rifle-based launcher to permit a longer effective range than would be possible if the grenade were thrown by hand . The practice of projecting grenades with rifle-mounted launchers was first widely used during World War I and World War II and continues to the present , with the term rifle grenade now encompassing many different types of payloads including high explosive , fragmentation , and anti-tank warheads as well as concussion , smoke , incendiary , and flare missiles . Rifle grenades have largely been supplanted in the infantry fire support role by a combination of grenade launchers ( typically affixed to rifles ) and disposable anti-armor rockets .",
  "/wiki/Panzerfaust": "The Panzerfaust ( German : [ \u02c8pants\u0250\u02ccfa\u028ast ] , lit . armor fist or tank fist , plural : Panzerf\u00e4uste ) was an inexpensive , single shot , recoilless German anti-tank weapon of World War II . It consisted of a small , disposable pre-loaded launch tube firing a high-explosive anti-tank warhead , and was intended to be operated by a single soldier . The Panzerfaust 's direct ancestor was the similar , smaller-warhead Faustpatrone ordnance device . The Panzerfaust was in use from 1943 until the end of the war . The weapon 's concepts played an important part in the development of the later Russian RPG weapon systems such as the RPG-2 . Most notably , the RPG-7 added a sustainer rocket motor to the projectile .",
  "/wiki/Waffen-SS": "The Waffen-SS ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8vafn\u0329\u0294\u025bs\u02cc\u0294\u025bs ] ) was the military branch of the Nazi Party 's SS organisation . Its formations included men from Nazi Germany , along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and unoccupied lands . The Waffen-SS grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II , and served alongside the Heer ( regular army ) , Ordnungspolizei ( uniformed police ) and other security units . Originally , it was under the control of the SS F\u00fchrungshauptamt ( SS operational command office ) beneath Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler . With the start of World War II , tactical control was exercised by the High Command of the Armed Forces ( OKW ) , with some units being subordinated to Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS ( Command Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS ) directly under Himmler 's control . Initially , in keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany , membership was open only to people of Germanic origin ( so-called Aryan ancestry ) . The rules were partially relaxed in 1940 , and later the formation of units composed largely or solely of foreign volunteers and conscripts was authorised . These SS units were made up of men mainly from among the nationals of Nazi-occupied Europe . Despite relaxation of the rules , the Waffen-SS was still based on the racist ideology of Nazism , and ethnic Poles ( who were viewed as subhumans ) were specifically barred from the formations . Members of the Waffen-SS were involved in numerous atrocities . At the post-war Nuremberg trials , the Waffen-SS was judged to be a criminal organisation due to its connection to the Nazi Party and direct involvement in numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity . Former Waffen-SS members , with the exception of conscripts , who comprised about one third of the membership , were denied many of the rights afforded to military veterans .",
  "/wiki/Volksturm": "The Volkssturm ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8f\u0254lks.\u0283t\u028a\u0250\u032fm ] , people 's storm ) was a national militia established by Nazi Germany during the last months of World War II . It was not set up by the German Army , the ground component of the combined German Wehrmacht armed forces , but by the Nazi Party on the orders of Adolf Hitler , and its existence was only officially announced on 16 October 1944 . It was staffed by conscripting males between the ages of 16 and 60 years who were not already serving in some military unit . The Volkssturm comprised one of the final components of the total war promulgated by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels , part of a Nazi endeavor to overcome their enemies ' military strength through force of will .",
  "/wiki/Panzerschreck": "Panzerschreck ( lit . tank fright , tank 's fright or tank 's bane ) was the popular name for the Raketenpanzerb\u00fcchse 54 ( Rocket Anti-armor Rifle model 54 abbreviated to RPzB 54 ) , an 88 mm reusable anti-tank rocket launcher developed by Nazi Germany in World War II . Another earlier , official common name was Ofenrohr ( stove pipe ) . The Panzerschreck was designed as a lightweight infantry anti-tank weapon and was an enlarged copy of the American bazooka . The weapon was shoulder-launched and fired a fin-stabilized rocket with a shaped-charge warhead . It was made in smaller numbers than the Panzerfaust , which was a disposable recoilless gun firing an anti-tank warhead .",
  "/wiki/Bazooka": "Bazooka ( /b\u0259\u02c8zu\u02d0k\u0259/ ) is the common name for a man-portable recoilless anti-tank rocket launcher weapon , widely deployed by the United States Army . Also referred to as the Stovepipe , the innovative bazooka was among the first generation of rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat . Featuring a solid-propellant rocket for propulsion , it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank ( HEAT ) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles , machine gun nests , and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine . The universally-applied nickname arose from the M1 variant 's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a bazooka invented and popularized by 1930s U.S. comedian Bob Burns . During World War II , German armed forces captured several bazookas in early North Africa and Eastern Front encounters and soon reverse engineered their own version , increasing the warhead diameter to 8.8 cm ( among other minor changes ) and widely issuing it as the Raketenpanzerb\u00fcchse Panzerschreck ( Tank scare ) . Near the end of the war , the Japanese developed a similar weapon , the Type 4 70 mm AT Rocket Launcher , which featured a rocket propelled grenade of a different design . The term bazooka still sees informal use as a generic term referring to any ground-to-ground shoulder-fired missile weapon ( mainly rocket propelled grenade launchers or recoilless rifles ) .",
  "/wiki/Solothurn_S-18/1000": "The Solothurn S18-1000 20 mm was a Swiss anti-tank rifle used during the Second World War . It was a variant of the earlier S-18/100 with modifications for a higher muzzle velocity , as well as a larger cartridge size . The more powerful ammunition resulted in significant recoil , which was problematic for the gunner , and its size made portability difficult .",
  "/wiki/20\u00d7138mmB": "The 20\u00d7138mmB cartridge or Long Solothurn is a type of ammunition used mainly for anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons during World War II . The designation means the caliber is 20 mm , the length of the cartridge case is 138 mm and B indicates it is a belted case . The loaded cartridge weighs 10.7 ounces ( 300 g ) .",

  "/wiki/Sturmpistole": "The Sturmpistole ( Assault-Pistol ) was an attempt by Nazi Germany during World War II to create a multi-purpose weapon which could be used by any infantryman . It consisted of a modified Leuchtpistole or flare gun in English which could fire a variety of grenades , including a 600 g ( 1 lb 5 oz ) shaped charge Panzerwurfk\u00f6rper 42 which could penetrate 80 mm of rolled homogeneous armor . The idea was not pursued wholeheartedly , and took second stage to the then current anti-tank rifles and later weapon developments , such as the Panzerfaust and Panzerschreck ."
