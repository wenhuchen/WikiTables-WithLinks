Along the way , it passes through many communities , including the cities of Norwich and Oneonta . Outside of the communities , the route serves largely rural areas of the state and traverses the Catskill Mountains in the state 's Central New York Region . NY 23 crosses the Hudson River at Catskill via the Rip Van Winkle Bridge . Sections of what is now NY 23 were part of unsigned legislative routes as early as 1908 ; however , NY 23 itself was not assigned until 1924 . At the time , the route extended from Oneonta to Massachusetts and followed a slightly different alignment from Cairo to Claverack via Hudson that took the route along modern County Route 23B ( CR 23B ) in eastern Greene County . NY 23 was extended west to Norwich in the mid-1920s and to NY 26 in northwestern Chenango County in 1930 . The route was gradually moved onto its current alignment between Cairo and Claverack in the 1950s and 1960s , and realigned on its western end in 1984 to serve Cortland County .",
  "/wiki/County_Route_10A_(Chenango_County,_New_York)": "New York State Route 319 ( NY 319 ) was a state highway in Chenango County , New York , in the United States .

The route began in the hamlet at an intersection with three county-maintained highways and proceeded eastward through the town of Preston to downtown Norwich , where it terminated at an intersection with NY 12 . What became NY 319 was originally built during the early 19th century as the Norwich and Preston Turnpike , one of many privately maintained turnpikes in the state of New York . The state of New York assumed ownership of the turnpike 's routing in the early 20th century , and the Preston-Norwich state highway was designated as NY 319 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Maintenance of NY 319 was split between the state and the city of Norwich , with the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) handling the part of the route west of the city limits . In 1962 , the New York State Legislature approved a highway maintenance swap that would transfer the state-maintained section of NY 319 to Chenango County when a new alignment was constructed for NY 23 through the northwestern part of the county . The project was completed in July 1984 , at which time the NY 319 designation was completely removed and Chenango County assumed maintenance of the route 's former alignment west of Norwich . The new county road was redesignated County Route 10A ( CR 10A ) .",
