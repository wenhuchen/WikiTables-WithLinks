  "/wiki/Enid_Blyton": "Enid Mary Blyton ( 11 August 1897 - 28 November 1968 ) was an English children 's writer whose books have been among the world 's best-sellers since the 1930s , selling more than 600 million copies . Blyton 's books are still enormously popular , and have been translated into 90 languages . She wrote on a wide range of topics including education , natural history , fantasy , mystery , and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy , Famous Five and Secret Seven series . Her first book , Child Whispers , a 24-page collection of poems , was published in 1922 . Following the commercial success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair ( 1937 ) and The Enchanted Wood ( 1939 ) , Blyton went on to build a literary empire , sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions . Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind : she typed her stories as events unfolded before her . The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers , a charge she vigorously denied . Blyton 's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics , teachers and parents from the 1950s onwards , because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books , particularly the Noddy series . Some libraries and schools banned her works , which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit . Her books have been criticised as being elitist , sexist , racist , xenophobic and at odds with the more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain , but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968 . Blyton felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework , so she encouraged them to support worthy causes . In particular , through the clubs she set up or supported , she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and paediatric charities .",
  "/wiki/The_Famous_Five_(novel_series)": "The Famous Five is a series of children 's adventure novels written by English author Enid Blyton . The first book , Five on a Treasure Island , was published in 1942 . The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children - Julian , Dick , Anne and Georgina ( George ) - and their dog Timmy . The stories take place in the children 's school holidays after they have returned from their respective boarding schools . Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure , often involving criminals or lost treasure . Sometimes the scene is set close to George 's family home at Kirrin Cottage in Dorset , such as the picturesque Kirrin Island , owned by George and her family in Kirrin Bay . George 's own home and various other houses the children visit or stay in are hundreds of years old and often contain secret passages or smugglers ' tunnels . In some books the children go camping in the countryside , on a hike or holiday together elsewhere . However , the settings are almost always rural and enable the children to discover the simple joys of cottages , islands , the English and Welsh countryside and sea shores , as well as an outdoor life of picnics , lemonade , bicycle trips and swimming . [ a ] Blyton intended to write only six or eight books in the series , but owing to their high sales and immense commercial success she went on to write twenty-one full-length Famous Five novels , as well as a number of other series in similar style following groups of children discovering crime on holiday in the countryside . By the end of 1953 more than six million copies had been sold . Today , more than two million copies of the books are sold each year , making them one of the best-selling series for children ever written , with sales totalling over a hundred million .",
  "/wiki/Secret_Seven": "The Secret Seven or Secret Seven Society is a fictional group of child detectives created by Enid Blyton . They appear in one of several adolescent detective series Blyton wrote . The Secret Seven consists of Peter ( the society 's head ) , Janet ( Peter 's sister ) , Jack , Barbara , George , Pam and Colin . Jack 's sister Susie and her best friend Binkie make occasional appearances in the books ; they hate the Secret Seven and delight in playing tricks designed to humiliate them , although this is partly fuelled by their almost obsessive desire to belong to the society . Unlike most other Blyton series , this one takes place during the school term time because the characters go to day schools . Continuing Blyton 's series , Pamela Butchart wrote two new adventures in the series , adding elements of horror .",
  "/wiki/East_Dulwich": "East Dulwich is an area of south East London , England in the London Borough of Southwark . It forms the eastern part of Dulwich , with Peckham to the east and Camberwell to the north . This south London suburb was first developed in the nineteenth century on land owned by Alleyn 's College . It was originally part of the much larger , historic parish of Camberwell , which later became the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell , and included Camberwell , Peckham , Dulwich , Nunhead , and other London districts .",
  "/wiki/Robert_Browning": "Robert Browning ( 7 May 1812 - 12 December 1889 ) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of the dramatic monologue made him one of the foremost Victorian poets . His poems are known for their irony , characterization , dark humour , social commentary , historical settings , and challenging vocabulary and syntax . Browning 's early career began promisingly , but collapsed . The long poems Pauline and Paracelsus received some acclaim , but in 1840 the difficult Sordello , which was seen as wilfully obscure , brought his poetry into disrepute . His reputation took more than a decade to recover , during which time he moved away from the Shelleyan forms of his early period and developed a more personal style . In 1846 , Browning married the older poet Elizabeth Barrett , and went to live in Italy . By the time of her death in 1861 , he had published the crucial collection Men and Women . The collection Dramatis Personae and the book-length epic poem The Ring and the Book followed , and made him a leading British poet . He continued to write prolifically , but his reputation today rests largely on the poetry he wrote in this middle period . When Browning died in 1889 , he was regarded as a sage and philosopher-poet who through his writing had made contributions to Victorian social and political discourse . Unusually for a poet , societies for the study of his work were founded while he was still alive . Such Browning Societies remained common in Britain and the United States until the early 20th century .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_literature": "Victorian literature is literature , mainly written in English , during the reign of Queen Victoria ( 1837-1901 ) ( the Victorian era ) . It was preceded by Romanticism and followed by the Edwardian era ( 1901-1910 ) . While in the preceding Romantic period , poetry had been the conquerors , novels were the emperors of the Victorian period . [ clarification needed ] Charles Dickens ( 1812-1870 ) dominated the first part of Victoria 's reign and most rightly can be called The King of Victorian Literature . [ citation needed ] His first novel , The Pickwick Papers , was published in 1836 , and his last Our Mutual Friend between 1864-5 . William Thackeray 's ( 1811-1863 ) most famous work Vanity Fair appeared in 1848 , and the three Bront\u00eb sisters , Charlotte ( 1816-55 ) , Emily ( 1818-48 ) and Anne ( 1820-49 ) , also published significant works in the 1840s . A major later novel was George Eliot 's ( 1819-80 ) Middlemarch ( 1872 ) , while the major novelist of the later part of Queen Victoria 's reign was Thomas Hardy ( 1840-1928 ) , whose first novel , Under the Greenwood Tree , appeared in 1872 and his last , Jude the Obscure , in 1895 . Robert Browning ( 1812-89 ) and Alfred Tennyson ( 1809-92 ) were Victorian England 's most famous poets , though more recent taste has tended to prefer the poetry of Thomas Hardy , who , though he wrote poetry throughout his life , did not publish a collection until 1898 , as well as that of Gerard Manley Hopkins ( 1844-89 ) , whose poetry was published posthumously in 1918 . Algernon Charles Swinburne ( 1837-1909 ) is also considered an important literary figure of the period , especially his poems and critical writings . Early poetry of W. B. Yeats was also published in Victoria 's reign . With regard to the theatre it was not until the last decades of the nineteenth century that any significant works were produced . This began with Gilbert and Sullivan 's comic operas , from the 1870s , various plays of George Bernard Shaw ( 1856-1950 ) in the 1890s , and Oscar Wilde 's ( 1854-1900 ) The Importance of Being Earnest .",
  "/wiki/Dramatic_verse": "Verse drama is any drama written as verse to be spoken ; another possible general term is poetic drama . For a very long period , verse drama was the dominant form of drama in Europe ( and was also important in non-European cultures ) . Greek tragedy and Racine 's plays are written in verse , as is almost all of Shakespeare 's drama , Ben Jonson , John Fletcher and others like Goethe 's Faust . Verse drama is particularly associated with the seriousness of tragedy , providing an artistic reason to write in this form , as well as the practical one that verse lines are easier for the actors to memorize exactly . In the second half of the twentieth century verse drama fell out of fashion with dramatists writing in English , although the plays of prominent poets , Christopher Fry and T. S. Eliot continued the tradition . Recently , there has been a resurgence in interest in the form of verse drama , particularly those plays in blank verse or iambic pentameter , which endeavor to be in conversation with Shakespeare 's writing styles . King Charles III by Mike Bartlett , written in iambic pentameter , played on the West End and Broadway , as well as being filmed with the original cast for the BBC . Likewise , La Bete by David Hirson , which endeavors to recreate Moliere 's farces in rhyming couplets , enjoyed several prominent productions on both sides of the Atlantic . David Ives , known best for his short , absurdist work , has turned to transladaptation ( his word ) in his later years : translating and updating French farces , such as The School for Lies and The Metromaniacs , both of which premiered in New York City . With the renewed interest in verse drama , theatre companies are looking for new Shakespeare plays to produce . Companies such as Red Bull Theater in New York City ( named after the historical theatre of the same name ) specializes in producing Ives ' transladaptations as well as obscure verse plays . Turn to Flesh Productions , a New York City theatre company founded by verse drama specialist , Emily C. A. Snyder , directly develops new verse plays with living playwrights , with a mission to create vibrant roles for women and those underrepresented in classical art .",

It is located 2.7 miles ( 4.3 km ) southeast of Charing Cross . Camberwell was first a village associated with the church of St Giles and a common of which Goose Green is a remnant . This early parish included the neighbouring hamlets of Peckham , Dulwich , Nunhead , and part of Herne Hill ( the rest of Herne Hill was in the parish of Lambeth ) . Until 1889 , it was part of the county of Surrey . In 1900 the original parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell . In 1965 , most of the Borough of Camberwell was merged into the London Borough of Southwark . To the west , part of both West Dulwich and Herne Hill come under the London Borough of Lambeth .

  "/wiki/Charles_Dickens": "Charles John Huffam Dickens FRSA ( /\u02c8d\u026ak\u026anz/ ; 7 February 1812 - 9 June 1870 ) was an English writer and social critic . He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era . His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the 20th century , critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories are still widely read today . Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed readings extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms . Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense . The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features .",
  "/wiki/Southwark": "Southwark ( /\u02c8s\u028c\u00f0\u0259k/ SUDH-\u0259k ) is a district of Central London and is the north-west of the London Borough of Southwark . Centred 1 1\u20442 miles ( 2.4 km ) east of Charing Cross , it fronts the River Thames and the City of London to the north . It was at the lowest bridging point of the Thames in Roman Britain , providing a crossing from Londinium , and for centuries had the only Thames bridge in the area , until a bridge was built upstream more than 10 miles ( 16 km ) to the west . [ n 1 ] It was a 1295-enfranchised ( nationally represented ) borough in the county of Surrey , apparently created a burh in 886 , containing various parishes by the high medieval period , lightly succumbing to City attempts to constrain its free trade and entertainment . Its entertainment district , in its heyday at the time of Shakespare 's Globe Theatre ( which stood 1599-1642 ) has revived in the form of the Southbank which overspills imperceptibly into the ancient boundaries of Lambeth and commences at the post-1997 reinvention of the original theatre , Shakespeare 's Globe , incorporating other smaller theatre spaces , an exhibition about Shakespeare 's life and work and which neighbours Vinopolis and the London Dungeon . After the 18th-century decline of Southwark 's small wharves , the borough rapidly grew in population and saw the growth of great docks , printing/paper , railways , goods yards , small artisan and other often low-wage industries and Southwark was among many such inner districts to see slum clearance and replacement largely with social housing during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . It is now at an advanced stage of regeneration and has the City Hall offices of the Greater London Authority . At its heart is the area known as Borough , which has an eclectic covered and semi-covered market and numerous food and drink venues as well as the skyscraper The Shard . Another landmark is Southwark Cathedral , a priory then parish church , created a cathedral in 1905 , noted for its Merbecke Choir .

  "/wiki/John_Ruskin": "John Ruskin ( 8 February 1819 - 20 January 1900 ) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era , as well as an art patron , draughtsman , watercolourist , prominent social thinker and philanthropist . He wrote on subjects as varied as geology , architecture , myth , ornithology , literature , education , botany and political economy . His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied . He penned essays and treatises , poetry and lectures , travel guides and manuals , letters and even a fairy tale . He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks , plants , birds , landscapes , and architectural structures and ornamentation . The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively . In all of his writing , he emphasised the connections between nature , art and society . He was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the First World War . After a period of relative decline , his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work . Today , his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism , sustainability and craft . Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of Modern Painters ( 1843 ) , an extended essay in defence of the work of J. M. W. Turner in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is truth to nature . From the 1850s , he championed the Pre-Raphaelites , who were influenced by his ideas .",

  "/wiki/Diarist": "A diary is a record ( originally in handwritten format ) with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period . A personal diary may include a person 's experiences , thoughts , and/or feelings , excluding comments on current events outside the writer 's direct experience . Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist . Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization , including government records ( e.g . Hansard ) , business ledgers , and military records . In British English , the word may also denote a preprinted journal format . A diary is a collection of notes . Today the term is generally employed for personal diaries , normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives . The word journal may be sometimes used for diary , but generally a diary has ( or intends to have ) daily entries , whereas journal-writing can be less frequent . Although a diary may provide information for a memoir , autobiography or biography , it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands , but for the author 's own use . In recent years , however , there is internal evidence in some diaries ( e.g . those of Ned Rorem , Alan Clark , Tony Benn or Simon Gray ) that they are written with eventual publication in mind , with the intention of self-vindication ( pre- or posthumous ) , or simply for profit .",
  "/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft": "Mary Wollstonecraft ( /\u02c8w\u028alst\u0259nkr\u00e6ft/ , also UK : /-kr\u0251\u02d0ft/ ; 27 April 1759 - 10 September 1797 ) was an English writer , philosopher , and advocate of women 's rights . Until the late 20th century , Wollstonecraft 's life , which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships at the time , received more attention than her writing . Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers , and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences . During her brief career , she wrote novels , treatises , a travel narrative , a history of the French Revolution , a conduct book , and a children 's book . Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) , in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men , but appear to be only because they lack education . She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason . After Wollstonecraft 's death , her widower published a Memoir ( 1798 ) of her life , revealing her unorthodox lifestyle , which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century . However , with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century , Wollstonecraft 's advocacy of women 's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important . After two ill-fated affairs , with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay ( by whom she had a daughter , Fanny Imlay ) , Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin , one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement . Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts . She died eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter , Mary Shelley , who would become an accomplished writer and author of Frankenstein .",
  "/wiki/A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Woman": "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman : with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects ( 1792 ) , written by the 18th-century British proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft , is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy . In it , Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should receive a rational education . She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society , claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be companions to their husbands , rather than mere wives . Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage , Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men . Wollstonecraft was prompted to write the Rights of Woman after reading Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord 's 1791 report to the French National Assembly , which stated that women should only receive a domestic education ; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion . Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events ; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it . While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life , such as morality , she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal . Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist , particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her . Although it is commonly assumed now that the Rights of Woman was unfavourably received , this is a modern misconception based on the belief that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of William Godwin 's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1798 ) . The Rights of Woman was actually well received when it was first published in 1792 . One biographer has called it perhaps the most original book of [ Wollstonecraft 's ] century . Wollstonecraft 's work had a profound impact on advocates for women 's rights in the nineteenth century , in particular on the Declaration of Sentiments , the document written at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 that laid out the aims of the suffragette movement in the United States .",
