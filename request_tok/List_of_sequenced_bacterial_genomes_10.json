Its complete genome was sequenced in 2005 by a team of scientists of the Institute for Genomic Research ( TIGR ) According to TIGR evolutionary biologist Jonathan Eisen , C. hydrogenoformans is one of the fastest-growing microbes that can convert water and carbon monoxide to hydrogen . The microbe owes this to the fact that it has at least five different forms of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase .",
  "/wiki/Clostridia": "The Clostridia are a highly polyphyletic class of Firmicutes , including Clostridium and other similar genera . They are distinguished from the Bacilli by lacking aerobic respiration . They are obligate anaerobes and oxygen is toxic to them . Species of the class Clostridia are often but not always Gram-positive ( see Halanaerobium hydrogenoformans ) and have the ability to form spores . Studies show they are not a monophyletic group , and their relationships are not entirely certain . Currently , most are placed in a single order called Clostridiales , but this is not a natural group and is likely to be redefined in the future . Most species of the genus Clostridium are saprophytic organisms that ferment plant polysaccharides and are found in many places in the environment , most notably the soil . However , the genus does contain some human pathogens ( outlined below ) . The toxins produced by certain members of the genus Clostridium are among the most dangerous known . Examples are tetanus toxin ( known as tetanospasmin ) produced by C. tetani and botulinum toxin produced by C. botulinum . Some species have been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis .",

Clostridium difficile ) , also known as Peptoclostridium difficile , C. difficile , or C. diff ( /si\u02d0 d\u026af/ ) , is Gram-positive species of spore-forming bacteria . Clostridioides spp . are anaerobic , motile bacteria , ubiquitous in nature , and especially prevalent in soil . Its vegetative cells are rod-shaped , pleomorphic , and occur in pairs or short chains . Under the microscope , they appear as long , irregular ( often drumstick- or spindle-shaped ) cells with a bulge at their terminal ends ( forms subterminal spores ) . Under Gram staining , C. difficile cells are Gram-positive and show optimum growth on blood agar at human body temperatures in the absence of oxygen . C. difficile is catalase- and superoxide dismutase-negative , and produces two types of toxins : enterotoxin A and cytotoxin B , which disrupts cytoskeleton signal transductions in the host . Under stress conditions , the bacteria produce spores that are able to tolerate extreme conditions that the active bacteria can not tolerate . C. difficile may become established in the human colon ; it is present in 2-5% of the adult population . Sometimes antibiotic therapy for various infections has the adverse effect of disrupting the normal balance of the gut microbiota , in which case C. difficile may opportunistically dominate , causing C. difficile infection ( CDI ) .",

C. perfringens is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the United States , alongside norovirus , Salmonella , Campylobacter , and Staphylococcus aureus . However , it can sometimes be ingested and cause no harm . Infections due to C. perfringens show evidence of tissue necrosis , bacteremia , emphysematous cholecystitis , and gas gangrene , also known as clostridial myonecrosis . The specific name perfringens is derived from the Latin per ( meaning through ) and frango ( burst ) , referring to the disruption of tissue that occurs during gas gangrene . The toxin involved in gas gangrene is \u03b1-toxin , which inserts into the plasma membrane of cells , producing gaps in the membrane that disrupt normal cellular function . C. perfringens can participate in polymicrobial anaerobic infections . It is commonly encountered in infections as a component of the normal flora . In this case , its role in disease is minor . The action of C. perfringens on dead bodies is known to mortuary workers as tissue gas .",
