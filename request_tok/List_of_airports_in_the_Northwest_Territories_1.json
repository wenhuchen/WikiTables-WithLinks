  "/wiki/Thor_Lake": "Thor Lake is a deposit of rare metals located in the Blachford Lake intrusive complex . It is situated 5 km north of the Hearne Channel of Great Slave Lake , Northwest Territories , Canada , approximately 100 kilometers east-southeast of the capital city of Yellowknife . Geologically located on the Canadian Shield it is mostly composed of peralkaline syenite ( granitic rock with low quartz content ) . The Blatchford Lake complex was created in the early Proterozoic , 2.14 Ga ago . The deposit is divided in several sub-structures . In a small zone at the northern edge of the syenite , the T-Zone , minerals like bastn\u00e4site , phenakite and xenotime can be found . Within the Mackenzie mining district , Thor Lake may contain some of the largest deposits of light and heavy rare-earth element ( REE ) ores . The major elements of these ores are europium , terbium , dysprosium , neodymium , gallium , niobium , thorium , zirconium and beryllium . A significant proportion of the REE deposits lie within the boundaries of the Nechalacho Rare Earth Element Project , funded by Avalon Rare Metals . The extraction of these resources could be important for the global REE production , which almost exclusively occurs in China , especially around the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in Bayan Obo .",
