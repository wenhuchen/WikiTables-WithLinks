It is the home of the Indianapolis 500 and the Brickyard 400 , and formerly the home of the United States Grand Prix . It is located on the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road , approximately six miles ( 10 km ) west of Downtown Indianapolis . Constructed in 1909 , it is the second purpose-built , banked oval racing circuit after Brooklands and the first to be called a 'speedway ' . It is the third-oldest permanent automobile race track in the world , behind Brooklands and the Milwaukee Mile . With a permanent seating capacity of 257,325 , it is the highest-capacity sports venue in the world . Considered relatively flat by American standards , the track is a 2.5-mile-long ( 4.0 km ) rectangular oval with dimensions that have remained essentially unchanged since its construction . It has two 5\u20448-mile-long ( 1,000 m ) straightaways , four geometrically identical 1\u20444-mile ( 400 m ) turns , connected by two 1\u20448-mile ( 200 m ) short straightaways , termed short chutes , between turns 1 and 2 , and between turns 3 and 4 . A modern , FIA Grade One infield road course was completed in 2000 , incorporating part of the oval , including the main stretch and the southeast turn , measuring 2.605 miles ( 4.192 km ) . In 2008 , and again in 2014 , the road course layout was modified to accommodate motorcycle racing , as well as to improve competition . Altogether , the current grounds have expanded from an original 320 acres ( 1.3 km2 ) on which the speedway was first built to cover an area of over 559 acres ( 2.3 km2 ) . Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 , it is the only such site to be affiliated with automotive racing history .",

It is the oldest established motorsport world championship . The current top division is known as MotoGP since 2002 when the four-stroke era began . Prior to that , the largest class was 500cc , both of which form a historical continuum as the official World Championship , although all classes have official status . Grand Prix motorcycles are purpose-built racing machines that are generally unavailable for purchase by the general public or able to be ridden legally on public roads . This contrasts with the various production-based categories of racing , such as the Superbike World Championship and the Isle of Man TT Races that feature modified versions of road-going motorcycles available to the public . The championship is currently divided into four classes : Moto Grand Prix , Moto2 , Moto3 and MotoE . The first three classes use four-stroke engines , while the MotoE class ( new in 2019 ) uses electric motors , much like the four-wheeler , single-seater all-electric racing series Formula E. The 2019 MotoGP season comprises 19 Grands Prix , with 12 held in Europe , three in Asia , two in the Americas , and one each in Australia and the Middle East . The most successful rider in Grand Prix history is Giacomo Agostini with 15 titles and 122 race wins .

The event represents one leg of the Triple Crown of Motorsport , other events being the Indianapolis 500 and the Monaco Grand Prix . Unlike fixed distance races where the winner is determined by minimum time , the 24-Hours of Le Mans awards a win to the car that covers the greatest distance in 24 hours . The race is organized by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest ( ACO ) and is held on the Circuit de la Sarthe , which contains a mix of closed public roads and dedicated sections of racing track , in which racing teams must balance the demands of speed with the cars ' ability to run for 24 hours without mechanical failure . Of the 60 cars which qualified for the 2018 race , 41 cars ran the full duration . Since 2012 , the 24 Hours of Le Mans has been a part of the FIA World Endurance Championship . Because of the decision to run a World Endurance Championship super-season in the period May 2018 to June 2019 , the 24 Hours of Le Mans was held twice in the same season ( it was both the second and the last round of the season ) .

However , the Donington Park leaseholders , Donington Ventures Leisure , ran into severe financial problems and went into administration , resulting in the BRDC signing a 17-year deal with Ecclestone to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone .
