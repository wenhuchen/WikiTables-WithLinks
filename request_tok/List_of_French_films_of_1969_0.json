  "/wiki/Army_of_Shadows": "Army of Shadows ( French : L'arm\u00e9e des ombres ) is a 1969 French drama-suspense film written and directed by Jean-Pierre Melville . It is a film adaptation of Joseph Kessel 's 1943 book of the same name , which blends Kessel 's own experiences as a member of the French Resistance with fictionalized versions of other Resistance members . Army of Shadows follows a small group of Resistance fighters as they move between safe houses , work with the Allied militaries , kill informers , and attempt to evade the capture and execution that they know is their most likely fate . While portraying its characters as heroic , the film presents a bleak , unromantic view of the Resistance . At the time of its initial release in France , Army of Shadows was not well received or widely seen . In the wake of the events of May 1968 , French critics denounced the film for its perceived glorification of Charles de Gaulle ; at the time , American art-film programmers took their cues from Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma , which had attacked the film on this basis . Because of this , it was not released in the United States for almost forty years . In the mid-1990s Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma published a reappraisal of the film and Melville 's work in general , leading to its restoration and re-release in 2006 . The film was greeted with critical adulation in the U.S. , appearing in many critics ' year-end top ten lists .",

He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the 1960s French New Wave film movement . During his early career as a film critic , Godard criticized mainstream French cinema 's Tradition of Quality , which emphasized established convention over innovation and experimentation . In response , he and like-minded critics began to make their own films . Many of Godard 's films challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema . In 1964 , Godard described his and his colleagues ' impact : We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV . He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s ; his approach in film conventions , politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave . Along with showing knowledge of film history through homages and references , several of his films expressed his political views ; he was an avid reader of existential and Marxist philosophy . Since the New Wave , his politics have been much less radical and his recent films are about representation and human conflict from a humanist , and a Marxist perspective . In a 2002 Sight & Sound poll , Godard ranked third in the critics ' top ten directors of all time ( which was put together by assembling the directors of the individual films for which the critics voted ) . He is said to have created one of the largest bodies of critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century . He and his work have been central to narrative theory and have challenged both commercial narrative cinema norms and film criticism 's vocabulary .",

She was one of the most renowned and influential opera singers of the 20th century . Many critics praised her bel canto technique , wide-ranging voice and dramatic interpretations . Her repertoire ranged from classical opera seria to the bel canto operas of Donizetti , Bellini and Rossini and , further , to the works of Verdi and Puccini ; and , in her early career , to the music dramas of Wagner . Her musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as La Divina . Born in Manhattan to Greek immigrant parents , she was raised by an overbearing mother who had wanted a son . Maria received her musical education in Greece at age 13 and later established her career in Italy . Forced to deal with the exigencies of 1940s wartime poverty and with near-sightedness that left her nearly blind onstage , she endured struggles and scandal over the course of her career . She turned herself from a heavy woman into a svelte and glamorous one after a mid-career weight loss , which might have contributed to her vocal decline and the premature end of her career . The press exulted in publicizing Callas 's temperamental behavior , her supposed rivalry with Renata Tebaldi and her love affair with Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis . Although her dramatic life and personal tragedy have often overshadowed Callas the artist in the popular press , her artistic achievements were such that Leonard Bernstein called her the Bible of opera and her influence so enduring that , in 2006 , Opera News wrote of her : Nearly thirty years after her death , she 's still the definition of the diva as artist - and still one of classical music 's best-selling vocalists .",
