  "/wiki/Boxing_at_the_1984_Summer_Olympics": "Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place in the Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles , California , United States . The boxing schedule began on July 29 and ended on August 11 . Twelve boxing events were contested with the participation of 354 fighters from 81 countries . A Soviet-led boycott resulted in the withdrawals of the Soviet Union , Cuba , East Germany , Bulgaria and other Eastern Bloc nations from boxing competitions . At the 1980 Summer Olympics , that was impacted by an American-led boycott , Cuban boxers won 10 medals , with 6 of them being gold , and had again been expected to do well . However , the nation withdrew from the games following the announcement of the Soviet boycott . Te\u00f3filo Stevenson , who was going to try for his fourth Olympic gold medal before the boycott was officially announced , had previously defeated Tyrell Biggs twice ( one by knockout ) and Hermenegildo B\u00e1ez had previously defeated Henry Tillman . Soviet Alexander Yagubkin defeated both Biggs and Tillman during the USA-USSR duals . Cuban and Soviet boxers , however , were more seasoned than their American counterparts . While US athletes typically turned pro after the Olympics , while still in their early twenties , Cubans and the Soviets were not allowed to do so and stayed on in the amateurs , participating in multiple Olympic cycles . Journalist George Vecsey remarked after the conclusion of the games that Despite all the flag-waving euphoria in the United States over all those medals in Los Angeles , the Summer Games were a made-in-Disneyland reproduction of the Games because there were no Soviet runners , no Cuban boxers , no East German swimmers . Soviet runners and East German swimmers decades later were revealed to have been part of their respective nations ' state-sponsored doping schemes .",
