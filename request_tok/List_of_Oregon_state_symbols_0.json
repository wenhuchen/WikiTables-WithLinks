It is native to North America and introduced in South America ( Patagonia ) and Europe ( primarily Finland and Karelia ) . In the United States and Canada , the species is often referred to simply as beaver , though this causes some confusion because another distantly related rodent , Aplodontia rufa , is often called the mountain beaver . Other vernacular names , including American beaver and Canadian beaver , distinguish this species from the other extant beaver species , Castor fiber , which is native to Eurasia . The North American beaver is an official animal symbol of Canada and is the official state mammal of Oregon .",
  "/wiki/Rodent": "Rodents ( from Latin Rodere , to gnaw ) are mammals of the order Rodentia , which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws . About 40% of all mammal species are rodents ( 2,277 species ) ; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica . They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats , including human-made environments . Species can be arboreal , fossorial ( burrowing ) , or semiaquatic . Well-known rodents include mice , rats , squirrels , prairie dogs , chipmunks , chinchillas , porcupines , beavers , guinea pigs , hamsters , gerbils and capybaras . Rabbits , hares , and pikas , whose incisors also grow continually , were once included with them , but are now considered to be in a separate order , the Lagomorpha . Nonetheless , Rodentia and Lagomorpha are sister groups , sharing a single common ancestor and forming the clade of Glires . Most rodents are small animals with robust bodies , short limbs , and long tails . They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food , excavate burrows , and defend themselves . Most eat seeds or other plant material , but some have more varied diets . They tend to be social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other . Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy , to polygyny , to promiscuity .",
  "/wiki/Fur": "Fur is a thick growth of hair that covers the skin of many animals . It is a defining characteristic of mammals . It consists of a combination of oily guard hair on top and thick underfur beneath . The guard hair keeps moisture and the underfur acts as an insulating blanket that keeps the animal warm . The fur of mammals has many uses : protection , sensory purposes , waterproofing , and camouflaging , with the primary usage being thermoregulation . The types of hair include definitive , which may be shed after reaching a certain length ; vibrissae , which are sensory hairs and are most commonly whiskers ; pelage , which consists of guard hairs , under-fur , and awn hair ; spines , which are a type of stiff guard hair used for defense in , for example , porcupines ; bristles , which are long hairs usually used in visual signals , such as the mane of a lion ; velli , often called down fur , which insulates newborn mammals ; and wool , which is long , soft , and often curly . :99 Hair length is negligible in thermoregulation , as some tropical mammals , such as sloths , have the same fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation ; and , conversely , other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals . The denseness of fur can increase an animal 's insulation value , and arctic mammals especially have dense fur ; for example , the musk ox has guard hairs measuring 30 cm ( 12 in ) as well as a dense underfur , which forms an airtight coat , allowing them to survive in temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C ( \u221240 \u00b0F ) . :162-163 Some desert mammals , such as camels , use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin , allowing the animal to stay cool ; a camel 's fur may reach 70 \u00b0C ( 158 \u00b0F ) in the summer , but the skin stays at 40 \u00b0C ( 104 \u00b0F ) . :188 Aquatic mammals , conversely , trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry . :162-163",

  "/wiki/Square_dance": "A square dance is a dance for four couples ( eight dancers in total ) arranged in a square , with one couple on each side , facing the middle of the square . Square dances were first documented in 16th-century England but were also quite common in France and throughout Europe . They came to North America with the European settlers and have undergone considerable development there . In some countries and regions , through preservation and repetition , square dances have attained the status of a folk dance . The Western American square dance may be the most widely known form worldwide , possibly due to its association in the 20th century with the romanticized image of the American cowboy . Square dancing is , therefore , strongly associated with the United States . Nineteen U.S. states have designated it as their official state dance . The various square dance movements are based on the steps and figures used in traditional folk dances and social dances from many countries . Some of these traditional dances include English country dance , Caledonians and the quadrille . In most American forms of square dance , the dancers are prompted or cued through a sequence of steps ( square dance choreography ) by a caller to the beat ( and , in some traditions , the phrasing ) of music . In some forms of traditional square dancing , the caller may be one of the dancers or musicians , but in modern Western square dancing the caller will be on stage , giving full attention to directing the dancers . Modern Western square dances are not learned as complete routines ; the dancers learn basic movements , each with its own distinctive call , but do not know in what order they will be called .",

The terms ethnic and traditional are used when it is required to emphasize the cultural roots of the dance . In this sense , nearly all folk dances are ethnic ones . If some dances , such as polka , cross ethnic boundaries and even cross the boundary between folk and ballroom dance , ethnic differences are often considerable enough to mention .",

  "/wiki/Factor_(agent)": "A factor is a type of trader who receives and sells goods on commission ( called factorage ) . A factor is a mercantile fiduciary transacting business in his own name and not disclosing his principal . A factor differs from a commission merchant in that a factor takes possession of goods ( or documents of title representing goods , e.g . a bill of lading ) on consignment , whereas a commission merchant sells goods not in his possession on the basis of samples . Most modern factor business is in the textile field , but factors are also used to a great extent in the shoe , furniture , hardware , and other industries , and the trade areas in which factors operate have increased . In the United Kingdom , most factors fall within the definition of a mercantile agent under the Factors Act 1889 and therefore have the powers of such . A factor has a possessory lien over the consigned goods that covers any claims against the principal arising out of the factor 's activity . A debt factor , whether a person or firm ( factoring company ) , accepts as assignee book debts ( accounts receivable ) as security for short-term loans ; this is known as factoring . The term derives from the Latin for doer , maker , from facit , he/she/it does/makes . Historically , a factor had his seat at a sort of trading post known as a factory .",

The company 's namesake business division is Hudson 's Bay , commonly referred to as The Bay ( La Baie in French ) . After incorporation by English royal charter in 1670 , the company functioned as the de facto government in parts of North America for nearly 200 years until the HBC sold the land it owned ( the entire Hudson Bay drainage basin , known as Rupert 's Land ) to Canada in 1869 as part of The Deed of Surrender , authorised by the Rupert 's Land Act 1868 . During its peak , the company controlled the fur trade throughout much of the English- and later British-controlled North America . By the mid-19th century , the company evolved into a mercantile business selling a wide variety of products from furs to fine homeware in a small number of sales shops ( as opposed to trading posts ) across Canada . These shops were the first step towards the department stores the company owns today . In 2008 , HBC was acquired by NRDC Equity Partners , which also owns the upmarket American department store Lord & Taylor .

  "/wiki/Oregon_Trail": "The Oregon Trail is a 2,170-mile ( 3,490 km ) historic east-west , large-wheeled wagon route and emigrant trail in the United States that connected the Missouri River to valleys in Oregon . The eastern part of the Oregon Trail spanned part of the future state of Kansas , and nearly all of what are now the states of Nebraska and Wyoming . The western half of the trail spanned most of the future states of Idaho and Oregon . The Oregon Trail was laid by fur traders and trappers from about 1811 to 1840 , and was only passable on foot or by horseback . By 1836 , when the first migrant wagon train was organized in Independence , Missouri , a wagon trail had been cleared to Fort Hall , Idaho . Wagon trails were cleared increasingly farther west , and eventually reached all the way to the Willamette Valley in Oregon , at which point what came to be called the Oregon Trail was complete , even as almost annual improvements were made in the form of bridges , cutoffs , ferries , and roads , which made the trip faster and safer . From various starting points in Iowa , Missouri , or Nebraska Territory , the routes converged along the lower Platte River Valley near Fort Kearny , Nebraska Territory , and led to rich farmlands west of the Rocky Mountains . From the early to mid-1830s ( and particularly through the years 1846-1869 ) the Oregon Trail and its many offshoots were used by about 400,000 settlers , farmers , miners , ranchers , and business owners and their families . The eastern half of the trail was also used by travelers on the California Trail ( from 1843 ) , Mormon Trail ( from 1847 ) , and Bozeman Trail ( from 1863 ) , before turning off to their separate destinations . Use of the trail declined as the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 , making the trip west substantially faster , cheaper , and safer . Today , modern highways , such as Interstate 80 and Interstate 84 , follow parts of the same course westward and pass through towns originally established to serve those using the Oregon Trail .",

  "/wiki/Taboo": "A taboo is an implicit prohibition on something ( usually against an utterance or behavior ) based on a cultural sense that it is excessively repulsive or , perhaps , too sacred for ordinary people . Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies . On a comparative basis taboos , for example related to food items , seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group by custom or religion may be perfectly acceptable to another . Taboos are often meant to protect the human individual , but there are numerous other reasons for their existence . An ecological or medical background is apparent in many , including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin . Taboos can help use a resource more efficiently , but when applied to only a subsection of the community they can also serve to suppress a subsection of the community . A taboo acknowledged by a particular group or tribe as part of their ways , aids in the cohesion of the group , helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of belonging . The meaning of the word taboo has been somewhat expanded in the social sciences to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or forbidden based on moral judgment , religious beliefs , or cultural norms . Breaking a taboo is usually considered objectionable by society in general , not merely a subset of a culture .",
  "/wiki/Dam": "A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams . Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation , human consumption , industrial use , aquaculture , and navigability . Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity . A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations . Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water , while other structures such as floodgates or levees ( also known as dikes ) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions . The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan , dating to 3,000 BC . The word dam can be traced back to Middle English , and before that , from Middle Dutch , as seen in the names of many old cities . The first known appearance of dam occurs in 1165 . However , there is one village , Obdam , that is already mentioned in 1120 . The word seems to be related to the Greek word taphos , meaning grave or grave hill . [ citation needed ] So the word should be understood as dike from dug out earth . The names of more than 40 places ( with minor changes ) from the Middle Dutch era ( 1150-1500 CE ) such as Amsterdam ( founded as 'Amstelredam ' in the late 12th century ) and Rotterdam , also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time .",

  "/wiki/Indigenous_(ecology)": "In biogeography , a species is indigenous to a given region or ecosystem if its presence in that region is the result of only natural processes , with no human intervention . The term is equivalent to the concept of native or autochthonous species .

Outside this native range , a species may be introduced by human activity , either intentionally or unintentionally ; it is then referred to as an introduced species within the regions where it was anthropogenically introduced . The notion of indigeneity is often a blurred concept , as is a function of both time and political boundaries . Seen over long periods of time , plants and animals take part in the constant movement of tectonic plates - species appear and may flourish , endure , or become extinct , and their distribution is rarely static or confined to a particular geographic location . An indigenous species in a location is not necessarily also endemic to that location . Endemic species are exclusively found in a particular place . An indigenous species may occur in areas other than the one under consideration . The terms endemic and indigenous also do not imply that an organism necessarily first originated or evolved where it is currently found .",

Small shrubs , less than 2 m ( 6.6 ft ) tall are sometimes termed subshrubs .",
  "/wiki/Pacific_Northwest": "The Pacific Northwest ( PNW ) , sometimes referred to as Cascadia , is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and ( loosely ) by the Rocky Mountains on the east . Though no official boundary exists , the most common conception includes the Canadian province of British Columbia ( BC ) and the U.S. states of Idaho , Oregon , and Washington . Broader conceptions reach north into Southeast Alaska and Yukon , south into northern California , and east to the Continental Divide to include Western Montana and parts of Wyoming . Narrower conceptions may be limited to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains . The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region 's history , culture , geography , society , and other factors . The Northwest Coast is the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest , and the Northwest Plateau ( also commonly known as the Interior in British Columbia and the Inland Northwest in the United States ) is the inland region . The term Pacific Northwest should not be confused with the Northwest Territory ( also known as the Great Northwest , a historical term in the United States ) or the Northwest Territories of Canada . The region 's largest metropolitan areas are Greater Seattle , Washington , with 3.8 million people ; Metro Vancouver , British Columbia , with 2.5 million people ; and Greater Portland , Oregon , with 2.4 million people . The culture of the Pacific Northwest is influenced by the Canada-United States border , which the United States and the United Kingdom established at a time when the region 's inhabitants were composed mostly of indigenous peoples . Two sections of the border - one along the 49th parallel south of British Columbia and one between the Alaska Panhandle and northern British Columbia - have left a great impact on the region . According to Canadian historian Ken Coates , the border has not merely influenced the Pacific Northwest - rather , the region 's history and character have been determined by the boundary .",

The term Northwest Coast or North West Coast is used in anthropology to refer to the groups of Indigenous people residing along the coast of what is now called British Columbia , Washington state , parts of Alaska , Oregon , and Northern California . The term Pacific Northwest is largely used in the American context . At one point the region had the highest population density of a region inhabited by Indigenous peoples in Canada .",

The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell ; its name comes from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ( mei\u014dn , less ) and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ( kainos , new ) and means less recent because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene . The Miocene is preceded by the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene . As the earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene , the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages . The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regionally defined boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch . The apes first evolved , arose , and diversified during the early Miocene ( Aquitanian and Burdigalian stages ) , becoming widespread in the Old World . By the end of this epoch and the start of the following one , the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path during the final Messinian stage ( 7.5-5.3 Ma ) of the Miocene . As in the Oligocene before it , grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent . In the seas of the Miocene , kelp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of Earth 's most productive ecosystems . The plants and animals of the Miocene were recognizably modern . Mammals and birds were well-established . Whales , pinnipeds , and kelp spread .",

  "/wiki/Orchard": "An orchard is an intentional planting of trees or shrubs that is maintained for food production . Orchards comprise fruit- or nut-producing trees which are generally grown for commercial production . Orchards are also sometimes a feature of large gardens , where they serve an aesthetic as well as a productive purpose . A fruit garden is generally synonymous with an orchard , although it is set on a smaller non-commercial scale and may emphasize berry shrubs in preference to fruit trees . Most temperate-zone orchards are laid out in a regular grid , with a grazed or mown grass or bare soil base that makes maintenance and fruit gathering easy . Most orchards are planted for a single variety of fruit . While the importance of introducing biodiversity is recognized in forest plantations , it would seem to be beneficial to introduce some genetic diversity in orchard plantations as well by interspersing other trees through the orchard . Genetic diversity in an orchard would provide resilience to pests and diseases just as in forests . Orchards are sometimes concentrated near bodies of water where climatic extremes are moderated and blossom time is retarded until frost danger is past .",

Rather than referring to a particular mineral with a specific chemical composition , plagioclase is a continuous solid solution series , more properly known as the plagioclase feldspar series ( from the Ancient Greek for oblique fracture , in reference to its two cleavage angles ) . This was first shown by the German mineralogist Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel ( 1796-1872 ) in 1826 . The series ranges from albite to anorthite endmembers ( with respective compositions NaAlSi3O8 to CaAl2Si2O8 ) , where sodium and calcium atoms can substitute for each other in the mineral 's crystal lattice structure . Plagioclase in hand samples is often identified by its polysynthetic crystal twinning or 'record-groove ' effect . Plagioclase is a major constituent mineral in the Earth 's crust , and is consequently an important diagnostic tool in petrology for identifying the composition , origin and evolution of igneous rocks . Plagioclase is also a major constituent of rock in the highlands of the Earth 's moon . Analysis of thermal emission spectra from the surface of Mars suggests that plagioclase is the most abundant mineral in the crust of Mars .",

Yeasts are unicellular organisms that evolved from multicellular ancestors , with some species having the ability to develop multicellular characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells known as pseudohyphae or false hyphae . Yeast sizes vary greatly , depending on species and environment , typically measuring 3-4 \u00b5m in diameter , although some yeasts can grow to 40 \u00b5m in size . Most yeasts reproduce asexually by mitosis , and many do so by the asymmetric division process known as budding . With their single-celled growth habit , yeasts can be contrasted with molds , which grow hyphae . Fungal species that can take both forms ( depending on temperature or other conditions ) are called dimorphic fungi .

  "/wiki/Fungus": "A fungus ( plural : fungi or funguses ) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds , as well as the more familiar mushrooms . These organisms are classified as a kingdom , fungi , which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals . A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants , bacteria , and some protists is chitin in their cell walls . Similar to animals , fungi are heterotrophs ; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules , typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment . Fungi do not photosynthesize . Growth is their means of mobility , except for spores ( a few of which are flagellated ) , which may travel through the air or water . Fungi are the principal decomposers in ecological systems . These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms , named the Eumycota ( true fungi or Eumycetes ) , which share a common ancestor ( form a monophyletic group ) , an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics . This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar myxomycetes ( slime molds ) and oomycetes ( water molds ) . The discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi is known as mycology ( from the Greek \u03bc\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 mykes , mushroom ) . In the past , mycology was regarded as a branch of botany , although it is now known fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants . Abundant worldwide , most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures , and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter .",

  "/wiki/Hazelnut": "The hazelnut is the nut of the hazel and therefore includes any of the nuts deriving from species of the genus Corylus , especially the nuts of the species Corylus avellana . It also is known as cobnut or filbert nut according to species . A cob is roughly spherical to oval , about 15-25 mm ( 0.59-0.98 in ) long and 10-15 mm ( 0.39-0.59 in ) in diameter , with an outer fibrous husk surrounding a smooth shell . A filbert is more elongated , being about twice as long as its diameter . The nut falls out of the husk when ripe , about 7 to 8 months after pollination . The kernel of the seed is edible and used raw or roasted , or ground into a paste . The seed has a thin , dark brown skin , which sometimes is removed before cooking . Hazelnuts are used in confectionery to make praline , and also used in combination with chocolate for chocolate truffles and products such as Cadbury chocolate bars , Nutella and Frangelico liqueur . Hazelnut oil , pressed from hazelnuts , is strongly flavoured and used as a cooking oil . Turkey is the world 's largest producer of hazelnuts . Hazelnuts are rich in protein , monounsaturated fat , vitamin E , manganese , and numerous other essential nutrients ( nutrition table below ) .",
  "/wiki/Nut_(fruit)": "A nut is a fruit composed of an inedible hard shell and a seed , which is generally edible . In general usage , a wide variety of dried seeds are called nuts , but in a botanical context nut implies that the shell does not open to release the seed ( indehiscent ) . The translation of nut in certain languages frequently requires paraphrases , as the word is ambiguous .",
  "/wiki/Willamette_Valley": "The Willamette Valley ( /w\u026a\u02c8l\u00e6m\u026at/ ) is a 150-mile ( 240 km ) long valley in Oregon , in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States . The Willamette River flows the entire length of the valley , and it is surrounded by mountains on three sides - the Cascade Range to the east , the Oregon Coast Range to the west , and the Calapooya Mountains to the south . The valley is synonymous with the cultural and political heart of Oregon , and is home to approximately 70 percent of its population including the six largest cities in the state : Eugene , Salem , Corvallis , Hillsboro and Newberg/McMinnville . The valley 's numerous waterways , particularly the Willamette River , are vital to the economy of Oregon , as they continuously deposit highly fertile alluvial soils across its broad , flat plain . A massively productive agricultural area , the valley was widely publicized in the 1820s as a promised land of flowing milk and honey . Throughout the 19th century it was the destination of choice for the oxen-drawn wagon trains of emigrants who made the perilous journey along the Oregon Trail . Today the valley is often considered synonymous with Oregon Wine Country , as it contains more than 19,000 acres ( 7,700 ha ) of vineyards and 500+ wineries .",
  "/wiki/Thunderegg": "A thunderegg ( or thunder egg ) is a nodule-like rock , similar to a filled geode , that is formed within rhyolitic volcanic ash layers . Thundereggs are rough spheres , most about the size of a baseball - though they can range from a little more than a centimeter to over a meter across . They usually contain centres of chalcedony which may have been fractured followed by deposition of agate , jasper or opal , either uniquely or in combination . Also frequently encountered are quartz and gypsum crystals , as well as various other mineral growths and inclusions . Thundereggs usually look like ordinary rocks on the outside , but slicing them in half and polishing them may reveal intricate patterns and colours . A characteristic feature of thundereggs is that ( like other agates ) the individual beds they come from can vary in appearance , though they can maintain a certain specific identity within them . Thunderegg is not synonymous with either geode or agate . A geode is a simple term for a rock with a hollow in it , often with crystal formation/growth . A thunderegg on the other hand is a specific geological structure . A thunderegg may be referred to as a geode if it has a hollow in it , but not all geodes are thundereggs because there are many different ways for a hollow to form . Similarly , a thunderegg is just one of the forms that agate can assume .",
  "/wiki/Geological": "Geology ( from the Ancient Greek \u03b3\u1fc6 , g\u0113 ( earth ) and -\u03bbo\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 , -logia , ( study of , discourse ) ) is an earth science concerned with the solid Earth , the rocks of which it is composed , and the processes by which they change over time . Geology can also include the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon . Modern geology significantly overlaps all other earth sciences , including hydrology and the atmospheric sciences , and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated earth system science and planetary science .",
  "/wiki/Geode": "Geodes ( derived from the Greek word \u03b3\u03b5\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 meaning Earth-like ) are geological secondary formations within sedimentary and volcanic rocks . Geodes are hollow , vaguely circular rocks , in which masses of mineral matter ( which may include crystals ) are secluded . The crystals are formed by the filling of vesicles in volcanic and sub-volcanic rocks by minerals deposited from hydrothermal fluids ; or by the dissolution of syn-genetic concretions and partial filling by the same , or other , minerals precipitated from water , groundwater or hydrothermal fluids .",
