  "/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration": "The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration ) was an American New Deal agency , employing millions of job-seekers ( mostly unskilled men ) to carry out public works projects , including the construction of public buildings and roads . It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing . The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority , which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power .",

There are 4-H organizations in over 50 countries ; the organization and administration varies from country to country . Each of these programs operates independently but cooperatively through international exchanges , global education programs , and communications . [ citation needed ] The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship , leadership , responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach .

  "/wiki/Railway_turntable": "In rail terminology , a railway turntable or wheelhouse is a device for turning railway rolling stock , usually locomotives , so that they can be moved back in the direction from which they came . This is especially true in areas where economic considerations or a lack of sufficient space have served to weigh against the construction of a turnaround wye . In the case of steam locomotives , railways needed a way to turn the locomotives around for return trips as their controls were often not configured for extended periods of running in reverse and in many locomotives the top speed was lower in reverse motion . In the case of diesel locomotives , though most can be operated in either direction , they are treated as having front ends and rear ends ( often determined by reference to the location of the crew cab ) . When operated as a single unit , the railway company often prefers , or requires , that a diesel locomotive is run front end first . When operated as part of a multiple unit locomotive consist , the locomotives can be arranged so that the consist can be operated front end first no matter which direction the consist is pointed . Turntables were also used to turn observation cars so that their windowed lounge ends faced toward the rear of the train .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/Terracotta": "Terracotta , terra cotta or terra-cotta ( pronounced [ \u02cct\u025brra\u02c8k\u0254tta ] ; Italian : baked earth , from the Latin terra cocta ) , a type of earthenware , is a clay-based unglazed or glazed ceramic , where the fired body is porous . Terracotta is the term normally used for sculpture made in earthenware , and also for various practical uses including vessels ( notably flower pots ) , water and waste water pipes , roofing tiles , bricks , and surface embellishment in building construction . The term is also used to refer to the natural brownish orange color of most terracotta , which varies considerably . [ citation needed ] This article covers the senses of terracotta as a medium in sculpture , as in the Terracotta Army and Greek terracotta figurines , and architectural decoration . Asian and European sculpture in porcelain is not covered . Glazed architectural terracotta and its unglazed version as exterior surfaces for buildings were used in Asia for some centuries before becoming popular in the West in the 19th century . Architectural terracotta can also refer to decorated ceramic elements such as antefixes and revetments , which made a large contribution to the appearance of temples and other buildings in the classical architecture of Europe , as well as in the Ancient Near East . [ citation needed ] In archaeology and art history , terracotta is often used to describe objects such as figurines not made on a potter 's wheel . Vessels and other objects that are or might be made on a wheel from the same material are called earthenware pottery ; the choice of term depends on the type of object rather than the material or firing technique . Unglazed pieces , and those made for building construction and industry , are also more likely to be referred to as terracotta , whereas tableware and other vessels are called earthenware ( though sometimes terracotta if unglazed ) , or by a more precise term such as faience .

  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places ."
