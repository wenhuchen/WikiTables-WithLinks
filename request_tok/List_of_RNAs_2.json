  "/wiki/Antisense_RNA": "Antisense RNA ( asRNA ) , also referred to as antisense transcript , natural antisense transcript ( NAT ) or antisense oligonucleotide , is a single stranded RNA that is complementary to a protein coding messenger RNA ( mRNA ) with which it hybridizes , and thereby blocks its translation into protein . asRNAs ( which occur naturally ) have been found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes , antisense transcripts can be classified into short ( < 200 nucleotides ) and long ( > 200 nucleotides ) non-coding RNAs ( ncRNAs ) . The primary function of asRNA is regulating gene expression . asRNAs may also be produced synthetically and have found wide spread use as research tools for gene knockdown . They may also have therapeutic applications .",
  "/wiki/Cis-natural_antisense_transcript": "Natural antisense transcripts ( NATs ) are a group of RNAs encoded within a cell that have transcript complementarity to other RNA transcripts . They have been identified in multiple eukaryotes , including humans , mice , yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana . This class of RNAs includes both protein-coding and non-coding RNAs . Current evidence has suggested a variety of regulatory roles for NATs , such as RNA interference ( RNAi ) , alternative splicing , genomic imprinting , and X-chromosome inactivation . NATs are broadly grouped into two categories based on whether they act in cis or in trans . Trans-NATs are transcribed from a different location than their targets and usually have complementarity to multiple transcripts with some mismatches . MicroRNAs ( miRNA ) are an example of trans-NATs that can target multiple transcripts with a few mismatches . Cis-natural antisense transcripts ( cis-NATs ) on the other hand are transcribed from the same genomic locus as their target but from the opposite DNA strand and form perfect pairs .",
  "/wiki/CRISPR": "CRISPR ( /\u02c8kr\u026asp\u0259r/ ) ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea . These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the prokaryote . They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections . Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral ( i.e . anti-phage ) defense system of prokaryotes . Cas9 ( or CRISPR-associated protein 9 ) is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence . Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms . This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research , development of biotechnology products , and treatment of diseases .",
  "/wiki/Long_noncoding_RNA": "Long non-coding RNAs ( long ncRNAs , lncRNA ) are a type of RNA , defined as being transcripts with lengths exceeding 200 nucleotides that are not translated into protein . This somewhat arbitrary limit distinguishes long ncRNAs from small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs ( miRNAs ) , small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) , Piwi-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs ) , small nucleolar RNAs ( snoRNAs ) , and other short RNAs . Long intervening/intergenic noncoding RNAs ( lincRNAs ) are sequences of lncRNA which do not overlap protein-coding genes .",
  "/wiki/MicroRNA": "A microRNA ( abbreviated miRNA ) is a small non-coding RNA molecule ( containing about 22 nucleotides ) found in plants , animals and some viruses , that functions in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression . miRNAs function via base-pairing with complementary sequences within mRNA molecules . As a result , these mRNA molecules are silenced , by one or more of the following processes : ( 1 ) Cleavage of the mRNA strand into two pieces , ( 2 ) Destabilization of the mRNA through shortening of its poly ( A ) tail , and ( 3 ) Less efficient translation of the mRNA into proteins by ribosomes . miRNAs resemble the small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) of the RNA interference ( RNAi ) pathway , except miRNAs derive from regions of RNA transcripts that fold back on themselves to form short hairpins , whereas siRNAs derive from longer regions of double-stranded RNA . The human genome may encode over 1900 miRNAs , although more recent analysis indicates that the number is closer to 600. miRNAs are abundant in many mammalian cell types and appear to target about 60% of the genes of humans and other mammals . Many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved , which implies that they have important biological functions . For example , 90 families of miRNAs have been conserved since at least the common ancestor of mammals and fish , and most of these conserved miRNAs have important functions , as shown by studies in which genes for one or more members of a family have been knocked out in mice .",
  "/wiki/Piwi-interacting_RNA": "Piwi-interacting RNA ( piRNA ) is the largest class of small non-coding RNA molecules expressed in animal cells . piRNAs form RNA-protein complexes through interactions with piwi-subfamily Argonaute proteins . These piRNA complexes are mostly involved in the epigenetic and post-transcriptional silencing of transposons and other repeat-derived transcripts , but can also be involved in the regulation of other genetic elements in germ line cells . piRNAs are mostly created from loci that function as transposon traps and provide an RNA-mediated adaptive immunity against transposon expansions and invasions . They are distinct from microRNA ( miRNA ) in size ( 26-31 nt rather than 21-24 nt ) , lack of sequence conservation , increased complexity , and independence of Dicer for biogenesis at least in animals . ( Plant Dcl2 may play a role in rasi/piRNA biogenesis . ) Double-stranded RNAs silencing repeat elements , then known as repeat associated small interfering RNAs ( rasiRNAs ) , were proposed in Drosophilia in 2001 . In 2008 , it was still unclear how piRNAs are generated , but potential methods had been suggested , and it was certain their biogenesis pathway is distinct from miRNA and siRNA , while rasiRNAs are a piRNA subspecies .",
  "/wiki/Animal": "Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia . With few exceptions , animals consume organic material , breathe oxygen , are able to move , can reproduce sexually , and grow from a hollow sphere of cells , the blastula , during embryonic development . Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described - of which around 1 million are insects - but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total . Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres ( 110 ft ) . They have complex interactions with each other and their environments , forming intricate food webs . The kingdom Animalia includes humans , but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals . The scientific study of animals is known as zoology . Most living animal species are in the Bilateria , a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan . The Bilateria include the protostomes - in which many groups of invertebrates are found , such as nematodes , arthropods , and molluscs - and the deuterostomes , containing both the echinoderms as well as the chordates , the latter containing the vertebrates . Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian . Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion , which began around 542 million years ago . 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified ; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago .",
  "/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA": "Small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , sometimes known as short interfering RNA or silencing RNA , is a class of double-stranded RNA non-coding RNA molecules , 20-25 base pairs in length , similar to miRNA , and operating within the RNA interference ( RNAi ) pathway . It interferes with the expression of specific genes with complementary nucleotide sequences by degrading mRNA after transcription , preventing translation .",
  "/wiki/Eukaryote": "Eukaryotes ( /ju\u02d0\u02c8k\u00e6rio\u028at , -\u0259t/ ) are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within membranes , unlike prokaryotes ( Bacteria and Archaea ) , which have no membrane-bound organelles . Eukaryotes belong to the domain Eukaryota or Eukarya . Their name comes from the Greek \u03b5\u1f56 ( eu , well or true ) and \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd ( karyon , nut or kernel ) . Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus , and in addition , some cells of plants and algae contain chloroplasts . Unlike unicellular archaea and bacteria , eukaryotes may also be multicellular and include organisms consisting of many cell types forming different kinds of tissue . Animals and plants are the most familiar eukaryotes . Eukaryotes can reproduce both asexually through mitosis and sexually through meiosis and gamete fusion . In mitosis , one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells . In meiosis , DNA replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four haploid daughter cells . These act as sex cells ( gametes ) . Each gamete has just one set of chromosomes , each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental chromosomes resulting from genetic recombination during meiosis . [ citation needed ] The domain Eukaryota is monophyletic and makes up one of the domains of life in the three-domain system .",
  "/wiki/Short_hairpin_RNA": "A short hairpin RNA or small hairpin RNA ( shRNA/Hairpin Vector ) is an artificial RNA molecule with a tight hairpin turn that can be used to silence target gene expression via RNA interference ( RNAi ) . Expression of shRNA in cells is typically accomplished by delivery of plasmids or through viral or bacterial vectors . shRNA is an advantageous mediator of RNAi in that it has a relatively low rate of degradation and turnover . However , it requires use of an expression vector , which has the potential to cause side effects in medicinal applications . The promoter choice is essential to achieve robust shRNA expression . At first , polymerase III promoters such as U6 and H1 were used ; however , these promoters lack spatial and temporal control . As such , there has been a shift to using polymerase II promoters to regulate shRNA expression .",
  "/wiki/Trans-acting_siRNA": "Trans-acting siRNA ( abbreviated ta-siRNA or tasiRNA ) are a class of small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) that repress gene expression through post-transcriptional gene silencing in land plants . Precursor transcripts from TAS loci are polyadenylated and converted to double-stranded RNA , and are then processed into 21-nucleotide-long RNA duplexes with overhangs . These segments are incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC ) and direct the sequence-specific cleavage of target mRNA . Ta-siRNAs are classified as siRNA because they arise from double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) .",
  "/wiki/Land_plants": "The Embryophyta , or land plants , are the most familiar group of green plants that form vegetation on earth . Embryophyta is a clade within the Phragmoplastophyta , a larger clade that also includes several green algae groups ( including the Charophyceae and Coleochaetales ) , and within this large clade the embryophytes are sister to the Zygnematophyceae/Mesotaeniaceae and consist of the bryophytes plus the polysporangiophytes . Living embryophytes therefore include hornworts , liverworts , mosses , ferns , lycophytes , gymnosperms and flowering plants . The Embryophyta are informally called land plants because they live primarily in terrestrial habitats , while the related green algae are primarily aquatic . Embryophytes are complex multicellular eukaryotes with specialized reproductive organs . The name derives from their innovative characteristic of nurturing the young embryo sporophyte during the early stages of its multicellular development within the tissues of the parent gametophyte . With very few exceptions , embryophytes obtain their energy by photosynthesis , that is by using the energy of sunlight to synthesize their food from carbon dioxide and water .",

They should not be confused with the Tephritidae , a related family , which are also called fruit flies ( sometimes referred to as true fruit flies ) ; tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe fruit , with many species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests , especially the Mediterranean fruit fly . One species of Drosophila in particular , D. melanogaster , has been heavily used in research in genetics and is a common model organism in developmental biology . The terms fruit fly and Drosophila are often used synonymously with D. melanogaster in modern biological literature . The entire genus , however , contains more than 1,500 species and is very diverse in appearance , behavior , and breeding habitat .",

  "/wiki/Enhancer_RNAs": "Enhancer RNAs ( eRNAs ) represent a class of relatively short non-coding RNA molecules ( 50-2000 nucleotides ) transcribed from the DNA sequence of enhancer regions . They were first detected in 2010 through the use of genome-wide techniques such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq . eRNAs can be subdivided into two main classes : 1D eRNAs and 2D eRNAs , which differ primarily in terms of their size , polyadenylation state , and transcriptional directionality . The expression of a given eRNA seems to correlate with the activity of its corresponding enhancer in a context-dependent fashion . Increasing evidence suggests that eRNAs actively play a role in transcriptional regulation in cis and in trans , and while their mechanisms of action remain unclear , a few models have been proposed ."
