  "/wiki/Science_fiction_film": "Science fiction film ( or sci-fi film ) is a genre that uses speculative , fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science , such as extraterrestrial lifeforms , alien worlds , extrasensory perception and time travel , along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft , robots , cyborgs , interstellar travel or other technologies . Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues , and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition . In many cases , tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held . The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema , when Georges Melies ' A Trip to the Moon ( 1902 ) employed trick photography effects . The next major example in the genre was the film Metropolis ( 1927 ) . From the 1930s to the 1950s , the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B movies . After Stanley Kubrick 's landmark 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) , the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously . In the late 1970s , big-budget science fiction films filled with special effects became popular with audiences after the success of Star Wars and paved the way for the blockbuster hits of subsequent decades .",

  "/wiki/3-D_film": "A three-dimensional stereoscopic film ( also known as three-dimensional film , 3D film or S3D film ) is a motion picture that enhances the illusion of depth perception , hence adding a third dimension . The most common approach to the production of 3D films is derived from stereoscopic photography . In this approach , a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives ( or computer-generated imagery generates the two perspectives in post-production ) , and special projection hardware or eyewear is used to limit the visibility of each image to the viewer 's left or right eye only . 3D films are not limited to theatrical releases ; television broadcasts and direct-to-video films have also incorporated similar methods , especially since the advent of 3D television and Blu-ray 3D . 3D films have existed in some form since 1915 , but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film , and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business . Nonetheless , 3D films were prominently featured in the 1950s in American cinema , and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by IMAX high-end theaters and Disney-themed venues . 3D films became increasingly successful throughout the 2000s , peaking with the success of 3D presentations of Avatar in December 2009 , after which 3D films again decreased in popularity . Certain directors have also taken more experimental approaches to 3D filmmaking , most notably celebrated auteur Jean-Luc Godard in his films 3X3D and Goodbye to Language .",
