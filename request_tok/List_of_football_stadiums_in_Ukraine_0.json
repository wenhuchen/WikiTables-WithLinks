Its population in July 2015 was 2,887,974 ( though higher estimated numbers have been cited in the press ) , making Kiev the 6th-most populous city in Europe . Kiev is an important industrial , scientific , educational and cultural center of Eastern Europe . It is home to many high-tech industries , higher education institutions , and historical landmarks . The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure , including the Kiev Metro . The city 's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi , one of its four legendary founders . During its history , Kiev , one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe , passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity . The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century . A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople , Kiev was a tributary of the Khazars , until its capture by the Varangians ( Vikings ) in the mid-9th century . Under Varangian rule , the city became a capital of the Kievan Rus ' , the first East Slavic state .
