  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_birds": "Below is a list of U.S. state birds as designated by each state 's legislature , as well as the District of Columbia 's state bird . The list also contains U.S. territory birds as designated by each territory 's legislature . The selection of state birds began in 1927 , when the legislatures for Alabama , Florida , Maine , Missouri , Oregon , Texas and Wyoming selected their state birds . The last state to choose its bird was Arizona in 1973 . Alaska , California , and South Dakota permit hunting of their state birds . Pennsylvania has adopted a state game bird but not a state bird , while Alabama , Georgia , Massachusetts , Missouri , Oklahoma , South Carolina , and Tennessee have designated an additional state game bird for the purpose of hunting . The northern cardinal is the state bird of seven states , followed by the western meadowlark as the state bird of six states . Several states have extinct official animals , such as state dinosaurs in addition to state insects , state butterflies , state mammals and state reptiles . The District of Columbia designated a district bird in 1938 . Each of the five inhabited territories of the United States has a designated territorial bird ( except for American Samoa ) .",
  "/wiki/Northern_mockingbird": "The northern mockingbird ( Mimus polyglottos ) is the only mockingbird commonly found in North America . This bird is mainly a permanent resident , but northern birds may move south during harsh weather . This species has rarely been observed in Europe . This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Natur\u00e6 in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos . The northern mockingbird is known for its mimicking ability , as reflected by the meaning of its scientific name , many-tongued mimic . The northern mockingbird has gray to brown upper feathers and a paler belly . Its tail and wings have white patches which are visible in flight . The northern mockingbird is an omnivore , eating both insects and fruits . It is often found in open areas and forest edges but forages in grassy land . The northern mockingbird breeds in southeastern Canada , the United States , northern Mexico , the Bahamas , the Cayman Islands and the Greater Antilles . It is replaced further south by its closest living relative , the tropical mockingbird . The Socorro mockingbird , an endangered species , is also closely related , contrary to previous opinion .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_butterflies": "State insects are designated by 48 individual states of the fifty United States . Some states have more than one designated insect , or have multiple categories ( e.g. , state insect and state butterfly , etc. ) . More than half of the insects chosen are not native to North America , because of the inclusion of three European species ( European honey bee , European mantis , and 7-spotted ladybird ) , each having been chosen by multiple states .",
  "/wiki/Papilio_troilus": "Papilio troilus , the spicebush swallowtail or green-clouded butterfly , is a common black swallowtail butterfly found in North America . It has two subspecies , Papilio troilus troilus and Papilio troilus ilioneus , the latter found mainly in the Florida peninsula . The spicebush swallowtail derives its name from its most common host plant , the spicebush , members of the genus Lindera . The family to which spicebush swallowtails belong , Papilionidae , or swallowtails , include the largest butterflies in the world . The swallowtails are unique in that even while feeding , they continue to flutter their wings . Unlike other swallowtail butterflies , spicebushes fly low to the ground instead of at great heights .",

  "/wiki/Largemouth_bass": "The largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) is a carnivorous freshwater gamefish in the Centrarchidae ( sunfish ) family , a species of black bass native to the eastern and central United States and northern Mexico , but widely introduced elsewhere . It is known by a variety of regional names , such as the widemouth bass , bigmouth bass , black bass , bucketmouth , largies , Potter 's fish , Florida bass , Florida largemouth , green bass , bucketmouth bass , Green trout , gilsdorf bass , Oswego bass , southern largemouth and ( paradoxically ) northern largemouth , LMB . The largemouth bass is the state fish of Georgia and Mississippi , and the state freshwater fish of Florida and Alabama .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_fossils": "Most American states have made a state fossil designation , in many cases during the 1980s . It is common to designate one species in which fossilization has occurred , rather than a single specimen , or a category of fossils not limited to a single species . Some states that lack an explicit state fossil have nevertheless singled out a fossil for formal designation as a state dinosaur , rock , gem or stone .",
  "/wiki/Basilosaurus": "Basilosaurus ( meaning king lizard ) is a genus of large , predatory , prehistoric archaeocete whale from the late Eocene , approximately 41.3 to 33.9 million years ago ( mya ) . First described in 1834 , it was the first archaeocete and prehistoric whale known to science . The first fossils were discovered along the Gulf Coast of the United States , along with a few fossils in the eastern U.S. , attributed to the type species B. cetoides . They were originally thought to be of a giant reptile , hence the suffix -saurus , Ancient Greek for lizard . The animal was later found to be an early marine mammal , which prompted attempts at renaming the creature , which failed as zoological nomenclature dictates using the original name given . Fossils were later found of the second species , B. isis , in 1904 in North Africa , more specifically the countries of Egypt , Jordan , Tunisia and Morocco . Basilosaurus has a possible record in New Zealand and Seymour Island in Antarctica . [ unreliable source ? ] Basilosaurus is considered to have been common in the Tethys sea . It was one of the largest , if not the largest , animals of the Paleogene . It was the top predator of its environment , preying on sharks , large fish and other marine mammals , namely the dolphin-like Dorudon , which seems to have been their predominant food source . Basilosaurus was at one point a wastebasket taxon , before the genus slowly started getting reevaluated , with many species of different Eocene cetacean being assigned to the genus in the past , however they are invalid or have been reclassified under a new or different genus , leaving only 2 confirmed species .",
  "/wiki/Zygorhiza": "Zygorhiza ( Yoke-Root ) is an extinct genus of basilosaurid early whale known from the Late Eocene ( Priabonian , 38-34 Ma ) of Louisiana , Alabama , and Mississippi , United States , and the Bortonian ( 43-37 Ma on the New Zealand geologic time scale ) to the late Eocene of New Zealand ( 43 to 33.9 million years ago ) . Specimens reported from Europe are considered Dorudontinae incertae sedis . Zygorhiza kochii , along with Basilosaurus under the designation prehistoric whales , is the state fossil of Mississippi . The mounted specimen in the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson is commonly referred to as Ziggy .",

  "/wiki/Western_honey_bee": "The western honey bee or European honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) is the most common of the 7-12 species of honey bees worldwide . The genus name Apis is Latin for bee , and mellifera is the Latin for honey-bearing , referring to the species ' production of honey . Like all honey bee species , the western honey bee is eusocial , creating colonies with a single fertile female ( or queen ) , many normally non-reproductive females or workers , and a small proportion of fertile males or drones . Individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees . Colony activities are organized by complex communication between individuals , through both pheromones and the dance language . The western honey bee was one of the first domesticated insects , and it is the primary species maintained by beekeepers to this day for both its honey production and pollination activities . With human assistance , the western honey bee now occupies every continent except Antarctica . Because of its wide cultivation , this species is the single most important pollinator for agriculture globally [ citation needed ] . Western honey bees are threatened by pests and diseases , especially the Varroa mite and colony collapse disorder . As of 2019 , the western honey bee is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List , as numerous studies indicate that the species has undergone significant declines in Europe ; however , it is not clear if they refer to population reduction of wild or managed colonies . Further research is required to enable differentiation between wild and non-wild colonies in order to determine the conservation status of the species in the wild . Western honey bees are an important model organism in scientific studies , particularly in the fields of social evolution , learning , and memory ; they are also used in studies of pesticide toxicity , to assess non-target impacts of commercial pesticides .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_mammals": "A state mammal is the official mammal of a U.S. state as designated by a state 's legislature . The first column of the table is for those denoted as the state mammal , and the second shows the state marine mammals . Animals with more specific designations are also listed . Many states also have separately officially designated state birds , state fish , state butterflies , state reptiles , and other animals . Listed separately are state dogs and state horses .",
  "/wiki/White-tailed_deer": "The white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) , also known as the whitetail or Virginia deer , is a medium-sized deer native to North America , Central America , Ecuador , and South America as far south as Peru and Bolivia . It has also been introduced to New Zealand , Cuba , Jamaica , Hispaniola , the Bahamas , the Lesser Antilles , and some countries in Europe , such as the Czech Republic , Finland , Romania , Serbia , Germany , and France . In the Americas , it is the most widely distributed wild ungulate . In North America , the species is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains as well as in southwestern Arizona and most of Mexico , aside from Lower California . It is mostly replaced by the black-tailed or mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) from that point west except for in mixed deciduous riparian corridors , river valley bottomlands , and lower foothills of the northern Rocky Mountain region from South Dakota west to eastern Washington and eastern Oregon and north to northeastern British Columbia and southern Yukon , including in the Montana Valley and Foothill grasslands . Texas is home to the most white-tailed deer of any U.S. state or Canadian province , with an estimated population of over four million . Notably high populations of white-tailed deer occur in the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas . Michigan , Minnesota , Iowa , Mississippi , Missouri , New Jersey , Illinois , Wisconsin , Maryland , New York , North Dakota , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Indiana also boast high deer densities . The conversion of land adjacent to the Canadian Rockies into agriculture use and partial clear-cutting of coniferous trees ( resulting in widespread deciduous vegetation ) has been favorable to the white-tailed deer and has pushed its distribution to as far north as Yukon . Populations of deer around the Great Lakes have also expanded their range northwards , due to conversion of land to agricultural uses favoring more deciduous vegetation , and local caribou and moose populations . The westernmost population of the species , known as the Columbian white-tailed deer , once was widespread in the mixed forests along the Willamette and Cowlitz River valleys of western Oregon and southwestern Washington , but today its numbers have been considerably reduced , and it is classified as near-threatened . This population is separated from other white-tailed deer populations .",
  "/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin": "The common bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ) , or Atlantic bottlenose dolphin , is the most well-known species from the family Delphinidae . Common bottlenose dolphins are the most familiar dolphins due to the wide exposure they receive in captivity in marine parks and dolphinaria , and in movies and television programs . The common bottlenose dolphin is the largest species of the beaked dolphins . They inhabit temperate and tropical oceans throughout the world , and are absent only from polar waters . Until recently , all bottlenose dolphins were considered as a single species , but now the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin and Burrunan dolphin have been split from the common bottlenose dolphin . While formerly named simply as the bottlenose dolphin , this term is now applied to the genus as a whole . The dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide . As considerable genetic variation has been described among members of this species , even between neighboring populations , many experts consider that additional species may be recognized .",

  "/wiki/U.S._state_reptiles": "Twenty-seven U.S. states have named an official state reptile . As with other state symbols , states compare admirable aspects of the reptile and of the state , within designating statutes . Schoolchildren often start campaigns promoting their favorite reptile to encourage state legislators to enact it as a state symbol . Many secretaries of state maintain educational web pages that describe the state reptile . Oklahoma was the first state to name an official reptile , the common collared lizard , in 1969 . Only two states followed in the 1970s , but the ensuing decades saw nominations at a rate of almost one per year . State birds are more common , with all fifty states naming one , and they were adopted earlier , with the first one selected in 1927 . Before their formal designation as state reptiles , Florida 's alligator , Maryland 's terrapin , and Texas 's horned lizard were all mascots of a major in-state university . West Virginia 's timber rattlesnake was an early American flag element dating back to 1775 . Because of their cold-blooded nature , reptiles are more common in warmer climates , and nineteen of the twenty-seven state reptiles represent southern states . Six states chose a species named after the state . A turtle was chosen by more than half of the states .",
  "/wiki/American_alligator": "The American alligator ( Alligator mississippiensis ) , sometimes referred to colloquially as a gator or common alligator , is a large crocodilian reptile endemic to the Southeastern United States . It is one of two living species in the genus Alligator within the family Alligatoridae ; it is larger than the other extant alligator species , the Chinese alligator . Adult male American alligators measure 3.4 to 4.6 m ( 11.2 to 15.1 ft ) in length , and can weigh up to 453 kg ( 999 lb ) . Females are smaller , measuring 2.6 to 3 m ( 8.5 to 9.8 ft ) in length . The American alligator inhabits freshwater wetlands , such as marshes and cypress swamps from Texas to southeastern and coastal North Carolina . It is distinguished from the sympatric American crocodile by its broader snout , with overlapping jaws and darker coloration , and is less tolerant of saltwater but more tolerant of cooler climates than the American crocodile , which is found only in tropical climates . American alligators are apex predators and consume fish , amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals . Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates . They play an important role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes , which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms . Throughout the year , in particular during the breeding season , American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates . Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females . Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation , sticks , leaves , and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_shells": "This is a list of official state shells for those states of the United States that have chosen to select one as part of their state insignia . These are seashells , the shells of various marine mollusks including both gastropod and bivalves . Each one was chosen to represent a maritime state , based on the fact that the species occurs in that state and was considered suitable to represent the state , either because of the species ' commercial importance as a local seafood item , or because of its beauty , rarity , exceptional size , or other features .",
  "/wiki/Eastern_oyster": "The eastern oyster ( Crassostrea virginica ) - also called Wellfleet oyster , Atlantic oyster , Virginia oyster , or American oyster - is a species of true oyster native to the eastern seaboard and Gulf of Mexico coast of North America . It is also farmed in Puget Sound , Washington , where it is known as the Totten Inlet Virginica . Eastern oysters are and have been very popular commercially . Today , less than 1% of the population when the first 17th-century colonists arrived is thought to remain in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries ."
