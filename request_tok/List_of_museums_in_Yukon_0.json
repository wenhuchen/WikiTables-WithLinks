  "/wiki/SS_Klondike": "SS Klondike was the name of two sternwheelers , the second now a national historic site located in Whitehorse , Yukon , Canada . They ran freight between Whitehorse and Dawson City along the Yukon River , the first from 1929-1936 and the second , an almost exact replica of the first , from 1937-1950 . Klondike I was built by the British Yukon Navigation Company ( a subsidiary of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company ) in 1929 and had the distinction of having 50% more capacity than a regular sternwheeler , while still having the shallow draft and meeting the size requirements in order to travel down the Yukon River . Klondike I had a cargo capacity of 270 metric tonnes without having to push a barge . Klondike I ran aground in June 1936 north of 'The Thirty Mile ' section of the Yukon River ( at 61\u00b040\u203217\u2033N 134\u00b052\u203222\u2033W / 61.67139\u00b0N 134.87278\u00b0W / 61.67139 ; -134.87278 ( The Thirty Mile ) ) . The company salvaged the ship 's boiler , engines and many fittings to build Klondike II the following year . The hull of the SS Klondike I can still be seen at low water by canoeists on the Yukon River . Klondike II carried freight until the early 1950s . Due to the construction of a highway connecting Dawson City and Whitehorse , many Yukon River sternwheelers were decommissioned . In an attempt to save Klondike II , she was converted into a cruise ship . The venture shut down in 1955 due to lack of interest , and Klondike II was left on the ways in the Whitehorse shipyards . The ship was donated to Parks Canada and was gradually restored until 1966 , when city authorities agreed to move the ship to its present location , at that time part of a squatters ' area .",
