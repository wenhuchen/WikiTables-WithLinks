  "/wiki/Calcite": "Calcite is a carbonate mineral and the most stable polymorph of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) . The Mohs scale of mineral hardness , based on scratch hardness comparison , defines value 3 as calcite . Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals aragonite and vaterite . Aragonite will change to calcite over timescales of days or less at temperatures exceeding 300 \u00b0C , and vaterite is even less stable .",
  "/wiki/Ice": "Ice /a\u026as/ is water frozen into a solid state . Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air , it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color . In the Solar System , ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects . Beyond the Solar System , it occurs as interstellar ice . It is abundant on Earth 's surface - particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line - and , as a common form of precipitation and deposition , plays a key role in Earth 's water cycle and climate . It falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost , icicles or ice spikes . Ice molecules can exhibit eighteen or more different phases ( packing geometries ) that depend on temperature and pressure . When water is cooled rapidly ( quenching ) , up to three different types of amorphous ice can form depending on the history of its pressure and temperature . When cooled slowly correlated proton tunneling occurs below \u2212253.15 \u00b0C ( 20 K , \u2212423.67 \u00b0F ) giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena . Virtually all the ice on Earth 's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice Ih ( spoken as ice one h ) with minute traces of cubic ice denoted as ice Ic . The most common phase transition to ice Ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0 \u00b0C ( 273.15 K , 32 \u00b0F ) at standard atmospheric pressure . It may also be deposited directly by water vapor , as happens in the formation of frost .",

  "/wiki/Tetragonal": "In crystallography , the tetragonal crystal system is one of the 7 crystal systems . Tetragonal crystal lattices result from stretching a cubic lattice along one of its lattice vectors , so that the cube becomes a rectangular prism with a square base ( a by a ) and height ( c , which is different from a ) .",
  "/wiki/Quartz": "Quartz is a hard , crystalline mineral composed of silicon and oxygen atoms . The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon-oxygen tetrahedra , with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra , giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2 . Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth 's continental crust , behind feldspar . Quartz exists in two forms , the normal \u03b1-quartz and the high-temperature \u03b2-quartz , both of which are chiral . The transformation from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz takes place abruptly at 573 \u00b0C ( 846 K ; 1,063 \u00b0F ) . Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume , it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature threshold . There are many different varieties of quartz , several of which are semi-precious gemstones . Since antiquity , varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and hardstone carvings , especially in Eurasia .",
  "/wiki/Ruby": "A ruby is a pink to blood-red colored gemstone , a variety of the mineral corundum ( aluminium oxide ) . Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called sapphires . Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems , together with amethyst , sapphire , emerald , and diamond . The word ruby comes from ruber , Latin for red . The color of a ruby is due to the element chromium . Some gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies , such as the Black Prince 's Ruby in the British Imperial State Crown , are actually spinels . These were once known as Balas rubies . The quality of a ruby is determined by its color , cut , and clarity , which , along with carat weight , affect its value . The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood , commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality . After color follows clarity : similar to diamonds , a clear stone will command a premium , but a ruby without any needle-like rutile inclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated . Ruby is the traditional birthstone for July and is usually pinker than garnet , although some rhodolite garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies . The world 's most valuable ruby is the Sunrise Ruby .",
  "/wiki/Rutile": "Rutile is a mineral composed primarily of titanium dioxide ( TiO2 ) , and is the most common natural form of TiO2 . Other rarer polymorphs of TiO2 are known including anatase , akaogiite , and brookite . Rutile has one of the highest refractive indices at visible wavelengths of any known crystal and also exhibits a particularly large birefringence and high dispersion . Owing to these properties , it is useful for the manufacture of certain optical elements , especially polarization optics , for longer visible and infrared wavelengths up to about 4.5 \u03bcm . Natural rutile may contain up to 10% iron and significant amounts of niobium and tantalum . Rutile derives its name from the Latin rutilus , red , in reference to the deep red color observed in some specimens when viewed by transmitted light . Rutile was first described in 1803 by Abraham Gottlob Werner .",
  "/wiki/Sapphire": "Sapphire is a precious gemstone , a variety of the mineral corundum , consisting of aluminum oxide ( \u03b1-Al2O3 ) with trace amounts of elements such as iron , titanium , chromium , vanadium , or magnesium . It is typically blue , but natural fancy sapphires also occur in yellow , purple , orange , and green colors ; parti sapphires show two or more colors . The only color corundum stone that the term sapphire is not used for is red , which is called a ruby . Pink colored corundum may be either classified as ruby or sapphire depending on locale . Commonly , natural sapphires are cut and polished into gemstones and worn in jewelry . They also may be created synthetically in laboratories for industrial or decorative purposes in large crystal boules . Because of the remarkable hardness of sapphires - 9 on the Mohs scale ( the third hardest mineral , after diamond at 10 and moissanite at 9.5 ) - sapphires are also used in some non-ornamental applications , such as infrared optical components , high-durability windows , wristwatch crystals and movement bearings , and very thin electronic wafers , which are used as the insulating substrates of special-purpose solid-state electronics such as integrated circuits and GaN-based blue LEDs . Sapphire is the birthstone for September and the gem of the 45th anniversary . A sapphire jubilee occurs after 65 years .",
  "/wiki/Silicon_carbide": "Silicon carbide ( SiC ) , also known as carborundum /k\u0251\u02d0rb\u0259\u02c8r\u028cnd\u0259m/ , is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon . It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite . Synthetic SiC powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive . Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance , such as car brakes , car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests . Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907 . SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages , or both . Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method and they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite .",

  "/wiki/Zircon": "Zircon ( /\u02c8z\u025c\u02d0rk\u0252n/ or /\u02c8z\u025c\u02d0rk\u0259n/ ) is a mineral belonging to the group of nesosilicates . Its chemical name is zirconium silicate , and its corresponding chemical formula is ZrSiO4 . A common empirical formula showing some of the range of substitution in zircon is ( Zr1-y , REEy ) ( SiO4 ) 1-x ( OH ) 4x-y . Zircon forms in silicate melts with large proportions of high field strength incompatible elements . For example , hafnium is almost always present in quantities ranging from 1 to 4% . The crystal structure of zircon is tetragonal crystal system . The natural colour of zircon varies between colourless , yellow-golden , red , brown , blue and green . Colourless specimens that show gem quality are a popular substitute for diamond and are also known as Matura diamond . The name derives from the Persian zargun , meaning gold-hued . This word is corrupted into jargoon , a term applied to light-colored zircons . The English word zircon is derived from Zirkon , which is the German adaptation of this word . Yellow , orange and red zircon is also known as hyacinth , from the flower hyacinthus , whose name is of Ancient Greek origin ."
