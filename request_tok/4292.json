  "/wiki/Mount_Everest": "Mount Everest ( Nepali : Sagarmatha \u0938\u0917\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0925\u093e ; Tibetan : Chomolungma \u0f47\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f58 ; Chinese : Zhumulangma \u73e0\u7a46\u6717\u739b ) is Earth 's highest mountain above sea level , located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas . The international border between Nepal ( Province No . 1 ) and China ( Tibet Autonomous Region ) runs across its summit point . The current official elevation of 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) , recognised by China and Nepal , was established by a 1955 Indian survey and subsequently confirmed by a Chinese survey in 1975 . In 1865 , Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society , as recommended by Andrew Waugh , the British Surveyor General of India , who chose the name of his predecessor in the post , Sir George Everest , despite Everest 's objections . Mount Everest attracts many climbers , some of them highly experienced mountaineers . There are two main climbing routes , one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal ( known as the standard route ) and the other from the north in Tibet . While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route , Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness , weather , and wind , as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall . As of 2019 [ update ] , over 300 people have died on Everest , many of whose bodies remain on the mountain . The first recorded efforts to reach Everest 's summit were made by British mountaineers . As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time , the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side . After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m ( 22,970 ft ) on the North Col , the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m ( 27,300 ft ) , marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m ( 26,247 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Dick_Fosbury": "Richard Douglas Fosbury ( born March 6 , 1947 ) is an American retired high jumper , who is considered one of the most influential athletes in the history of track and field . Besides winning a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics , he revolutionized the high jump event with a back-first technique , now known as the Fosbury Flop , adopted by almost all high jumpers today . His method was to sprint diagonally towards the bar , then curve and leap backwards over the bar , which gave him a much lower center of mass in flight than traditional techniques . He continues to be involved in athletics and serves on the executive board of the World Olympians Association . In 2014 Fosbury unsuccessfully challenged Steve Miller for a seat in the Idaho House of Representatives . Fosbury ran for Blaine County Commissioner against incumbent Larry Schoen in 2018 . He won the seat and took office in January 2019 .",
  "/wiki/Fosbury_Flop": "The Fosbury Flop is a style used in the athletics event of high jump . It was popularized and perfected by American athlete Dick Fosbury , whose gold medal in the 1968 Summer Olympics ( Mexico ) brought it to the world 's attention . Over the next few years , the flop became the dominant style of the event and remains so today . Before Fosbury , most elite jumpers used the straddle technique , Western Roll , Eastern cut-off or scissors jump to clear the bar . Given that landing surfaces had previously been sandpits or low piles of matting , high jumpers of earlier years had to land on their feet or at least land carefully to prevent injury . With the advent of deep foam matting high jumpers were able to be more adventurous in their landing styles and hence experiment with styles of jumping .",
  "/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics": "The 1968 Summer Olympics ( Spanish : Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos de Verano de 1968 ) , officially known as the Games of the XIX Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event held in Mexico City , Mexico , from October 12 to the 27th . These were the first Olympic Games to be staged in Latin America and the first to be staged in a Spanish-speaking country . They were the first Games to use an all-weather ( smooth ) track for track and field events instead of the traditional cinder track . The 1968 Games were the third to be held in the last quarter of the year , after the 1956 Games in Melbourne and the 1964 Games in Tokyo . The Mexican Student Movement of 1968 happened concurrently and the Olympic Games were correlated to the government 's repression . The United States won the most gold and overall medals for the last time until 1984 .",

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete , some 600 more than expected , accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries . There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports . Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance . 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began . Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system . There have been arguments ( mostly in popular media ) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis , however , there is little or no evidence for such a correlation . The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success , with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world .",

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world .

European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .
