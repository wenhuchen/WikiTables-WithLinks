The film was released in two parts : Olympia 1 . Teil - Fest der V\u00f6lker ( Festival of Nations ) and Olympia 2 . Teil - Fest der Sch\u00f6nheit ( Festival of Beauty ) . It was the first documentary feature film of an Olympic Games ever made . Many advanced motion picture techniques , which later became industry standards but which were groundbreaking at the time , were employed , including unusual camera angles , smash cuts , extreme close-ups and placing tracking shot rails within the bleachers . The techniques employed are almost universally admired , but the film is controversial due to its political context . Nevertheless , it appears on many lists of the greatest films of all time , including Time magazine 's All-Time 100 Movies . Olympia set the precedent for future films documenting and glorifying the Olympic Games , particularly the Summer Games . The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was devised for the Games by the secretary general of the Organizing Committee , Dr. Carl Diem . Riefenstahl staged the torch relay for the film , with competitive events of the Games .

A talented swimmer and artist , she also became interested in dancing during her childhood , taking dancing lessons and performing across Europe . After seeing a promotional poster for the 1924 film Der Berg des Schicksals ( The Mountain of Destiny ) , Riefenstahl was inspired to move into acting . Between 1925 and 1929 , she starred in five successful motion pictures . Riefenstahl became one of the few women in Germany to direct a film during the Weimar Period when , in 1932 , she decided to try directing with her own film called Das Blaue Licht ( The Blue Light ) . In the 1930s , she directed the Nazi propaganda films Triumph des Willens ( Triumph of the Will ) and Olympia , resulting in worldwide attention and acclaim . The movies are widely considered two of the most effective , and technically innovative , propaganda films ever made . Her involvement in Triumph des Willens , however , significantly damaged her career and reputation after the war . Hitler was in close collaboration with Riefenstahl during the production of at least three important Nazi films , and they formed a friendly relationship . Some have argued that Riefenstahl 's visions were essential to the carrying out of the mission of the Holocaust .
