  "/wiki/Tom_Dooley_(song)": "Tom Dooley is a North Carolina folk song based on the 1866 murder of a woman named Laura Foster in Wilkes County , North Carolina , allegedly by Tom Dula . The song is best known today because of a hit version recorded in 1958 by The Kingston Trio . This version was a multi-format hit , which reached # 1 in Billboard and the Billboard R & B listing , and appeared in the Cashbox Country Music Top 20 . The song was selected as one of the American Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , the National Endowment for the Arts , and Scholastic Inc. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time . Tom Dooley fits within the wider genre of Appalachian sweetheart murder ballads . A local poet named Thomas Land wrote a song about the tragedy , titled Tom Dooley ( which was how Dula 's name was pronounced ) , shortly after Dula was hanged . In the documentary Appalachian Journey ( 1991 ) , folklorist Alan Lomax describes Frank Proffitt as the original source for the song , which was misleading only in that he did n't write it . There are several earlier known recordings , notably one that Grayson and Whitter made in 1929 , approximately 10 years before Proffitt cut his own recording . The Kingston Trio took their version from Frank Warner 's singing . Warner had learned the song from Proffitt , who learned it from his Aunt Nancy Prather , whose parents had known both Laura Foster and Tom Dula . In a 1967 interview , Nick Reynolds of the Kingston Trio recounts first hearing the song from another performer , and then being criticized and sued for taking credit for the song . Supported by the testimony of Anne and Frank Warner , Frank Proffitt was eventually acknowledged by the courts as the preserver of the original version of the song , and the Kingston Trio were ordered to pay royalties to him for their uncredited use of it .",

The Trio released nineteen albums that made Billboard 's Top 100 , fourteen of which ranked in the top 10 , and five of which hit the number 1 spot . Four of the group 's LPs charted among the 10 top-selling albums for five weeks in November and December 1959 , a record unmatched for more than 50 years , and the group still ranks in the all-time lists of many of Billboard 's cumulative charts , including those for most weeks with a number 1 album , most total weeks charting an album , most number 1 albums , most consecutive number 1 albums , and most top ten albums . In 1961 , the Trio was described as the most envied , the most imitated , and the most successful singing group , folk or otherwise , in all show business and the undisputed kings of the folksinging rage by every yardstick . The Trio 's massive record sales in its early days made acoustic folk music commercially viable , paving the way for singer-songwriter , folk rock , and Americana artists who followed in their wake .
