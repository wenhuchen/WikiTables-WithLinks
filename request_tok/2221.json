  "/wiki/U.S._Route_6": "U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) , also called the Grand Army of the Republic Highway , honoring the American Civil War veterans association , is a main route of the U.S. Highway system . While it currently runs east-northeast from Bishop , California to Provincetown , Massachusetts , the route has been modified several times . The highway 's longest-lasting routing , from 1936 to 1964 , had its western terminus at Long Beach , California . During this time , US 6 was the longest highway in the country . In 1964 , the state of California renumbered its highways , and most of the route within California was transferred to other highways . This dropped the highway 's length below that of US 20 . US 6 is a diagonal route , whose number is out of sequence with the rest of the U.S. Highway grid in the western US . When it was designated in 1926 , US 6 only ran east of Erie , Pennsylvania . Subsequent extensions , largely replacing the former U.S. Route 32 ( US 32 ) and US 38 , have taken it south of US 30 at Joliet , Illinois , US 40 near Denver , Colorado ( past the end of US 38 ) , US 50 at Ely , Nevada , and even US 70 near Los Angeles , California , due to its north-south alignment in that state . US 6 does not serve a major transcontinental corridor , unlike other highways . George R. Stewart , author of U.S. 40 : Cross Section of the United States of America , initially considered US 6 , but realized that Route 6 runs uncertainly from nowhere to nowhere , scarcely to be followed from one end to the other , except by some devoted eccentric . In the famous beat novel On the Road by Jack Kerouac , protagonist Sal Paradise actually considers hitchhiking on US 6 to Nevada , but is told by a driver that there 's no traffic passes through 6 and that he 'd be better off going via Pittsburgh ( the Pennsylvania Turnpike ) .",

  "/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright": "Frank Lloyd Wright ( June 8 , 1867 - April 9 , 1959 ) was an American architect , interior designer , writer , and educator , whose creative period spanned more than 70 years , designing more than 1,000 structures , of which 532 were completed . Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment , a philosophy he called organic architecture . This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater ( 1935 ) , which has been called the best all-time work of American architecture . As a founder of organic architecture , Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century , influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works . Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture , and he also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City , his unique vision for urban planning in the United States . In addition to his houses , Wright designed original and innovative offices , churches , schools , skyscrapers , hotels , museums , and other structures . He often designed interior elements for these buildings , as well , including furniture and stained glass . Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe . Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as the greatest American architect of all time . In 2019 , a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright . Raised in rural Wisconsin , Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago with noted architects Joseph Lyman Silsbee and Louis Sullivan . He opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 , and developed an influential home and studio in Oak Park , Illinois .",
