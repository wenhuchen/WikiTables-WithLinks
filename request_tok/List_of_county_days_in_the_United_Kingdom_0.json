Buckinghamshire is one of the home counties and towns such as High Wycombe , Amersham , Chesham and the Chalfonts in the east and southeast of the county are parts of the London commuter belt , forming some of the most densely populated parts of the county . Development in this region is restricted by the Metropolitan Green Belt . Other large settlements include the county town of Aylesbury , Marlow in the south near the Thames and Princes Risborough in the west near Oxford . Some areas without direct rail links to London , such as around the old county town of Buckingham and near Olney in the northeast , are much less populous . The largest town is Milton Keynes in the northeast , which with the surrounding area is administered as a unitary authority separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire . The remainder of the county is administered by Buckinghamshire County Council as a non-metropolitan county , and four district councils . In national elections , Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the Conservative Party . A large part of the Chiltern Hills , an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty , runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London . In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick . Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs : several reports have identified the market town of Beaconsfield as having among the highest property prices outside London . Chequers , a mansion estate owned by the government , is the country retreat of the incumbent Prime Minister .",

During the British Iron Age , Roman Britain , and the early Middle Ages , this was the homeland of the Dumnonii Brittonic Celts . ( The shift from M to V is a typical Celtic consonant shift . ) The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of Wessex during the eighth and ninth centuries .

Covering an area of 2,653 square kilometres ( 1,024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north-west , Wiltshire to the north-east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south .

Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points . The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics , and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing , Cornish pilot gig rowing , sea kayaking and powerboating .",

Augustine was the prior of a monastery in Rome when Pope Gregory the Great chose him in 595 to lead a mission , usually known as the Gregorian mission , to Britain to Christianize King \u00c6thelberht and his Kingdom of Kent from Anglo-Saxon paganism . Kent was probably chosen because \u00c6thelberht had married a Christian princess , Bertha , daughter of Charibert I the King of Paris , who was expected to exert some influence over her husband . Before reaching Kent , the missionaries had considered turning back , but Gregory urged them on , and in 597 , Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to \u00c6thelberht 's main town of Canterbury . King \u00c6thelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely , giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls . Augustine was consecrated as a bishop and converted many of the king 's subjects , including thousands during a mass baptism on Christmas Day in 597 . Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601 , along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches , although attempts to persuade the native British bishops to submit to Augustine 's authority failed . Roman bishops were established at London , and Rochester in 604 , and a school was founded to train Anglo-Saxon priests and missionaries . Augustine also arranged the consecration of his successor , Laurence of Canterbury . The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a saint .",

It was established in the Anglo-Saxon period from the territory of the Middle Saxons , and existed as an official administrative unit until 1965 . The county is bounded to the south by the River Thames , and has the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills forming its other boundaries . The largely low-lying county , dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south , was the second smallest by area in 1831 . The City of London was a county corporate from the 12th century and was able to exert political control over Middlesex . Westminster Abbey dominated most of the early financial , judicial and ecclesiastical aspects of the county . As London expanded into rural Middlesex , the Corporation of London resisted attempts to expand the city boundaries into the county , which posed problems for the administration of local government and justice . In the 18th and 19th centuries the population density was especially high in the southeast of the county , including the East End and West End of London . From 1855 the southeast was administered , with sections of Kent and Surrey , as part of the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works .
