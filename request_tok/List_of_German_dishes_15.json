  "/wiki/Buttermilk": "Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink . Traditionally , it was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream ; most modern buttermilk is cultured , however . It is common in warm climates ( including the Balkans , South Asia , the Middle East and the Southern United States ) where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly . Buttermilk can be drunk straight , and it can also be used in cooking . In making soda bread , the acid in buttermilk reacts with the raising agent , sodium bicarbonate , to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent . Buttermilk is also used in marination , especially of chicken and pork , which the lactic acid helps to tenderize , retain moisture and allows added flavors to permeate the meat .",
