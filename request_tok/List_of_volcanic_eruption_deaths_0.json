It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc . Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure . The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii , Herculaneum , Oplontis and Stabiae , as well as several other settlements . The eruption ejected a cloud of stones , ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33 km ( 21 mi ) , erupting molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6\u00d7105 cubic metres ( 7.8\u00d7105 cu yd ) per second , ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy released by the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings . More than 1,000 people died in the eruption , but exact numbers are unknown . The only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus . Vesuvius has erupted many times since and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted within the last hundred years . Today , it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population of 3,000,000 people living near enough to be affected , with 600,000 in the danger zone , making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world , as well as its tendency towards violent , explosive eruptions of the Plinian type .",

Mount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of 33 km ( 21 mi ) , ejecting molten rock , pulverized pumice and hot ash at 1.5 million tons per second , ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings . Several Roman settlements were obliterated and buried underneath massive pyroclastic surges and ashfall deposits , the best known being Pompeii and Herculaneum . After archeological excavations revealed much about the lives of the inhabitants , the area became a major tourist attraction , and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and part of Vesuvius National Park . The total population of both cities was 16,000-20,000 . The remains of over 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum , however the death toll is still unclear . The event is the namesake for the Vesuvian type of volcanic eruptions , characterized by eruption columns of hot gases and ash exploding into the stratosphere , although the event also included pyroclastic flows associated with Pelean eruptions .",

He had a great reputation as a poet ; Quintilian ( Instit . x. I . 96 ) goes so far as to say that with the exception of Horace , he was the only lyric poet worth reading . He is also identified with the author of a treatise De Metris of which considerable fragments , probably of an abbreviated edition , are extant ( ed . Keil , 1885 ) . The work was probably originally in verse , and afterwards recast or epitomized in prose form to be used as an instruction book .

There are several recorded eruptions of this basaltic-andesitic stratovolcano prior to a spectacular lateral collapse which took place in 1888 . Before that event , it was a circular conical island about 780 metres high . At about 5:30 am local time on 13 March 1888 a large portion of the island , containing perhaps 5 km3 of material slid into the sea during a relatively minor , possibly VEI 2 , phreatic eruption . Eyewitnesses at Finschhafen , 100 km to the South , heard explosions and observed an almost imperceptible ash fall . Tsunamis 12-15 metres high were generated by the collapse and devastated nearby islands and the adjacent New Guinea coast killing around 3000 people . The collapse left a 140 metre high 1900 metre long crescent-shaped island with a steep west-facing escarpment . At least two small eruptions have occurred offshore since 1888 , one in 1972 and another in 1974 , which have resulted in the construction of a small submarine edifice within the collapse scar .",

Historically , K\u012blauea is the most active of the five volcanoes that together form the island of Hawai\u02bbi . Located along the southeastern shore of the island , the volcano is between 210,000 and 280,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago . It is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain . Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa , K\u012blauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor . Structurally , K\u012blauea has a large , fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones , one extending 125 km ( 78 mi ) east and the other 35 km ( 22 mi ) west , as an active fault of unknown depth moving vertically an average of 2 to 20 mm ( 0.1 to 0.8 in ) per year . K\u012blauea erupted nearly continuously from 1983 to 2018 , causing considerable property damage , including the destruction of the towns of Kalapana and Kaim\u016b along with the renowned black sand beach , in 1990 . During the 2018 lower Puna eruption , two dozen lava vents erupted downrift from the summit in Puna . The eruption was accompanied by a strong earthquake on May 4 of Mw 6.9 , and nearly 2,000 residents were evacuated from the rural Leilani Estates subdivision and nearby areas . On May 17 , 2018 the volcano explosively erupted at the summit in Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu , throwing ash 30,000 feet into the air . Continued explosive activity at the summit caused a months-long closure of the K\u012blauea section of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park .

It is 50 miles ( 80 km ) northeast of Portland , Oregon and 96 miles ( 154 km ) south of Seattle , Washington . Mount St. Helens takes its English name from the British diplomat Lord St Helens , a friend of explorer George Vancouver who made a survey of the area in the late 18th century . The volcano is located in the Cascade Range and is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , a segment of the Pacific Ring of Fire that includes over 160 active volcanoes . This volcano is well known for its ash explosions and pyroclastic flows . Mount St. Helens is most notorious for its major eruption on May 18 , 1980 , the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history . Fifty-seven people were killed ; 250 homes , 47 bridges , 15 miles ( 24 km ) of railways , and 185 miles ( 298 km ) of highway were destroyed . A massive debris avalanche , triggered by an earthquake of magnitude 5.1 , caused a lateral eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain 's summit from 9,677 ft ( 2,950 m ) to 8,363 ft ( 2,549 m ) , leaving a 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) wide horseshoe-shaped crater . The debris avalanche was up to 0.7 cubic miles ( 2.9 km3 ) in volume . The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was created to preserve the volcano and allow for the eruption 's aftermath to be scientifically studied . As with most other volcanoes in the Cascade Range , Mount St. Helens is a large eruptive cone consisting of lava rock interlayered with ash , pumice , and other deposits . The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted .",
  "/wiki/1980_eruption_of_Mount_St._Helens": "The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was a series of volcanic explosions and pyroclastic flows from Mount St. Helens in Skamania County , U.S. state of Washington , that began on March 27 , 1980 . It initiated as a series of phreatic blasts from the summit then escalated on May 18 , 1980 , as a major explosive eruption . The eruption , which had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 5 , was the most significant to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the much smaller 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California . It has often been declared the most disastrous volcanic eruption in U.S. history . The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes , caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain 's north slope . An earthquake at 8:32:17 a.m. PDT ( UTC\u22127 ) on Sunday , May 18 , 1980 , caused the entire weakened north face to slide away , creating the largest landslide ever recorded . This allowed the partly molten , high-pressure gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock , overtaking the avalanching face . An eruption column rose 80,000 feet ( 24 km ; 15 mi ) into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states and significant ash in two Canadian provinces . At the same time , snow , ice and several entire glaciers on the volcano melted , forming a series of large lahars ( volcanic mudslides ) that reached as far as the Columbia River , nearly 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the southwest . Less severe outbursts continued into the next day , only to be followed by other large , but not as destructive , eruptions later that year . Thermal energy released during the eruption was equal to 26 megatons of TNT . Approximately 57 people were killed directly , including innkeeper Harry R. Truman , photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg , and geologist David A. Johnston .",

It is a stratovolcano composed of many layers of lava alternating with hardened volcanic ash and other pyroclastic rocks . Volcanic activity at Nevado del Ruiz began about two million years ago , since the Early Pleistocene or Late Pliocene , with three major eruptive periods . The current volcanic cone formed during the present eruptive period , which began 150 thousand years ago . The volcano usually generates Vulcanian to Plinian eruptions , which produce swift-moving currents of hot gas and rock called pyroclastic flows . These eruptions often cause massive lahars ( mud and debris flows ) , which pose a threat to human life and the environment . The impact of such an eruption is increased as the hot gas and lava melt the mountain 's snowcap , adding large quantities of water to the flow . On November 13 , 1985 , a small eruption produced an enormous lahar that buried and destroyed the town of Armero in Tolima , causing an estimated 25,000 deaths . This event later became known as the Armero tragedy - the deadliest lahar in recorded history . Similar but less deadly incidents occurred in 1595 and 1845 , consisting of a small explosive eruption followed by a large lahar . The volcano is part of Los Nevados National Natural Park , which also contains several other volcanoes . The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by large glaciers .",

Colombia is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea , the northwest by Panama , the south by both Ecuador and Peru , the east by Venezuela , the southeast by Brazil , and the west by the Pacific . It comprises thirty-two departments , with the capital in Bogot\u00e1 . Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona . Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders .

After 69 years of dormancy , the volcano 's eruption caught nearby towns unaware , even though the government had received warnings from multiple volcanological organizations to evacuate the area after the detection of volcanic activity two months earlier . As pyroclastic flows erupted from the volcano 's crater , they melted the mountain 's glaciers , sending four enormous lahars ( volcanically induced mudflows , landslides , and debris flows ) down its slopes at 50 kilometers per hour ( 30 miles per hour ) . The lahars picked up speed in gullies and engulfed the town of Armero , killing more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000 inhabitants . Casualties in other towns , particularly Chinchin\u00e1 , brought the overall death toll to 23,000 . Footage and photographs of Omayra S\u00e1nchez , a young victim of the tragedy , were published around the world .

  "/wiki/Harry_Glicken": "Harry Glicken ( March 7 , 1958 - June 3 , 1991 ) was an American volcanologist . He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption , and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston , who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview . In 1991 , while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan , Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow . His remains were found four days later , and were cremated in accordance with his parents ' request . Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions . Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey , Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric . Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations , Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches . He also wrote several major publications on the topic , including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18 , 1980 , Mount St. Helens Volcano , Washington that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon . Since being published posthumously by Glicken 's colleagues in 1996 , the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches . Following his death , Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field .",

His birthplace was in the mountainside hamlet ( Javanese language-dukuh ) of Kinahrejo , Umbulharjo Village , Cangkringan District , of the Sleman Regency , on the island of Java in Indonesia . He was killed at the age of 83 by a pyroclastic flow that destroyed his home in the village of Kinahrejo during the 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Merapi": "Mount Merapi , Gunung Merapi ( literally Fire Mountain in Indonesian and Javanese ) , is an active stratovolcano located on the border between Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces , Indonesia . It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548 . It is located approximately 28 kilometres ( 17 mi ) north of Yogyakarta city which has a population of 2.4 million , and thousands of people live on the flanks of the volcano , with villages as high as 1,700 metres ( 5,600 ft ) above sea level . Smoke can often be seen emerging from the mountaintop , and several eruptions have caused fatalities . Pyroclastic flow from a large explosion killed 27 people on 22 November 1994 , mostly in the town of Muntilan , west of the volcano . Another large eruption occurred in 2006 , shortly before the Yogyakarta earthquake . In light of the hazards that Merapi poses to populated areas , it has been designated as one of the Decade Volcanoes . On 20 October 2010 , the Indonesian government raised the alert for Mount Merapi to its highest level and warned villagers in threatened areas to move to safer ground . People living within the range of a 20 km ( 12 mi ) zone were told to evacuate . Officials said [ who ? ] about 500 volcanic earthquakes had been recorded on the mountain over the weekend of 23-24 October [ vague ] , and that the magma had risen to about 1 kilometre ( 3,300 ft ) below the surface due to the seismic activity . On the afternoon of 25 October 2010 , Mount Merapi erupted lava from its southern and southeastern slopes .",
  "/wiki/2010_eruptions_of_Mount_Merapi": "In late October 2010 , Mount Merapi in Central Java , Indonesia , began an increasingly violent series of eruptions that continued into November . Seismic activity around the volcano increased from mid-September onwards , culminating in repeated outbursts of lava and ashes . Large eruption columns formed , causing numerous pyroclastic flows down the heavily populated slopes of the volcano . Merapi 's eruption was said by authorities to be the largest since the 1870s . Over 350,000 people were evacuated from the affected area . However , many remained behind or returned to their homes while the eruptions were continuing . 353 people were killed during the eruptions , many as a result of pyroclastic flows . The ash plumes from the volcano also caused major disruption to aviation across Java . The mountain continued to erupt until 30 November 2010 . On 3 December 2010 the official alert status was reduced to level 3 , from level 4 , as the eruptive activity had subsided ."
