From 1996-1998 , WCW surpassed their rival program in the ratings for 83 consecutive weeks , threatening to severely undercut their rival and disrupting the American wrestling hierarchy . However , WCW then endured significant losses in ratings and revenue due to creative missteps in the late 1990s , and suffered from the fallout from the merger of Turner Broadcasting parent Time Warner and AOL . Soon thereafter , WCW went out of business , and the WWF purchased selected WCW assets in 2001 , including its video library , some wrestler contracts , and selected intellectual property , including the WCW name and championships . The corporate subsidiary , which was retained to deal with legal obligations and reverted to the Universal Wrestling Corporation name , officially became defunct in 2017 . Its headquarters were located in Atlanta , Georgia .",
  "/wiki/World_Class_Championship_Wrestling": "World Class Championship Wrestling ( WCCW ) , also known as the World Class Wrestling Association ( WCWA ) , was an American professional wrestling promotion headquartered in Dallas and Fort Worth , Texas . Originally owned by promoter Ed McLemore , by 1966 it was run by Southwest Sports , Inc. , whose president , Jack Adkisson , was better known as wrestler Fritz Von Erich . Beginning as a territory of the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) , it went independent in 1986 in a bid to become a major national promotion , but was unsuccessful in its attempts and eventually went out of business in 1990 . Rights to the pre-1989 WCCW tape library belong to WWE ( the post-1988 rights are owned by International World Class Championship Wrestling ) and select episodes from 1982 to 1988 are available on the WWE Network . World Class Championship Wrestling experienced tremendous success from 1981-1985 , shattering attendance records and achieving global exposure through their syndicated television program . Bookers Ken Mantell , David Von Erich , Gary Hart , Bruiser Brody and Kevin Von Erich provided fans with hard hitting action centered on the popular Von Erich brothers and a cast of devious villains . Storylines during this time followed a consistent theme of friendship and betrayal , with many of the top villains being first presented as friends to the Von Erich Family , only to betray them months or even years later . Talent deals and exchanges helped WCCW bring in future stars such as Chris Adams , The Fabulous Freebirds , Jake Roberts , Mick Foley , a young Shawn Michaels , Gino Hernandez and Iceman King Parsons , and others . World Class Championship Wrestling was a member of the NWA and was originally known as Big Time Wrestling until 1982 , when Adkisson decided that the name of his federation needed to be changed . Mickey Grant , who headed the production of its telecasts , suggested the name World Class . WCCW operated its enterprise in Dallas , Texas and held wrestling events at the Reunion Arena , and mostly at the famed Sportatorium , located just south of Downtown Dallas , which was also a well-known boxing and wrestling arena as well as the one-time home to the famous Big D Jamboree .",
  "/wiki/National_Wrestling_Alliance": "The National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) is an American professional wrestling promotion and former governing body operating via its parent company Lightning One , Inc . Founded in 1948 , the NWA began as a governing body for a group of independent professional wrestling promotions , the heads of which made up the Board of Directors . The group operated a territory system which sanctioned various championships , recognized one world champion , participated in talent exchanges , and collectively protected the territorial integrity of member promotions . Prior to the 1960s it acted as the sole governing body for most of professional wrestling . It remained the largest and most influential body in wrestling until the mid-1980s by which time most of the original member promotions went out of business as a result of the World Wrestling Federation 's national expansion . In September 1993 , the largest remaining member promotion , World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) , left the NWA for the second and final time . The NWA would continue as a loose coalition of independent promotions , with NWA : Total Nonstop Action ( NWA : TNA ) given exclusivity over its World Heavyweight and Tag Team championships from June 2002 to May 2007 . In August 2012 , the NWA discontinued its memberships and started licensing its brand to wrestling promotions . As of 2019 , the NWA is no longer a governing body and has since become a singular wrestling promotion .",

  "/wiki/South_Park": "South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the Comedy Central television network . The series revolves around four boys - Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman , and Kenny McCormick - and their exploits in and around the titular Colorado town . The show became infamous for its profanity and dark , surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience . Parker and Stone developed the show from The Spirit of Christmas , two consecutive animated shorts . The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos , ultimately leading to South Park 's production . The pilot episode was produced using cutout animation , leading to all subsequent episodes being produced with computer animation that emulated the cutout technique . South Park features a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters . Since its debut on August 13 , 1997 , 307 episodes of South Park have been broadcast . It debuted with great success , consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program . Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central 's highest-rated shows and is slated to air new episodes through 2022 . Since 2000 , each episode has typically been written and produced in the week preceding its broadcast , with Parker serving as the primary writer and director . The show 's twenty-third season premiered on September 25 , 2019 ."
