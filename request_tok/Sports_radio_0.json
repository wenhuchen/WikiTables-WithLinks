  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications , a call sign ( also known as a call name or call letters - and historically as a call signal - or abbreviated as a call ) is a unique designation for a transmitter station . In the United States of America , they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters . A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency , informally adopted by individuals or organizations , or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station 's identity . The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system . Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations , there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram . In order to save time , two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose . This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation ; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea . These were not globally unique , so a one-letter company identifier ( for instance , 'M ' and two letters as a Marconi station ) was later added . By 1912 , the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard ; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country , and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country .",

  "/wiki/Winnipeg": "Winnipeg ( /\u02c8w\u026an\u026ap\u025b\u0261/ ( listen ) ) is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada . It is centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers , near the longitudinal centre of North America . The city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg ; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water . The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans . French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738 . A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812 , the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873 . As at 2016 [ update ] , Winnipeg is the seventh-most populated municipality in Canada , with a resident population of about 778,500 . Being far inland , the local climate is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average January lows of around \u221221 \u00b0C ( \u22126 \u00b0F ) and average July highs of 26 \u00b0C ( 79 \u00b0F ) . Known as the Gateway to the West , Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy . This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals , including the Festival du Voyageur , the Winnipeg Folk Festival , the Jazz Winnipeg Festival , the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival , and Folklorama . Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games . It is home to several professional sports franchises , including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers ( Canadian football ) , the Winnipeg Jets ( ice hockey ) , Manitoba Moose ( ice hockey ) , Valour FC ( soccer ) , and the Winnipeg Goldeyes ( baseball ) .",
  "/wiki/Manitoba": "Manitoba ( /\u02ccm\u00e6n\u026a\u02c8to\u028ab\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada . It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and is Canada 's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.369 million people . Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province . Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada ."
