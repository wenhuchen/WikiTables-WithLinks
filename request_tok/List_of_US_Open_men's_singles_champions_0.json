Perry won three consecutive Wimbledon Championships from 1934 to 1936 and was World Amateur number one tennis player during those three years . Prior to Andy Murray in 2013 , Perry was the last British player to win the men 's Wimbledon championship , in 1936 , and the last British player to win a men 's singles Grand Slam title , until Andy Murray won the 2012 US Open . Perry was the first player to win a Career Grand Slam , winning all four singles titles , which he completed at the age of 26 at the 1935 French Open . He remains the only British player ever to achieve this . Perry 's first love was table tennis and he was World Champion in 1929 . He began playing tennis aged 14 and his tennis career at 21 , when in 1930 an LTA committee chose him to join a four-man team to tour the United States . In 1933 , Perry helped lead the Great Britain team to victory over France in the Davis Cup ; the team 's first success since 1912 , followed by wins over the United States in 1934 , 1935 , and a fourth consecutive title with victory over Australia in 1936 . But due to his disillusionment with the class-conscious nature of the Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain , the working-class Perry turned professional at the end of the 1936 season and moved to the United States where he became a naturalised US citizen in 1938 . In 1942 , he was drafted into the US Army Air Force during the Second World War . Despite his unprecedented contribution to British tennis , Perry was not accorded full recognition by tennis authorities until later in life because between 1927 and 1967 , the International Lawn Tennis Federation , ignored amateur champions who later turned professional .",
