  "/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada": "The Supreme Court of Canada ( French : Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ) is the highest court of Canada , the final court of appeals in the Canadian justice system . The court grants permission to between 40 and 75 litigants each year to appeal decisions rendered by provincial , territorial and federal appellate courts . Its decisions are the ultimate application of Canadian law and binding upon all lower courts of Canada , except to the extent that they are overridden or otherwise made ineffective by federal or provincial legislation . The effects of any judicial decision on the Common Law , on the interpretation of statutes , or on any other application of law , can , in effect , be nullified by legislation , unless the particular decision of the Court in question involved application of the Canadian Constitution , in which case , the decision ( in most cases ) is completely binding on the legislative branch . This is especially true of decisions which touch upon the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , as decisions under the Charter can not be altered by the legislative branch unless the decision is overridden pursuant to section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ( the notwithstanding clause ) .",
  "/wiki/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights": "The Canadian Bill of Rights ( French : D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits ) is a federal statute and bill of rights enacted by the Parliament of Canada on August 10 , 1960 . It provides Canadians with certain rights at Canadian federal law in relation to other federal statutes . It was the earliest expression of human rights law at the federal level in Canada , though an implied Bill of Rights had already been recognized in the Canadian Common Law . The Canadian Bill of Rights remains in effect but is widely acknowledged to be limited in its effectiveness because it is a federal statute only , and so not directly applicable to provincial laws . These legal and constitutional limitations were a significant reason that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was established as an unambiguously-constitutional-level Bill of Rights for all Canadians , governing the application of both federal and provincial law in Canada , with the patriation of the Constitution of Canada in 1982 . Since patriation , its usefulness at federal law in Canada is mostly limited to issues pertaining to the enjoyment of property , as set forth in its section 1 ( a ) ] - a slightly-broader life , liberty , and security of the person right than is recognized in section seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .",
  "/wiki/Reference_Re_Anti-Inflation_Act": "Reference Re Anti-Inflation Act , 2 S.C.R . 373 was a landmark reference question opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada on the constitutionality of the Anti-Inflation Act . In what has become among the most significant federalism cases of the Supreme Court , the Act was held to be within the power of the federal government . The Anti-Inflation Act was passed in 1975 , on recommendation of the Bank of Canada , to control the growing inflation of the past several years . Due to growing unease with the Act , the federal government put two questions to the Supreme Court on the validity of the Act . The major question being whether the Act was ultra vires of the federal government . First , the Court noted that the subject-matter of the Act being inflation made it impossible to assign to one of the enumerated powers in the Constitution Act , 1867 . Consequently , the Act would be able to be upheld only under the peace , order and good government ( POGG ) power under the Constitution which allowed the federal government to legislate in matters related to emergencies or matters of national concern . The Court looked at both options and found that the law could be saved under the emergency power of the peace , order and good government power .",
  "/wiki/Patriation_Reference": "Reference Re Resolution to amend the Constitution - also known as the Patriation Reference - is a historic Supreme Court of Canada reference case that occurred during negotiations for the patriation of the Constitution of Canada . The Court affirmed the existence of an unwritten dimension to the Constitution and the majority held that by constitutional convention , amendments to the Constitution require a substantial degree of provincial consent . However , a differently-constituted majority of the court held that there was no legal barrier to the federal government seeking a constitutional amendment without any provincial consent .",
  "/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)": "A constitutional convention is an informal and uncodified procedural agreement that is followed by the institutions of a state . In some states , notably those Commonwealth of Nations states that follow the Westminster system and whose political systems derive from British constitutional law , most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution . In these states , actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe . In particular , the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the head of state that , in practice , are used only on the advice of the head of government , and in some cases not at all . Some constitutional conventions operate separate from or alongside written constitutions , such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the Constitution Act , 1867 . In others , notably the United Kingdom , which lack a single overarching constitutional document , unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions . In most states , however , many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws ( called codification ) .",

The section , while within the Constitution of Canada , falls outside the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The section does not define the term aboriginal rights or provide a closed list ; some examples of the rights that section 35 has been found to protect are fishing , logging , hunting , the right to land ( cf . aboriginal title ) and the right to enforcement of treaties . There remains a debate over whether the right to indigenous self-government is included within section 35 . As of 2006 [ update ] the Supreme Court of Canada has made no ruling on the matter .

The plaintiffs lost the case at trial , but the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a new trial because of deficiencies relating to the pleadings and treatment of evidence . In this decision , the Court went on to describe the nature and scope of the protection given to Aboriginal title under section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , defined how a claimant can prove Aboriginal title , and clarified how the justification test from R v Sparrow applies when Aboriginal title is infringed . : para 16 The decision is also important for its treatment of oral testimony as evidence of historic occupation . :91 While much of the decision is technically obiter dicta ( since a new trial was ordered due to errors in how the evidence and pleadings were treated ) , the principles from Delgamuukw were restated and summarized in Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia , 2014 SCC 44.:100,104 There has not yet been a second trial in this case .",

The decision established one of the first principles of fundamental justice in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ( Charter ) , beyond mere natural justice , by requiring a fault component for all offences with penal consequences . The decision also proved important and controversial for establishing fundamental justice as more than a procedural right similar to due process , but also protects substantive rights even though such rights were counter to the intent of the initial drafters of the Charter .",

There are three types of protection within the section : the right to life , liberty and security of the person . Denials of these rights are constitutional only if the denials do not breach what is referred to as fundamental justice . This Charter provision provides both substantive and procedural rights . It has broad application beyond merely protecting due process in administrative proceedings and in the adjudicative context , and has in certain circumstances touched upon major national policy issues such as entitlement to social assistance and public health care . As such , it has proven to be a controversial provision in the Charter .",
  "/wiki/Absolute_liability": "Absolute liability is a standard of legal liability found in tort and criminal law of various legal jurisdictions . To be convicted of an ordinary crime , in certain jurisdictions , a person must not only have committed a criminal action but also have had a deliberate intention or guilty mind ( mens rea ) . In a crime of strict or absolute liability , a person could be guilty even if there was no intention to commit a crime . The difference between strict and absolute liability is whether the defence of a mistake of fact is available : in a crime of absolute liability , a mistake of fact is not a defence . Strict or absolute liability can also arise from inherently dangerous activities or defective products that are likely to result in a harm to another , regardless of protection taken , such as owning a pet rattle snake ; negligence is not required to be proven .",

  "/wiki/Abortion": "Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus . [ note 1 ] An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion . When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy , it is called an induced abortion , or less frequently induced miscarriage . The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion . A similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a late termination of pregnancy or less accurately as a late term abortion . When properly done , abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine , but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death , especially in the developing world . Making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths . It is safer than childbirth , which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the United States . Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions . The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy . The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device . Birth control , such as the pill or intrauterine devices , can be used immediately following abortion .",
  "/wiki/Criminal_Code_(Canada)": "The Criminal Code ( French : Code criminel ) is a law that codifies most criminal offences and procedures in Canada .

Section 91 ( 27 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 establishes the sole jurisdiction of Parliament over criminal law in Canada . The Criminal Code contains some defences , but most are part of the common law rather than statute . Important Canadian criminal laws not forming part of the code include the Firearms Act , the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , the Canada Evidence Act , the Food and Drugs Act , the Youth Criminal Justice Act and the Contraventions Act . One of the conveniences of the Criminal Code was that it constituted the principle that no person would be able to be convicted of a crime unless otherwise specifically outlined and stated in a statute .

  "/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights": "Negative and positive rights are rights that oblige either action ( positive rights ) or inaction ( negative rights ) . These obligations may be of either a legal or moral character . The notion of positive and negative rights may also be applied to liberty rights . To take an example involving two parties in a court of law : Adrian has a negative right to x against Clay if and only if Clay is prohibited from acting upon Adrian in some way regarding x . In contrast , Adrian has a positive right to x against Clay if and only if Clay is obliged to act upon Adrian in some way regarding x . A case in point , if Adrian has a negative right to life against Clay , then Clay is required to refrain from killing Adrian ; while if Adrian has a positive right to life against Clay , then Clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of Adrian . Rights considered negative rights may include civil and political rights such as freedom of speech , life , private property , freedom from violent crime , freedom of religion , habeas corpus , a fair trial , and freedom from slavery . Rights considered positive rights , as initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist Karel Va\u0161\u00e1k , may include other civil and political rights such as police protection of person and property and the right to counsel , as well as economic , social and cultural rights such as food , housing , public education , employment , national security , military , health care , social security , internet access , and a minimum standard of living . In the three generations account of human rights , negative rights are often associated with the first generation of rights , while positive rights are associated with the second and third generations .

  "/wiki/Purposive_theory": "The purposive approach ( sometimes referred to as purposivism , purposive construction , purposive interpretation , or the modern principle in construction ) is an approach to statutory and constitutional interpretation under which common law courts interpret an enactment ( a statute , part of a statute , or a clause of a constitution ) within the context of the law 's purpose . Purposive interpretation is a derivation of mischief rule set in Heydon 's Case , and intended to replace the mischief rule , the plain meaning rule and the golden rule . Purposive interpretation is used when the courts use extraneous materials from the pre-enactment phase of legislation , including early drafts , hansards , committee reports , and white papers . The purposive interpretation involves a rejection of the exclusionary rule . Israeli jurist Aharon Barak views purposive interpretation as a legal construction that combines elements of the subjective and objective . Barak states that the subjective elements include the intention of the author of the text , whereas the objective elements include the intent of the reasonable author and the legal systems fundamental values . Critics of purposivism argue it fails to separate the powers between the legislator and the judiciary , as it allows more freedom in interpretation by way of extraneous materials in interpreting the law .",

  "/wiki/William_Blackstone": "Sir William Blackstone SL KC ( 10 July 1723 - 14 February 1780 ) was an English jurist , judge and Tory politician of the eighteenth century . He is most noted for writing the Commentaries on the Laws of England . Born into a middle-class family in London , Blackstone was educated at Charterhouse School before matriculating at Pembroke College , Oxford in 1738 . After switching to and completing a Bachelor of Civil Law degree , he was made a Fellow of All Souls , Oxford on 2 November 1743 , admitted to Middle Temple , and called to the Bar there in 1746 . Following a slow start to his career as a barrister , Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration , becoming accountant , treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750 . Blackstone is considered responsible for completing the Codrington Library and Warton Building , and simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college . On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and instead embarked on a series of lectures on English law , the first of their kind . These were massively successful , earning him a total of \u00a3453 ( \u00a371,000 in 2020 terms ) , and led to the publication of An Analysis of the Laws of England in 1756 , which repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works . On 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first Vinerian Professor of English Law , immediately embarking on another series of lectures and publishing a similarly successful second treatise , titled A Discourse on the Study of the Law . With his growing fame , Blackstone successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice , also securing election as Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Hindon on 30 March 1761 . In November 1765 he published the first of four volumes of Commentaries on the Laws of England , considered his magnum opus ; the completed work earned Blackstone \u00a314,000 ( \u00a31,961,000 in 2020 terms ) .
