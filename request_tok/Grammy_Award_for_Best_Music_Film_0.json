  "/wiki/Gwar": "Gwar , often stylized as GWAR , is an American heavy metal band formed in Richmond , Virginia in 1984 , composed of and operated by a frequently rotating line-up of musicians , artists and filmmakers collectively known as Slave Pit Inc . Following the death of frontman and lead singer Dave Brockie in 2014 , the group has continued without any of its founding members . Easily identified by their distinctively grotesque costumes , Gwar 's core thematic and visual concept revolves around an elaborate science fiction-themed mythology which portrays the band members as barbaric interplanetary warriors , a narrative which serves as the basis for all of the band 's albums , videos , live shows and other media . Rife with over-the-top violent , sexual , and scatological humor typically incorporating social and political satire , Gwar has attracted both acclaim and controversy for its music and stage shows , the latter of which notoriously showcase enactments of graphic violence that result in the audience being sprayed with copious amounts of fake blood , urine , and semen . Such stagecraft regularly leads Gwar to be labeled a shock rock band by the media . Since its formation , Gwar has released thirteen studio albums , two live albums , and numerous singles among other recordings , and has sold over 820,000 records in the United States . Fueled largely by the controversies surrounding their concerts , Gwar experienced brief mainstream notoriety during the first half of the 1990s , receiving regular airplay on MTV as well as frequent in-character guest appearances on daytime talk shows , satirizing the topics of censorship and media violence . Though the band 's mainstream popularity declined by the end of the 1990s , Gwar has retained a dedicated cult following . The band 's extensive videography consists of both live recordings and long-form feature films , most notably 1992 's Phallus in Wonderland , which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Long Form Music Video . Outside of music and video , Gwar has expanded its franchise into comic books , trading cards , a board game , signature beers , barbecue sauces , and e-liquids .",

He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music . Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz . Born in Alton , Illinois and raised in East St. Louis , Davis left to study at the Juilliard School in New York City , before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker 's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948 . Shortly after , he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records , which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz . In the early 1950s , Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction . After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955 , he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album 'Round About Midnight . It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers , key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s . During this period , he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans , such as the Spanish-influenced Sketches of Spain ( 1960 ) , and band recordings , such as Milestones ( 1958 ) and Kind of Blue ( 1959 ) . The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time , having sold over four million copies in the U.S. Davis made several line-up changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come ( 1961 ) , his 1961 Blackhawk concerts , and Seven Steps to Heaven ( 1963 ) , another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter , pianist Herbie Hancock , and drummer Tony Williams . After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964 , Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members , helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P ( 1965 ) and Miles Smiles ( 1967 ) , before transitioning into his electric period .

This short film is essentially an extended music video featuring songs from Bush 's 1993 album , The Red Shoes , which in turn was inspired by the classic movie musical-fantasy The Red Shoes .

Once on her feet , the shoes start dancing on their own , and Bush 's character ( who is never referred to by name ) must battle Richardson 's character to free herself from the spell of the shoes . Her guide on this strange journey is played by Kemp . The film was released direct-to-video in most areas and was only a modest success ; Kate Bush later expressed her displeasure with the final product , calling it a load of bollocks . Soon after its release , Bush effectively dropped out of the public eye until her eighth studio album , Aerial , was released in November 2005 . Two years after the UK release , due to late promotion in the US , the film was nominated for the Long Form Music Video at the 1996 Grammy Awards . The film continues to be played in arthouse cinemas around the world , such as a screening at Hollywood Theatre in 2014 where the film was screened along with modern dance interpretations to Bush 's music .",

Located in the inner-city area of Saint-Michel , it was founded in Baie-Saint-Paul on 16 June 1984 by former street performers Guy Lalibert\u00e9 and Gilles Ste-Croix . Originating as a performing troupe called Les \u00c9chassiers ( [ lez\u203fe.\u0283a.sje ] , The Waders ) , they toured Quebec in various forms between 1979 and 1983 . Their initial financial hardship was relieved in 1983 by a government grant from the Canada Council for the Arts to perform as part of the 450th anniversary celebrations of Jacques Cartier 's voyage to Canada . Their first official production Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success in 1984 , and after securing a second year of funding , Lalibert\u00e9 hired Guy Caron from the National Circus School to recreate it as a proper circus . Its theatrical , character-driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus ( nouveau cirque ) that it remains today . After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s , Nouvelle Exp\u00e9rience was created - with the direction of Franco Dragone - which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990 , but allowed it to create new shows . Cirque du Soleil expanded rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s , growing from one show to 19 shows in over 300 cities on every continent except Antarctica . The company employs 4,900 people from 50 countries and generates an annual revenue of approximately US $ 1 billion . The multiple permanent Las Vegas shows alone play to more than 9,000 people a night , 5% of the city 's visitors , adding to the over 100 million people who have seen Cirque du Soleil productions worldwide . In 2000 , Lalibert\u00e9 bought out Daniel Gauthier , and with 95% ownership continued to expand the brand . In 2008 , Lalibert\u00e9 split 20% of his share equally between the investment groups Istithmar World and Nakheel of Dubai in order to further finance the company 's goals .",

After leaving the band in 1970 , Reed released twenty solo studio albums . His second , Transformer ( 1972 ) , was produced by David Bowie and arranged by Mick Ronson , and brought mainstream recognition . The album is considered an influential landmark of the glam rock genre , anchored by Reed 's most successful single , Walk on the Wild Side . After Transformer , the less commercial but critically acclaimed Berlin reached No . 7 on the UK Albums Chart . Rock ' n ' Roll Animal ( a live album released in 1974 ) sold strongly , and Sally Ca n't Dance ( 1974 ) peaked at No . 10 on the Billboard 200 ; but for a long period after , Reed 's work did not translate into sales , leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism . Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s , and gradually returned to prominence with New Sensations ( 1984 ) , reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album New York . Reed participated in the reformation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s , and made several more albums , including a collaboration album with John Cale titled Songs for Drella which was a tribute to their former mentor Andy Warhol .",
