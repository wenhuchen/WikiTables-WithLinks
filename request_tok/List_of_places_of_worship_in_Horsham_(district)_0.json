  "/wiki/Anglicanism": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",
  "/wiki/Parish_church": "A parish church ( or parochial church ) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish . In many parts of the world , especially in rural areas , the parish church may play a significant role in community activities , often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events . The church building reflects this status , and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches . Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages , but all periods of architecture are represented .",

  "/wiki/Norman_architecture": "The term Norman architecture is used to categorise styles of Romanesque architecture developed by the Normans in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries . In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture . The Normans introduced large numbers of castles and fortifications including Norman keeps , and at the same time monasteries , abbeys , churches and cathedrals , in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded arches ( particularly over windows and doorways ) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style .",

  "/wiki/Ralph_Neville": "Ralph Neville ( or Ralf Nevill ; died 1244 ) was a medieval clergyman and politician who served as Bishop of Chichester and Lord Chancellor of England . Neville first appears in the historical record in 1207 in the service of King John , and remained in royal service throughout the rest of his life . By 1213 Neville had custody of the Great Seal of England , although he was not named chancellor , the office responsible for the seal , until 1226 . He was rewarded with the bishopric of Chichester in 1222 . Although he was also briefly Archbishop-elect of Canterbury and Bishop-elect of Winchester , both elections were set aside , or quashed , and he held neither office . As keeper of the seal , and subsequently as chancellor , Neville was noted for his impartiality , and he oversaw a number of changes in the way the chancery operated . Neville was deprived of the Great Seal in 1238 after quarrelling with King Henry III , but continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death . He died in his London palace , built on a street later renamed Chancery Lane owing to his connection with the chancery .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_era": "In the history of the United Kingdom , the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign , from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901 . The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine . Between 1837 and 1901 about 15 million emigrated from Great Britain , mostly to the United States , Canada , South Africa , New Zealand , and Australia .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope . Its central administration is the Holy See . The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed . The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , [ note 1 ] that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles , and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ . It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith , reserving infallibility , passed down by sacred tradition .

Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the principal one , celebrated liturgically in the Mass . The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ . The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven , honoured in dogmas and devotions .

  "/wiki/Unitarianism": "Unitarianism ( from Latin unitas unity , oneness , from unus one ) is a Christian theological movement named for its belief that the God in Christianity is one person , as opposed to the Trinity ( tri- from Latin tres three ) which in most other branches of Christianity defines God as one being in three persons : the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . Unitarian Christians , therefore , believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings , and he is a savior , but he was not a deity or God incarnate . As is typical of dissenters , Unitarianism does not constitute one single Christian denomination , but rather refers to a collection of both existing and extinct Christian groups , whether historically related to each other or not , which share a common theological concept of the oneness nature of God . While the uncompromising theological monotheism at the heart of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major Christian denominations which subscribe to Trinitarian theology , Christian Unitarianism is closer to the monotheistic understandings of God in Judaism , as well as the concept of the oneness of God in Islam . More so , Muslims believe that Christian Unitarianism encompasses the one true monotheistic divine message from God , perpetuated through the Abrahamic faiths that predated Islam . Unitarianism is also known for the rejection of several other Western Christian doctrines , including the doctrines of original sin , predestination , and the infallibility of the Bible . Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell , but few do today . Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism , depending on one 's stance or viewpoint , and some exclude it from that term due to its rejection of the Trinity . Despite common origins during the Protestant Reformation , some scholars call it a part of Nontrinitarianism , while others consider it both Protestant and Nontrinitarian , seeing no contradiction between those two terms . None of the three views is universally accepted . The Unitarian movement is tied to the more radical critiques of the Reformation . First organized in Eastern Europe during the Reformation , Unitarian communities have developed in Britain , South Africa , India , Canada , the United States , Jamaica , Nigeria , and Japan .",
  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",
  "/wiki/Vernacular_architecture": "Vernacular architecture is architecture characterised by the use of local materials and knowledge , usually without the supervision of professional architects . Vernacular architecture represents the majority of buildings and settlements created in pre-industrial societies and includes a very wide range of buildings , building traditions , and methods of construction . Vernacular buildings are typically simple and practical , whether residential houses or built for other purposes . Although it encompasses 95% of the world 's built environment , vernacular architecture tends to be overlooked in traditional histories of design . It is not one specific style , so it can not be distilled into a series of easy-to-digest patterns , materials , or elements . Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders , vernacular buildings are considered part of a regional culture . Vernacular architecture can be contrasted against elite or polite architecture which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building 's functional requirements . This article also covers the term traditional architecture , which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes .",

  "/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_architecture": "Anglo-Saxon architecture was a period in the history of architecture in England , and parts of Wales , from the mid-5th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066 . Anglo-Saxon secular buildings in Britain were generally simple , constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing . No universally accepted example survives above ground . There are , however , many remains of Anglo-Saxon church architecture . At least fifty churches are of Anglo-Saxon origin with major Anglo-Saxon architectural features , with many more claiming to be , although in some cases the Anglo-Saxon part is small and much-altered . It is often impossible to reliably distinguish between pre- and post-Conquest 11th century work in buildings where most parts are later additions or alterations . The round-tower church and tower-nave church are distinctive Anglo-Saxon types . All surviving churches , except one timber church , are built of stone or brick , and in some cases show evidence of re-used Roman work . The architectural character of Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical buildings range from Celtic influenced architecture in the early period ; Early Christian basilica influenced architecture ; and in the later Anglo-Saxon period , an architecture characterised by pilaster-strips , blank arcading , baluster shafts and triangular headed openings . In the last decades of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom a more general Romanesque style was introduced from the Continent , as in the now built-over additions to Westminster Abbey made from 1050 onwards , already influenced by Norman style . In recent decades architectural historians have become less confident that all undocumented minor Romanesque features post-date the Norman Conquest . Although once common , it has been incorrect for several decades to use the plain term Saxon for anything Anglo-Saxon that is later than the initial period of settlement in Britain .",
  "/wiki/Pulpit": "A pulpit is a raised stand for preachers in a Christian church . The origin of the word is the Latin pulpitum ( platform or staging ) . The traditional pulpit is raised well above the surrounding floor for audibility and visibility , accessed by steps , with sides coming to about waist height . From the late medieval period onwards , pulpits have often had a canopy known as the sounding board or abat-voix above and sometimes also behind the speaker , normally in wood . Though sometimes highly decorated , this is not purely decorative , but can have a useful acoustic effect in projecting the preacher 's voice to the congregation below . Most pulpits have one or more book-stands for the preacher to rest his or her bible , notes or texts upon . The pulpit is generally reserved for clergy . This is mandated in the regulations of the Roman Catholic church , and several others ( though not always strictly observed ) . Even in Welsh Nonconformism , this was felt appropriate , and in some chapels a second pulpit was built opposite the main one for lay exhortations , testimonials and other speeches . Many churches have a second , smaller stand called the lectern , which can be used by lay persons , and is often used for all the readings and ordinary announcements . The traditional Catholic location of the pulpit to the side of the chancel or nave has been generally retained by Anglicans and some Protestant denominations , while in Presbyterian and Evangelical churches the pulpit has often replaced the altar at the centre . Equivalent platforms for speakers are the bema ( bima , bimah ) of Ancient Greece and Jewish synagogues , and the minbar of Islamic mosques .",

  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery . Paired windows were sometimes surmounted by a simple opening such as a quatrefoil cut in plate tracery . This form gave way to the more ornate , multi-light traceried windowed .",

  "/wiki/Stained_glass": "The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it . Throughout its thousand-year history , the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings . Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows , the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture . Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight . Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages . In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived .",

  "/wiki/Timber_framing": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers , creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs . It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century . If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered , and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect . The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany . Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast . The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber . Hewing this with broadaxes , adzes , and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers ( brace and bit ) and other woodworking tools , artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building . Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world , many styles of historic framing have developed . These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation , walls , how and where the beams intersect , the use of curved timbers , and the roof framing details .",
  "/wiki/William_Penn": "William Penn ( 14 October 1644 - 30 July 1718 ) was the son of the admiral and politician Sir William Penn . Penn was a writer , early member of the Religious Society of Friends ( Quakers ) , and founder of the English North American colony the Province of Pennsylvania . He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom , notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans . Under his direction , the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed . In 1681 , King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn 's father . This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware . Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil , sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River , ( past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies ) in New Castle ( now in Delaware ) in 1682 . On this occasion , the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor , and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held . Afterward , Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia , on the west bank . However , Penn 's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch , Swedish colonists , and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware , but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland 's proprietor family , the Calverts and Lord Baltimore . These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a Pennsylvania , so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly . 23 years later in 1704 , they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware , were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware .",

Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",

  "/wiki/English_Reformation": "The English Reformation was a series of events in 16th-century England by which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church . These events were , in part , associated with the wider European Protestant Reformation , a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across western and central Europe . Causes included the invention of the printing press and increased circulation of the Bible , and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars , the upper and middle classes and readers in general . However , the various phases of the English Reformation , which also covered Wales and Ireland , were largely driven by changes in government policy , to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself . Based on Henry VIII 's desire for an annulment of his marriage ( first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527 ) , the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute . The reality of political differences between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes to come to the fore . Until the break with Rome , it was the Pope and general councils of the church that decided doctrine . Church law was governed by canon law with final jurisdiction in Rome . Church taxes were paid straight to Rome , and the Pope had the final word in the appointment of bishops . The break with Rome was effected by a series of acts of Parliament passed between 1532 and 1534 , among them the 1534 Act of Supremacy , which declared that Henry was the Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England . ( This title was renounced by Mary I in 1553 in the process of restoring papal jurisdiction ; when Elizabeth I reasserted the royal supremacy in 1559 , her title was Supreme Governor . ) Final authority in doctrinal and legal disputes now rested with the monarch , and the papacy was deprived of revenue and the final say on the appointment of bishops .",
