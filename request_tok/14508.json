  "/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Explanatory_Reporting": "The Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting has been presented since 1998 , for a distinguished example of explanatory reporting that illuminates a significant and complex subject , demonstrating mastery of the subject , lucid writing and clear presentation . From 1985 to 1997 , it was known as the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism . The Pulitzer Prize Board announced the new category in November 1984 , citing a series of explanatory articles that seven months earlier had won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing . The series , Making It Fly by Peter Rinearson of The Seattle Times , was a 29,000-word account of the development of the Boeing 757 jetliner . It had been entered in the National Reporting category , but judges moved it to Feature Writing to award it a prize . In the aftermath , the Pulitzer Prize Board said it was creating the new category in part because of the ambiguity about where explanatory accounts such as Making It Fly should be recognized . The Pulitzer Committee issues an official citation explaining the reasons for the award .",

It is one of the original Pulitzers , for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes , four of which were awarded that year . ( No Drama prize was given , however , so that one was inaugurated in 1918 , in a sense . ) It recognizes a theatrical work staged in the U.S. during the preceding calendar year . Through 2006 the Drama Prize was unlike the majority of the other Pulitzer Prizes : during these years , the eligibility period for the drama prize ran from March 1 to March 2 , to reflect the Broadway 'season ' rather than the calendar year . The decision was made , however , that the 2007 Prize would consider works staged during an eligibility period of January 1 to December 31 , 2006 - thus bringing the schedule for the Drama Prize in line with those of the other prizes . The drama jury , which consists of one academic and four critics , attends plays in New York and in regional theaters . The Pulitzer board has the authority to overrule the jury 's choice , however , as happened in 1986 when the jury chose the CIVIL warS to receive the prize , but due to the board 's opposition no award was given . In 1955 Joseph Pulitzer , Jr. pressured the prize jury into presenting the Prize to Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , which the jury considered the weakest of the five shortlisted nominees ( amateurishly constructed . from the stylistic points of view annoyingly pretentious ) , instead of Clifford Odets ' The Flowering Peach ( their preferred choice ) or The Bad Seed , their second choice .

  "/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation": "Nuclear proliferation is the spread of nuclear weapons , fissionable material , and weapons-applicable nuclear technology and information to nations not recognized as Nuclear Weapon States by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT . Proliferation has been opposed by many nations with and without nuclear weapons , as governments fear that more countries with nuclear weapons will increase the possibility of nuclear warfare ( up to and including the so-called countervalue targeting of civilians with nuclear weapons ) , de-stabilize international or regional relations , or infringe upon the national sovereignty of states . Four countries besides the five recognized Nuclear Weapons States have acquired , or are presumed to have acquired , nuclear weapons : India , Pakistan , North Korea , and Israel . None of these four is a party to the NPT , although North Korea acceded to the NPT in 1985 , then withdrew in 2003 and conducted announced nuclear tests in 2006 , 2009 , 2013 , 2016 , and 2017 . One critique of the NPT is that the treaty is discriminatory in the sense that only those countries that tested nuclear weapons before 1968 are recognized as nuclear weapon states while all other states are treated as non-nuclear-weapon states who can only join the treaty if they forswear nuclear weapons . Research into the development of nuclear weapons was initially undertaken during World War II by the United States ( in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada ) , Germany , Japan , and the USSR . The United States was the first and is the only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war , when it used two bombs against Japan in August 1945 . After surrendering to end the war , Germany and Japan ceased to be involved in any nuclear weapon research . In August 1949 , the USSR tested a nuclear weapon , becoming the second country to detonate a nuclear bomb . The United Kingdom first tested a nuclear weapon in October 1952 . France first tested a nuclear weapon in 1960 . The People 's Republic of China detonated a nuclear weapon in 1964 .",
