  "/wiki/Brazzein": "Brazzein is a sweet-tasting protein extracted from the West African fruit of the climbing plant Oubli ( Pentadiplandra brazzeana Baillon ) . It was first isolated by the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1994 . Brazzein is found in the extracellular region , in the pulp tissue surrounding the seeds . With pentadin , discovered in 1989 , brazzein is the second sweet-tasting protein discovered in the Oubli fruit . Like the other sweet proteins discovered in plants , such as monellin and thaumatin , it is extremely sweet compared to commonly used sweeteners ( 500 to 2000 times sweeter than sucrose ) . The fruit tastes sweet to humans , monkeys , and bonobos , but gorillas have mutations in their sweetness receptors so that they do not find brazzein sweet , and they are not known to eat the fruit .",
  "/wiki/Curculin": "Curculin or neoculin is a sweet protein that was discovered and isolated in 1990 from the fruit of Curculigo latifolia ( Hypoxidaceae ) , a plant from Malaysia . Like miraculin , curculin exhibits taste-modifying activity ; however , unlike miraculin , it also exhibits a sweet taste by itself . After consumption of curculin , water and sour solutions taste sweet . The plant is referred to locally as 'Lumbah ' or 'Lemba ' .",
  "/wiki/Erythritol": "Erythritol is a chemical compound , a sugar alcohol ( or polyol ) , used as a food additive and sugar substitute . Its formula is C4H10O4 , or HO ( CH2 ) ( CHOH ) 2 ( CH2 ) OH ; specifically , one particular stereoisomer with that formula . Erythritol is 60-70% as sweet as sucrose ( table sugar ) , yet it is almost noncaloric and does not affect blood sugar or cause tooth decay .",
  "/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide": "Fructooligosaccharides ( FOS ) also sometimes called oligofructose or oligofructan , are oligosaccharide fructans , used as an alternative sweetener . FOS exhibits sweetness levels between 30 and 50 percent of sugar in commercially prepared syrups . [ unreliable source ? ] It occurs naturally , and its commercial use emerged in the 1980s in response to consumer demand for healthier and calorie-reduced foods .",
  "/wiki/Glycyrrhizin": "Glycyrrhizin ( or glycyrrhizic acid or glycyrrhizinic acid ) is the chief sweet-tasting constituent of Glycyrrhiza glabra ( liquorice ) root . Structurally , it is a saponin used as an emulsifier and gel-forming agent in foodstuffs and cosmetics . Its aglycone is enoxolone assessed as a prodrug used in Japan to reduce the risk of liver cancer in people with chronic hepatitis C .",
  "/wiki/Glycerol": "Glycerol ( /\u02c8\u0261l\u026as\u0259r\u0252l/ ; also called glycerine or glycerin ) is a simple polyol compound . It is a colorless , odorless , viscous liquid that is sweet-tasting and non-toxic . The glycerol backbone is found in those lipids known as glycerides . Due to having antimicrobial and antiviral properties it is widely used in FDA approved wound and burn treatments . It can also be used as an effective marker to measure liver disease . It is also widely used as a sweetener in the food industry and as a humectant in pharmaceutical formulations . Owing to the presence of three hydroxyl groups , glycerol is miscible with water and is hygroscopic in nature .",
  "/wiki/Hydrogenated_starch_hydrolysate": "Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates ( HSHs ) are mixtures of several sugar alcohols ( a type of sugar substitute ) . Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates were developed by the Swedish company Lyckeby Starch in the 1960s . The HSH family of polyols is an approved food ingredient in Canada , Japan , and Australia . HSH sweeteners provide 40 to 90% sweetness relative to table sugar . Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are produced by the partial hydrolysis of starch - most often corn starch , but also potato starch or wheat starch . This creates dextrins ( glucose and short glucose chains ) . The hydrolyzed starch ( dextrin ) then undergoes hydrogenation to convert the dextrins to sugar alcohols . Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are similar to sorbitol : if the starch is completely hydrolyzed so that only single glucose molecules remain , then after hydrogenation the result is sorbitol . Because in HSHs the starch is not completely hydrolyzed , a mixture of sorbitol , maltitol , and longer chain hydrogenated saccharides ( such as maltotriitol ) is produced . When no single polyol is dominant in the mix , the generic name hydrogenated starch hydrolysates is used . However , if 50% or more of the polyols in the mixture are of one type , it can be labeled as sorbitol syrup , or maltitol syrup , etc .",
  "/wiki/Inulin": "Inulins are a group of naturally occurring polysaccharides produced by many types of plants , industrially most often extracted from chicory . The inulins belong to a class of dietary fibers known as fructans . Inulin is used by some plants as a means of storing energy and is typically found in roots or rhizomes . Most plants that synthesize and store inulin do not store other forms of carbohydrate such as starch . In the United States in 2018 , the Food and Drug Administration approved inulin as a dietary fiber ingredient used to improve the nutritional value of manufactured food products . Using inulin to measure kidney function is the gold standard for comparison with other means of estimating glomerular filtration rate .",
  "/wiki/Isomalt": "Isomalt is a sugar substitute , a type of sugar alcohol used primarily for its sugar-like physical properties . It has little to no impact on blood sugar levels , and does not stimulate the release of insulin . It also does not promote tooth decay , that is , it is tooth-friendly . Its energy value is 2 kcal per gram , half that of sugars . However , like most sugar alcohols , it carries a risk of gastric distress , including flatulence and diarrhea , when consumed in large quantities ( above about 20-30 g ( 1 oz ) per day ) . Isomalt may prove upsetting to the intestinal tract because it is incompletely absorbed in the small intestine , and when polyols pass into the large intestine , they can cause osmotically induced diarrhea and stimulate the gut flora , causing flatulence . As with other dietary fibers , regular consumption of isomalt can lead to desensitisation , decreasing the risk of intestinal upset . Isomalt can be blended with high-intensity sweeteners such as sucralose , giving a mixture that has the same sweetness as sugar . Isomalt is an equimolar mixture of two mutually diastereomeric disaccharides , each composed of two sugars : glucose and mannitol ( \u03b1-D-glucopyranosido-1,6-mannitol ) and also glucose and sorbitol ( \u03b1-D-glucopyranosido-1,6-sorbitol ) . Complete hydrolysis of isomalt yields glucose ( 50% ) , sorbitol ( 25% ) , and mannitol ( 25% ) . It is an odorless , white , crystalline substance containing about 5% water of crystallisation . Isomalt has a minimal cooling effect ( positive heat of solution ) , lower than many other sugar alcohols , in particular , xylitol and erythritol .",
  "/wiki/Isomaltooligosaccharide": "Isomaltooligosaccharide ( IMO ) , more commonly known as isomalto-oligosaccharide , is a mixture of short-chain carbohydrates which may have a digestion-resistant property . IMO is found naturally in some foods , as well as being manufactured commercially . Although isomaltose is found in some foods , such as honey , as a disaccharide , it behaves like all other disaccharides and is easily digested . Because of a confusion over nomenclature , such disaccharides have frequently been described as IMO , however to truly be called an oligosaccharide the molecules must have a degree of polymerization ( DP ) of three or more . Historically , the best documented source of IMO was found in sourdough breads wherein proper oligosaccharides are produced . IMO is currently produced by two distinctly different methods . One is based on a conversion of starch using enzymes . The raw material used for manufacturing IMO is starch , which is enzymatically converted into a mixture of isomaltooligosaccharides . However , IMOs produced via this method result in a very high proportion of isomaltose disaccharides ( approximately 50% ) and a majority of panose ( IMO DP3 ) as the end product . These IMO preparations have been shown to be highly digestible and generally do not exhibit much if any , digestion resistance . The second method uses bacterial fermentation and bio-conversion of sugar and starch to create an IMO variant maltosyl-isomaltooligosaccharide ( MIMO ) . Typically the end product ranges in molecular complexity from DP3 ( < 10% ) to DP9 with an average molecular weight near DP5 .",
  "/wiki/Isomaltulose": "Isomaltulose is a disaccharide carbohydrate composed of glucose and fructose . The glucose and fructose are linked by an alpha-1,6-glycosidic bond ( chemical name : 6-0-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-D-fructose ) . Isomaltulose is present in honey and sugarcane extracts . It tastes similar to sucrose ( table sugar ) with half the sweetness . Isomaltulose is also known by the trade name Palatinose , which is manufactured by enzymatic rearrangement ( isomerization ) of sucrose from beet sugar . The enzyme and its source were discovered in Germany in 1950 , and since then its physiological role and physical properties have been studied extensively . Isomaltulose has been used as an alternative to sugar in foods in Japan since 1985 , in the EU since 2005 , in the US since 2006 , and in Australia and New Zealand since 2007 , besides other countries worldwide . Analytical methods for characterization and assay of commercial isomaltulose are laid down , for example , in the Food Chemicals Codex . Its physical properties closely resemble those of sucrose , making it easy to use in existing recipes and processes . Isomaltulose is hydrogenated to produce isomalt , a minimally digestible carbohydrate that like dietary fiber is fermented in the large intestine or colon to short-chain fatty acids . Isomalt is used as a sugar replacer , for example in sugar-free candies and confectionery . Like sucrose , isomaltulose can be digested to glucose and fructose .",
