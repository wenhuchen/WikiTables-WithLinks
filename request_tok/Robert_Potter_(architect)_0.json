Enclosing the city are the mouths of the river Plym and river Tamar , which are naturally incorporated into Plymouth Sound to form a boundary with Cornwall . Plymouth 's early history extends to the Bronze Age when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten . This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire , until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton founded in the ninth century , now called Plymouth . In 1620 , the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony , the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America . During the English Civil War , the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646 . Throughout the Industrial Revolution , Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port , handling imports and passengers from the Americas , and exporting local minerals ( tin , copper , lime , china clay and arsenic ) . The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town . In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns , viz. , the county borough of Plymouth , the county borough of Devonport , and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough . The combined town took the name of Plymouth which , in 1928 , achieved city status . The city 's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II , an act known as the Plymouth Blitz . After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967 .",
