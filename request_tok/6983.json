  "/wiki/Blockade_of_Germany_(1939\u20131945)": "The Blockade of Germany ( 1939-1945 ) , also known as the Economic War , was carried out during World War II by the United Kingdom and France in order to restrict the supplies of minerals , metals , food and textiles needed by Nazi Germany - and later Fascist Italy - in order to sustain their war efforts . The economic war consisted mainly of a naval blockade , which formed part of the wider Battle of the Atlantic , and included the preclusive buying of war materials from neutral countries to prevent their sale to the enemy . There were four distinct phases of the blockade . The first period was from the beginning of European hostilities in September 1939 to the end of the Phoney War , during which the Allies and Axis Powers both intercepted neutral merchant ships to seize deliveries en route to the enemy . The blockade was rendered less effective because the Axis could get crucial materials from the Soviet Union until June 1941 , while harbours in Spain were used to import war materials for Germany . The second period began after the rapid Axis occupation of the majority of the European landmass which gave them control of major centres of industry and agriculture . The third period was from the end of 1941 after the beginning of hostilities between the United States and the Empire of Japan . The final period came after the tide of war finally turned against the Axis after heavy military defeats up to and after D-Day , which led to a gradual withdrawal from the occupied territories in the face of the overwhelming Allied military offensive .",

At its core was the Allied naval blockade of Germany , announced the day after the declaration of war , and Germany 's subsequent counter-blockade . It was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943 . The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the Kriegsmarine ( Navy ) and aircraft of the Luftwaffe ( Air Force ) against the Royal Canadian Navy , Royal Navy , United States Navy , and Allied merchant shipping . Convoys , coming mainly from North America and predominantly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union , were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces . These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States beginning September 13 , 1941 . The Germans were joined by submarines of the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on June 10 , 1940 . As an island nation , the United Kingdom was highly dependent on imported goods . Britain required more than a million tons of imported material per week in order to be able to survive and fight . In essence , the Battle of the Atlantic was a tonnage war : the Allied struggle to supply Britain and the Axis attempt to stem the flow of merchant shipping that enabled Britain to keep fighting .

While the German term refers to any submarine , the English one ( in common with several other languages ) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany , particularly in the First and Second World Wars . Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships , they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role ( commerce raiding ) and enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping . The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the British Empire , and from the United States to the United Kingdom and ( during the Second World War ) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean . German submarines also destroyed Brazilian merchant ships during World War II , causing Brazil to declare war on both Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942 . Austro-Hungarian Navy submarines were also known as U-boats .",

  "/wiki/Luftwaffe": "The Luftwaffe [ N 2 ] ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8l\u028aftvaf\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) was the aerial warfare branch of the Wehrmacht during World War II . Germany 's military air arms during World War I , the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte of the Imperial Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of theImperial Navy had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force . During the interwar period , German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in Soviet Union . With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty , the Luftwaffe 's existence was publicly acknowledged on 26 February 1935 , just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German re-armament and conscription would be announced on 16 March . The Condor Legion , a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War , provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft . Partially as a result of this combat experience , the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated , technologically advanced , and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in 1939 . By the summer of 1939 , the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight Geschwader ( wings ) . The Luftwaffe also operated Fallschirmj\u00e4ger paratrooper units . The Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940 . During the Battle of Britain , however , despite inflicting severe damage to the RAF 's infrastructure and , during the subsequent Blitz , devastating many British cities , the German air force failed to batter the beleaguered British into submission . From 1942 , Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe 's fighter arm . From late 1942 , the Luftwaffe used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise Luftwaffe Field Divisions .",

  "/wiki/Winter_War": "The Winter War [ F 7 ] was a war between the Soviet Union ( USSR ) and Finland . It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939 , three months after the outbreak of World War II , and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940 . The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation . The Soviets made several demands , including that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere , claiming security reasons - primarily the protection of Leningrad , 32 km ( 20 mi ) from the Finnish border . When Finland refused , the USSR invaded . Many sources conclude that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland , and use the establishment of the puppet Finnish Communist government and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact 's secret protocols as evidence of this , [ F 8 ] while other sources argue against the idea of the full Soviet conquest . [ F 9 ] Finland repelled Soviet attacks for more than two months and inflicted substantial losses on the invaders while temperatures ranged as low as \u221243 \u00b0C ( \u221245 \u00b0F ) . After the Soviet military reorganised and adopted different tactics , they renewed their offensive in February and overcame Finnish defences . Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty . Finland ceded 11 percent of its territory , representing 30 percent of its economy , to the Soviet Union . Soviet losses were heavy , and the country 's international reputation suffered . Soviet gains exceeded their pre-war demands and the USSR received substantial territory along Lake Ladoga and in northern Finland .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Nanking": "The Battle of Nanking ( or Nanjing ) was fought in early December 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War between the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and the Imperial Japanese Army for control of Nanking ( Nanjing ) , the capital of the Republic of China . Following the outbreak of war between Japan and China in July 1937 , the Japanese government at first attempted to contain the fighting and sought a negotiated settlement to the war . However , after victory in the Battle of Shanghai expansionists prevailed within the Japanese military and on December 1 a campaign to capture Nanking was officially authorized . The task of occupying Nanking was given to General Iwane Matsui , the commander of Japan 's Central China Area Army , who believed that the capture of Nanking would force China to surrender and thus end the war . Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek ultimately decided to defend the city and appointed Tang Shengzhi to command the Nanking Garrison Force , a hastily assembled army of local conscripts and the remnants of the Chinese units who had fought in Shanghai . Japanese soldiers marched from Shanghai to Nanking at a breakneck pace , rapidly defeating pockets of Chinese resistance . By December 9 they had reached the last line of defense , the Fukuo Line , behind which lay Nanking 's fortified walls . On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanking , and after less than two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city . Before fleeing , Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege , but by this time Nanking was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point . Most of Tang 's units simply collapsed , their soldiers often casting off their weapons and uniforms in the streets in the hopes of hiding among the city 's civilian population . Following the capture of the city Japanese soldiers massacred Chinese prisoners of war , murdered civilians , and committed acts of looting and rape in an event known as the Nanking Massacre . Though Japan 's military victory excited and emboldened them , the subsequent massacre tarnished their reputation in the eyes of the world .",

In Fall Gelb ( Case Yellow ) , German armoured units made a surprise push through the Ardennes , and then along the Somme valley , cutting off and surrounding the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium to meet the expected German invasion . When British , Belgian and French forces were pushed back to the sea by the mobile and well-organised German operation , the British evacuated the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) and French divisions from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo . German forces began Fall Rot ( Case Red ) on 5 June . The sixty remaining French divisions and two British divisions made a determined resistance but were unable to overcome the German air superiority and armoured mobility .

After the flight of the French government and the collapse of the French army , German commanders met with French officials on 18 June to negotiate an end to hostilities ."
