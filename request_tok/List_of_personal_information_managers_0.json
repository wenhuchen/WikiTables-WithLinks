  "/wiki/3D_Topicscape": "3D Topicscape , a software application , is a Personal Information Manager that provides a template loosely based on mind-mapping or concept mapping . It presents the mind map as a 3D scene where each node is a cone ( or pyramid , or variation on such a shape ) . It can also display in a 2D format . Nodes are arranged in a way that indicates how they are related in much the same way as a mind map . In addition to its use for information management it is claimed to be suitable as a task manager , and for use in project management . A Topicscape is created by importing folders ( by Drag-and-drop or menus ) , importing from other mind mapping software including FreeMind , PersonalBrain and MindManager or by hand with mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts . Import sources may be converted to a new Topicscape or added as a portion of an existing one . The number of levels that can be stored is not limited , but up to seven levels of the hierarchy may be viewed at once . Any node may be chosen as the centre of the 3D scene and choosing one at the edge will cause more to come into view . Topicscape 's most obvious difference from 2D mind mapping software is that it provides a zooming interface and simulates flying as noted by Wall Street Journal columnist Jeremy Wagstaff in his column Fly through your computer . The BBC World Service and PC World have also reviewed 3D Topicscape .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

The macOS version was known as iCal before the release of OS X Mountain Lion in July 2012 . Originally released as a free download for Mac OS X v10.2 on September 10 , 2002 , it was bundled with the operating system as iCal 1.5 with the release of Mac OS X v10.3 . iCal was the first calendar application for Mac OS X to offer support for multiple calendars and the ability to intermittently publish/subscribe to calendars on WebDAV servers . Version 2 of iCal was released as part of Mac OS X v10.4 , Version 3 as part of Mac OS X v10.5 , Version 4 as part of Mac OS X v10.6 , Version 5 as part of Mac OS X v10.7 , Version 6 as part of OS X v10.8 , Version 7 as part of OS X v10.9 , Version 8 as part of OS X v10.10 and OS X v10.11 , and version 9 as part of macOS v10.12 . Apple licensed the iCal name from Brown Bear Software , who have used it for their iCal application since 1997. iCal 's initial development was quite different from other Apple software : it was designed independently by a small French team working secretly in Paris , led by Jean-Marie Hullot , a friend of Steve Jobs . iCal 's development has since been transferred to Apple US headquarters in Cupertino .",

The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server .

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) .

  "/wiki/Unix": "Unix ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u026aks/ ; trademarked as UNIX ) is a family of multitasking , multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT & T Unix , development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , and others . Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows . Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system : almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language , thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms .",

Users can enable or disable the visibility of special calendars , including Birthdays , where the app retrieves dates of births from Google contacts and displays birthday cards on a yearly basis , and Holidays , a country-specific calendar that displays dates of special occasions .
