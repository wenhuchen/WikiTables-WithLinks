  "/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union": "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) [ b ] was the founding and ruling political party of the Soviet Union . The CPSU was the sole governing party of the Soviet Union until 1990 , when the Congress of People 's Deputies modified Article 6 of the most recent 1977 Soviet constitution , which had granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system . The party was founded in 1912 by the Bolsheviks , a majority faction detached from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party , led by Vladimir Lenin , who seized power in the October Revolution of 1917 . After 74 years , it was dissolved on 29 August 1991 on Soviet territory , soon after a failed coup d'\u00e9tat by hard-line CPSU leaders against Soviet president and party general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev . It was completely outlawed three months later on 6 November 1991 on Russian territory . The CPSU was a Communist party , organized on the basis of democratic centralism . This principle , conceived by Lenin , entails democratic and open discussion of policy issues within the party followed by the requirement of total unity in upholding the agreed policies . The highest body within the CPSU was the Party Congress , which convened every five years . When the Congress was not in session , the Central Committee was the highest body . Because the Central Committee met twice a year , most day-to-day duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo , ( previously the Presidium ) , the Secretariat and the Orgburo ( until 1952 ) . The party leader was the head of government and held the office of either General Secretary , Premier or head of state , or some of the three offices concurrently - but never all three at the same time . The party leader was the de facto chairman of the CPSU Politburo and chief executive of the Soviet Union .",
  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",
  "/wiki/October_Revolution": "The October Revolution , [ a ] officially known in Soviet historiography as the Great October Socialist Revolution [ b ] and commonly referred to as the October Uprising , the October Coup , the Bolshevik Revolution , the Bolshevik Coup , or the Red October , was a revolution in Russia led by the Bolshevik Party of Vladimir Lenin that was instrumental in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917-1923 . It took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd on 25 October ( Old Style , O.S . ; 7 November , New Style or N.S . ) 1917 . The October Revolution had followed and capitalized on the February Revolution earlier in the year . The February Revolution had overthrown the Tsarist autocracy , resulting in a provisional government . The provisional government had taken power after being proclaimed by Grand Duke Michael , Tsar Nicholas II 's younger brother , declined to take power after the Tsar had stepped down . During this time , urban workers began to organize into councils ( soviets ) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions . After the Congress of Soviets , the new governing body , had its second session it elected members of the Bolsheviks and other left-wing groups such as the Left Socialist Revolutionaries ( Left SR ) to important positions within the new state of affairs . This immediately initiated the establishment of the Russian Soviet Republic . On 17 July 1918 , [ c ] the Tsar and his family , including his five children aged 13 to 22 , were executed . The revolution was led by the Bolsheviks , who used their influence in the Petrograd Soviet to organize the armed forces .",
  "/wiki/General_Secretary": "Secretary is a title often used in organizations to indicate a person having a certain amount of authority , power , or importance in the organization . Secretaries announce important events and communicate to the organization . The term is derived from the Latin word secernere , to distinguish or to set apart , the passive participle ( secretum ) meaning having been set apart , with the eventual connotation of something private or confidential , as with the English word secret . A secretarius was a person , therefore , overseeing business confidentially , usually for a powerful individual ( a king , pope , etc. ) . The official title of the leader of most communist and socialist political parties is the General Secretary of the Central Committee or First Secretary of the Central Committee . When a communist party is in power , the General Secretary is usually the country 's de facto leader ( though sometimes this leader also holds state-level positions to monopolize power , such as a presidency or premiership in order to constitute de jure leadership of the state ) , such as China and Cuba . In England , the term secretarius was used from the beginning of the thirteenth century in the varying meanings of a confidential clerk , an ambassador , or a member of the king 's council . In the fourteenth century , the title became strongly associated with the keeper of the king 's signet . From the Renaissance to the late 19th century , men involved in the daily correspondence and the activities of the powerful assumed the title of secretary . With time , like many titles , the term was applied to more and varied functions , leading to compound titles to specify the authority associated with its use , like general secretary or financial secretary . In some countries , such as the United States , the term secretary is used to indicate the holder of a cabinet-level post . There are a number of popular variations of the title used to indicate that the secretary in question has a high degree of authority , such as general secretary ( or , following usage in the Norman language , secretary-general ) , first secretary , and executive secretary .",
  "/wiki/Joseph_Stalin": "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin [ b ] ( born Ioseb Besarionis dz\u0435 Jughashvili ; [ a ] 18 December [ O.S . 6 December ] 1878 - 5 March 1953 ) was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet politician who led the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until 1953 as the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( 1922-1952 ) and premier of the Soviet Union ( 1941-1953 ) . Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership , he eventually consolidated power to become the country 's de facto dictator by the 1930s . A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism , Stalin formalised these ideas as Marxism-Leninism , while his own policies are known as Stalinism . Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire ( now Georgia ) , Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth . He edited the party 's newspaper , Pravda , and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin 's Bolshevik faction via robberies , kidnappings , and protection rackets . Repeatedly arrested , he underwent several internal exiles . After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution and created a one-party state under Lenin 's newly renamed Communist Party , Stalin joined its governing Politburo . Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union 's establishment in 1922 , Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin 's 1924 death . Under Stalin , Socialism in One Country became a central tenet of the party 's dogma . Through the Five-Year Plans , the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation , creating a centralised command economy . This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the famine of 1932-33 .",
  "/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev": "Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev [ a ] ( 15 April [ O.S . 3 April ] 1894 - 11 September 1971 ) was a Soviet statesman who led the Soviet Union during part of the Cold War as the first secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964 and as chairman of the Council of Ministers ( or premier ) from 1958 to 1964 . Khrushchev was responsible for the de-Stalinization of the Soviet Union , for backing the progress of the early Soviet space program , and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy . Khrushchev 's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964 , replacing him with Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Premier . Khrushchev was born in 1894 in the village of Kalinovka , close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine . He was employed as a metal worker during his youth , and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War . With the help of Lazar Kaganovich , he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy . He supported Joseph Stalin 's purges , and approved thousands of arrests . In 1938 , Stalin sent him to govern the Ukrainian SSR , and he continued the purges there . During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War ( Eastern Front of World War II ) , Khrushchev was again a commissar , serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals . Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of Stalingrad , a fact he took great pride in throughout his life . After the war , he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin 's close advisers .",

His 18-year term as general secretary was second only to Joseph Stalin 's in duration . While Brezhnev 's rule was characterized by political stability and notable foreign policy successes , it was also marked by corruption , inefficiency , and rapidly growing technological gaps with the West .

Upon the Soviet Union 's formation in the aftermath of the 1917 October Revolution , Brezhnev joined the Soviet Communist party 's youth league in 1923 . He became an official party member in 1929 . When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 , he joined the Red Army as a commissar and rose rapidly through the ranks to become a major general during World War II . Brezhnev was promoted to the Central Committee in 1952 and became a full member of the Politburo in 1957 . In 1964 he ousted Nikita Khrushchev and took over as First Secretary of the CPSU , the most powerful position in the Kremlin . Brezhnev 's conservative , pragmatic approach to leadership significantly stabilized the position of the Soviet Union and its ruling party .",
  "/wiki/Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany": "The Socialist Unity Party of Germany ( German : Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands , SED ) , often known in English as the East German Communist Party , was the governing Marxist-Leninist political party of the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ; East Germany ) from the country 's foundation in October 1949 until its dissolution after the Peaceful Revolution in 1989 . The party was established in April 1946 . The GDR was a one-party state but other institutional popular front parties were permitted to exist in alliance with the SED , these parties being the Christian Democratic Union , the Liberal Democratic Party , the Democratic Farmers ' Party , and the National Democratic Party . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . In the 1980s , the SED rejected the liberalisation policies of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , such as perestroika and glasnost , which would lead to the GDR 's isolation from the restructuring USSR and the party 's downfall in the autumn of 1989 . Walter Ulbricht was the party 's dominant figure and effective leader of East Germany from 1950 to 1971 . In 1953 , an uprising against the Party was met with violent suppression by the Ministry of State Security and the Soviet Army . In 1971 , Ulbricht was succeeded by Erich Honecker who presided over a stable period in the development of the GDR until he was forced to step down during the 1989 revolution . The party 's last leader , Egon Krenz , was unsuccessful in his attempt to retain the SED 's hold on political governance of the GDR and was imprisoned after German reunification . The SED 's long-suppressed reform wing took over the party in the autumn of 1989 . In hopes of changing its image , on 16 December it renamed itself the Party of Democratic Socialism ( PDS ) , abandoning Marxism-Leninism and declaring itself a democratic socialist party .

Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",

Ulbricht played a leading role in the creation of the Weimar-era Communist Party of Germany ( KPD ) and later ( after spending the years of Nazi rule in exile in France and the Soviet Union ) in the early development and establishment of the German Democratic Republic in East Germany . As the First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party from 1950 to 1971 , he was the chief decision maker in East Germany . From President Wilhelm Pieck 's death in 1960 on , he was also the East German head of state until his own death in 1973 . Ulbricht began his political life during the German Empire , when he joined first the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) in 1912 , the anti-World War I Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany ( USPD ) in 1917 and deserted the Imperial German Army in 1918 . He joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1920 and became a leading party functionary , serving in its Central Committee from 1923 onward . After the Nazi takeover of Germany in 1933 , Ulbricht lived in Paris and Prague from 1933 to 1937 and in the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1945 . After the end of World War II , Ulbricht re-organized the German Communist Party in the Soviet occupation zone along Stalinist lines . He played a key role in the forcible merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany ( SED ) in 1946 . He became the First Secretary of the SED and effective leader of the recently established East Germany in 1950 . The Soviet Army occupation force violently suppressed the uprising of 1953 in East Germany on 17 June 1953 , while Ulbricht hid in the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin-Karlshorst .

As party leader he worked closely with Moscow ( which had a large army stationed in East Germany ) . He controlled the government of the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) from 1971 until he was forced out in the weeks preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989 . From 1976 onward he was also the country 's official head of state as Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic following Willi Stoph 's relinquishment of the post . Honecker 's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany , a position for which he was imprisoned by the Nazi government of Germany . Following World War II , he was freed by the Soviet army and relaunched his political activities , founding the youth organisation the Free German Youth in 1946 and serving as the group 's chairman until 1955 . As the Security Secretary of the Partys Central Committee in the new East Germany , he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and , in this function , bore responsibility for the order to fire along the Inner German border . In 1970 , he initiated a political power struggle that led , with support of the Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev , to his replacing Walter Ulbricht as First Secretary of the Central Committee and as chairman of the state 's National Defense Council . Under his command , the country adopted a programme of consumer socialism and moved toward the international community by normalising relations with West Germany and also becoming a full member of the UN , in what is considered one of his greatest political successes . As Cold War tensions eased in the late 1980s with the advent of perestroika and glasnost - the liberal reforms introduced by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev - Honecker refused all but cosmetic changes to the East German political system . He cited the continual hardliner attitudes of Kim Il-sung and Fidel Castro , whose respective regimes of North Korea and Cuba had been critical of reforms . As anticommunist protests grew , Honecker begged Gorbachev to intervene with the Soviet army to suppress the protests in order to maintain communist rule in East Germany as Moscow had done with Czechoslovakia in the Prague Spring of 1968 and with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 ; Gorbachev refused .",

From 1944 to 1946 , it was known as the Democratic Government of Albania and from 1946 to 1976 it was known as the People 's Republic of Albania . Throughout this period , the country was ruled by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania . They ruled Albania by establishing a Stalinist style of state administration and adhering to policies which stressed national unity and self-reliance . Travel and visa restrictions made Albania one of the most difficult countries to visit or travel from . In 1967 , it declared itself the world 's first atheist state . But after the end of its communist regime in 1991 , the practice of religion slowly increased . It was the only Warsaw Pact member to formally withdraw from the alliance before 1990 , an action which was occasioned by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 . The government implemented reforms which were aimed at modernizing Albania and they resulted in significant gains in the areas of industry , agriculture , education , the arts , and culture , which contributed to a general increase in the Albanian population 's standard of living . However , these developments coincided with political repression by the secret police , the Sigurimi , for the purposes of preventing a counter-revolution , which included dismissal from employment , imprisonment in forced labor camps and executions . The first multi-party elections in Socialist Albania took place on 31 March 1991 - the Communists gained a majority in an interim government and the country 's first parliamentary elections were held on 22 March 1992 .

Successor to the pro-Bolshevik wing of the Socialist Party of Romania , it gave ideological endorsement to a communist revolution to overthrow the Kingdom of Romania . The PCR was a minor and illegal grouping for much of the interwar period , and submitted to direct Comintern control .

  "/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Romania": "The Socialist Republic of Romania ( Romanian : Republica Socialist\u0103 Rom\u00e2nia , RSR ) refers to Romania under Marxist-Leninist one-party communist rule that existed officially from 1947 to 1989 . From 1947 to 1965 , the state was known as the Romanian People 's Republic ( Republica Popular\u0103 Rom\u00een\u0103 , RPR ) . The country was a Soviet-aligned Eastern Bloc state with a dominant role for the Romanian Communist Party enshrined in its constitutions . As World War II ended , Romania , a former Axis member , was occupied by the Soviet Union , the sole representative of the Allies . On 6 March 1945 , after mass demonstrations by communist sympathizers and political pressure from the Soviet representative of the Allied Control Commission , a new pro-Soviet government that included members of the previously outlawed Romanian Workers ' Party was installed . Gradually , more members of the Workers ' Party and communist-aligned parties gained control of the administration and pre-war political leaders were steadily eliminated from political life . In December 1947 , King Michael was coerced to abdicate and the People 's Republic of Romania was declared . At first , Romania 's scarce post-war resources were drained by the SovRoms , new tax-exempt Soviet-Romanian companies that allowed the Soviet Union to control Romania 's major sources of income . Another drain was the war reparations paid to the Soviet Union . In the 1950s , however , Romania 's communist government began to assert more independence , inducing , for example , the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Romania by 1958 . In the 1960s and 1970s , Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu became General Secretary of the Communist Party ( 1965 ) , Chairman of the State Council ( 1967 ) and assumed the newly established role of President in 1974 .

Gheorghiu-Dej stepped up measures that greatly increased trade relations between Romania and the Western countries . However , at the same time his government was accused of human rights violations within the country . He died of lung cancer in March 1965 .

He was the general secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 to 1989 and hence the second and last Communist leader of Romania . He was also the country 's head of state from 1967 , serving as President of the State Council and from 1974 concurrently as President of the Republic until his overthrow and execution in the Romanian Revolution in December 1989 , part of a series of anti-Communist and anti-Soviet Union uprisings in Eastern Europe that year . Born in 1918 in Scornice\u0219ti , Olt County , Ceau\u0219escu was a member of the Romanian Communist youth movement . Ceau\u0219escu rose up through the ranks of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej 's Socialist government and , upon Gheorghiu-Dej 's death in 1965 , he succeeded to the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party as general secretary . Upon his rise to power , he eased press censorship and openly condemned the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in his speech on 21 August 1968 , which resulted in a surge in popularity . However , the resulting period of stability was very brief as his government very soon became severely totalitarian and was considered the most repressive in the Eastern Bloc at the time . His secret police , the Securitate , was responsible for mass surveillance as well as severe repression and human rights abuses within the country and he suppressed and controlled the media and press , implementing methods that were among the harshest , most restrictive and brutal in the world . Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to skyrocketing foreign debts for Romania . In 1982 , he exported much of the country 's agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay them . The shortages that followed drastically lowered living standards , leading to heavy rationing of food , water , oil , heat , electricity , medicine and other necessities . His cult of personality experienced unprecedented elevation , followed by extensive nepotism and the intense deterioration of foreign relations , even with the Soviet Union .",

It was formed by a merger of the Hungarian Communist Party ( MKP ) and the Hungarian Social Democratic Party . Ostensibly a union of equals , the merger had actually occurred as a result of massive pressure brought to bear on the Social Democrats by both the Hungarian Communists , as well as the Soviet Union . The few independent-minded Social Democrats who had not been sidelined by Communist salami tactics were pushed out in short order after the merger , leaving the party as essentially the MKP under a new name .

Other minor legal Hungarian political parties were allowed to continue as independent coalition parties until late 1949 , but were completely subservient to the MDP . During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 , the party was reorganised into the Hungarian Socialist Workers ' Party ( MSZMP ) by a circle of communists around K\u00e1d\u00e1r and Imre Nagy . The new government of Nagy declared to assess the uprising not as counter-revolutionary but as a great , national and democratic event and to dissolve State Security Police ( \u00c1VH ) . Hungary 's declaration to become neutral and to exit the Warsaw Pact , caused the second Soviet intervention on 4 November 1956 .

It was designated a people 's democratic republic by the Soviet Union in the 1940s . Geographically , it bordered Romania and the Soviet Union ( via the Ukrainian SSR ) to the east ; Yugoslavia to the southwest ; Czechoslovakia to the north and Austria to the west . Having emasculated most of the other parties , the Communists spent the next year and a half consolidating their hold on power . This culminated in October 1947 , when the Communists told their non-Communist coalition partners that they had to cooperate with a reconfigured coalition government if they wanted to stay in the country . In June 1948 the Communists forced the Social Democrats to merge with them to form the Hungarian Working People 's Party ( MDP ) .

In the 1960s , the BCP announced some economic reforms , which allowed the free sale of production that exceeded planned amounts .

Varying degrees of conservative or liberal influence followed . After a new energy and transportation infrastructure was constructed , by 1960 manufacturing became the dominant sector of the economy and Bulgaria became a major exporter of household goods and later on computer technologies , earning it the nickname of Silicon Valley of the Eastern Bloc . The country 's relatively high productivity levels and high scores on social development rankings made it a model for other socialist countries ' administrative policies .

He became First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party ( BCP ) in 1954-General Secretary from April 1981-and from 1978 concurrently as President of the Republic remained on this position for 35 years , until 1989 , thus becoming the second longest-serving leader of any Eastern Bloc nation after World War II , and one of the longest ruling non-royal leaders in modern history . His rule marked a period of unprecedented political and economic stability for Bulgaria , marked both by complete submission of Bulgaria to Soviet directives and a desire for expanding ties with the West . His rule remained unchallenged until the deterioration of east-west relations in the 1980s , when a stagnating economic situation , a worsening international image and growing careerism and corruption in the BCP weakened his positions . He resigned on 10 November 1989 , under pressure by senior BCP members due to his refusal to recognize problems and deal with public protests . Within a month of Zhivkov 's ouster , Communist rule in Bulgaria had effectively ended , and within nearly a year the People 's Republic of Bulgaria had formally ceased to exist .",
  "/wiki/League_of_Communists_of_Yugoslavia": "The League of Communists of Yugoslavia , [ a ] known until 1952 as the Communist Party of Yugoslavia , [ b ] was the founding and ruling party of SFR Yugoslavia . It was formed in 1919 as the main communist opposition party in the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes and after its initial successes in the elections , it was proscribed by the royal government and was at times harshly and violently suppressed . It remained an illegal underground group until World War II when , after the Invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941 , the military arm of the party , the Yugoslav Partisans , became embroiled in a bloody civil war and defeated the Axis powers and their local auxiliaries . After the liberation from foreign occupation in 1945 , the party consolidated its power and established a single-party state , which existed until the 1990 breakup of Yugoslavia . The party , which was led by Josip Broz Tito from 1937 to 1980 , was the first communist party in power in the history of the Eastern Bloc that openly opposed the Soviet Union and thus was expelled from the Cominform in 1948 in what is known as the Tito-Stalin Split . After internal purges of pro-Soviet members , the party renamed itself the League of Communists and adopted the politics of workers ' self-management and independent communism , known as Titoism .",
  "/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia": "The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) , also known as SFR Yugoslavia or simply Yugoslavia , was a country located in Central and Southeastern Europe that existed from its foundation in the aftermath of World War II until its dissolution in 1992 amid the Yugoslav Wars . Covering an area of 255,804 km\u00b2 ( 98,766 sq mi ) , the SFRY was bordered by the Adriatic Sea and Italy to the west , Austria and Hungary to the north , Bulgaria and Romania to the east , and Albania and Greece to the south . The nation was a socialist state and a federation governed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and made up of six socialist republics - Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , Montenegro , Serbia , and Slovenia - with Belgrade as its capital . In addition , it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia : Kosovo and Vojvodina . The SFRY 's origin is traced to 26 November 1942 , when the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia was formed during World War II . On 29 November 1945 , the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed after the deposition of King Peter II , thus ending the monarchy . Until 1948 , the new communist government originally sided with the Eastern Bloc under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito at the beginning of the Cold War , but after the Tito-Stalin split of 1948 , Yugoslavia pursued a policy of neutrality . It became one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement , and transitioned from a command economy to market-based socialism . The SFRY maintained neutrality during the Cold War as part of its foreign policy . It was a founding member of CERN , the United Nations , Non-Aligned Movement , OSCE , IFAD , WTO , Eutelsat , and BTWC . Following the death of Tito on 4 May 1980 , the Yugoslav economy started to collapse , which increased unemployment and inflation . The economic crisis led to a rise in ethnic nationalism in the late 1980s and early 1990s ; dissidence resulted among the multiple ethnicities within the constituent republics .",
