  "/wiki/Alta_Wind_Energy_Center": "Alta Wind Energy Center ( AWEC ) , also known as Mojave Wind Farm , is the third largest onshore wind energy project in the world . The Alta Wind Energy Center is a wind farm located in Tehachapi Pass of the Tehachapi Mountains , in Kern County , California . As of 2013 , it is the largest wind farm in the United States , with a combined installed capacity of 1,550 MW ( 2,080,000 hp ) . The project , being developed near Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm - site of the first large-scale wind farms installed in the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s - is a powerful illustration of the growing size and scope of modern wind projects . Southern California Edison has agreed to a 25-year power purchase agreement for the power produced as part of the power purchase agreements for up to 1,500 MW ( 2,000,000 hp ) or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the Tehachapi area . The project will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 5.2 million metric tons , which is equivalent to taking 446,000 cars off the road . A total of 3,000 MW ( 4,000,000 hp ) is planned . The wind farm was developed by Terra-Gen Power which closed a US $ 1.2 billion financing deal in July 2010 with partners that included Citibank , Barclays Capital , and Credit Suisse . After many delays , the first phase began construction in 2010. Financing for additional phases of $ 650 million was secured in April 2012 . Construction of the Alta Wind Energy Center is expected to create more than 3,000 domestic manufacturing , construction , and maintenance jobs , and contribute more than one billion dollars to the local economy .
