  "/wiki/USS_Arizona_(BB-39)": "USS Arizona was a Pennsylvania-class battleship built for the United States Navy in the mid-1910s . Named in honor of the 48th state 's recent admission into the union , the ship was the second and last of the Pennsylvania class of super-dreadnought battleships . Although commissioned in 1916 , the ship remained stateside during World War I . Shortly after the end of the war , Arizona was one of a number of American ships that briefly escorted President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference . The ship was sent to Turkey in 1919 at the beginning of the Greco-Turkish War to represent American interests for several months . Several years later , she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and remained there for the rest of her career . Aside from a comprehensive modernization in 1929-1931 , Arizona was regularly used for training exercises between the wars , including the annual Fleet Problems ( training exercises ) . When an earthquake struck Long Beach , California , on 10 March 1933 , Arizona 's crew provided aid to the survivors . In July 1934 , the ship was featured in a James Cagney film , Here Comes the Navy , about the romantic troubles of a sailor . In April 1940 , she and the rest of the Pacific Fleet were transferred from California to Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , as a deterrent to Japanese imperialism . Arizona was hit by Japanese torpedo bombers during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 . After one of their bombs detonated in a magazine , she exploded violently and sank , with the loss of 1,177 officers and crewmen .",
  "/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor": "The attack on Pearl Harbor [ nb 3 ] was a surprise , preemptive military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service upon the United States ( a neutral country at the time ) against the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu , Territory of Hawaii , just before 08:00 , on Sunday morning , December 7 , 1941 . The attack led to the United States ' formal entry into World War II the next day . The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI , and as Operation Z during its planning . Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States . Over the course of seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines , Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong . The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time ( 18:18 GMT ) . [ nb 4 ] The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft ( including fighters , level and dive bombers , and torpedo bombers ) in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers . All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged , with four sunk . All but USS Arizona were later raised , and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war . The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , [ nb 5 ] and one minelayer . 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded .

  "/wiki/USS_West_Virginia_(BB-48)": "USS West Virginia ( BB-48 ) was the fourth dreadnought battleship of the Colorado class , though because Washington was cancelled , she was the third and final member of the class to be completed . The Colorado class proved to be the culmination of the standard-type battleship series built for the United States Navy in the 1910s and 1920s ; the ships were essentially repeats of the earlier Tennessee design , but with a significantly more powerful main battery of eight 16-inch ( 406 mm ) guns in twin-gun turrets . West Virginia was built between her keel laying in 1920 and her commissioning into the Navy in 1923 . The ship spent the 1920s and 1930s conducting routine training exercises , including the typically-annual Fleet Problems , which provided invaluable experience for the coming war in the Pacific . West Virginia was moored in Battleship Row on the morning of 7 December 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor , bringing the United States into World War II . Badly damaged by torpedoes , the ship sank in the shallow water but was later refloated and extensively rebuilt over the course of 1943 and into mid-1944 . She returned to service in time for the Philippines Campaign , where she led the American line of battle at the Battle of Surigao Strait on the night of 24-25 October . There , she was one of the few American battleships to use her radar to acquire a target in the darkness , allowing her to engage a Japanese squadron in what was the final action between battleships in naval history . After Surigao Strait , the ship remained in the Philippines to support troops fighting during the Battle of Leyte in 1944 and then supported the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in early 1945 . The ship also took part in the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa later that year , providing extensive fire support to the ground forces invading those islands . During the latter operation , she was hit by a kamikaze that did little damage . Following the surrender of Japan , West Virginia took part in the initial occupation and thereafter participated in Operation Magic Carpet , carrying soldiers and sailors from Hawaii to the mainland United States before being deactivated in 1946 .",

  "/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal": "The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , sometimes referred to as the Third and Fourth Battles of Savo Island , the Battle of the Solomons , the Battle of Friday the 13th , or , in Japanese sources , the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea ( \u7b2c\u4e09\u6b21\u30bd\u30ed\u30e2\u30f3\u6d77\u6226 , Dai-san-ji Soromon Kaisen ) , took place from 12-15 November 1942 , and was the decisive engagement in a series of naval battles between Allied ( primarily American ) and Imperial Japanese forces during the months-long Guadalcanal Campaign in the Solomon Islands during World War II . The action consisted of combined air and sea engagements over four days , most near Guadalcanal and all related to a Japanese effort to reinforce land forces on the island . The only two U.S. Navy admirals to be killed in a surface engagement in the war were lost in this battle . Allied forces landed on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield , later called Henderson Field , that was under construction by the Japanese military . There were several subsequent attempts to recapture the airfield by the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship , efforts which ultimately failed . In early November 1942 , the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield . Several Japanese warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field with the goal of destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy . Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort , U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal . In the resulting battle , both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night . Nevertheless , the U.S. succeeded in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships . Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal . Thus , the battle turned back Japan 's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi , resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor .",

The naval battle was the second of four major surface engagements during the Guadalcanal campaign and took place at the entrance to the strait between Savo Island and Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands . Cape Esperance ( 9\u00b015\u2032S 159\u00b042\u2032E / 9.250\u00b0S 159.700\u00b0E / -9.250 ; 159.700 ( Cape Esperance ) ) is the northernmost point on Guadalcanal , and the battle took its name from this point . On the night of 11 October , Japanese naval forces in the Solomon Islands area - under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa - sent a major supply and reinforcement convoy to their forces on Guadalcanal . The convoy consisted of two seaplane tenders and six destroyers and was commanded by Rear Admiral Takatsugu Jojima . At the same time , but in a separate operation , three heavy cruisers and two destroyers - under the command of Rear Admiral Aritomo Got\u014d - were to bombard the Allied airfield on Guadalcanal ( called Henderson Field by the Allies ) with the object of destroying Allied aircraft and the airfield 's facilities . Shortly before midnight on 11 October , a U.S. force of four cruisers and five destroyers - under the command of Rear Admiral Norman Scott - intercepted Got\u014d 's force as it approached Savo Island near Guadalcanal . Taking the Japanese by surprise , Scott 's warships sank one of Got\u014d 's cruisers and one of his destroyers , heavily damaged another cruiser , mortally wounded Got\u014d , and forced the rest of Got\u014d 's warships to abandon the bombardment mission and retreat . During the exchange of gunfire , one of Scott 's destroyers was sunk and one cruiser and another destroyer were heavily damaged . In the meantime , the Japanese supply convoy successfully completed unloading at Guadalcanal and began its return journey without being discovered by Scott 's force . Later on the morning of 12 October , four Japanese destroyers from the supply convoy turned back to assist Got\u014d 's retreating , damaged warships . Air attacks by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field sank two of these destroyers later that day .",

It was the only major action in the larger battle in which the Americans were largely unprepared . The Battle off Samar has been cited by historians as one of the greatest last stands in naval history . Admiral William Halsey , Jr. was lured into taking his powerful 3rd Fleet after a decoy fleet , taking with him every ship in the area that he had the power to command . The only remaining American forces in the area were three escort carrier groups of the 7th Fleet . The escort carriers and destroyer escorts which had been designed to protect slow convoys from submarine attack had been repurposed to attack ground targets and had few torpedoes , as they normally relied on Halsey 's fleet to protect them from armored warships . A Japanese surface force of battleships and cruisers , battered earlier in the larger battle and thought to have been in retreat , instead turned around unobserved and encountered the northernmost of the three groups , Task Unit 77.4.3 ( Taffy 3 ) , commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague . Taffy 3 's three destroyers and four destroyer escorts possessed neither the firepower nor the armor to effectively oppose the 23 ships of the Japanese force , but nevertheless desperately attacked with 5/38 caliber guns and torpedoes to cover the retreat of their slow jeep carriers . Aircraft from the carriers of Taffy 1 , 2 , and 3 , including FM-2 Wildcats , F6F Hellcats and TBM Avengers , strafed , bombed , torpedoed , rocketed , depth-charged , fired at least one .38 caliber handgun and made numerous dry runs at the Japanese force when they ran out of ammunition . Sprague 's task unit lost two escort carriers , two destroyers , a destroyer escort , and several aircraft . Over a thousand Americans died , comparable to the combined losses of American men and ships at the better-known Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway . But in exchange for the heavy losses for such a small force , they sank three Japanese cruisers , disabled another three , and caused enough confusion to persuade the Japanese commander , Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita , to regroup and ultimately withdraw , rather than advancing to sink troop and supply ships in Leyte Gulf .",

The other six boats of the squadron remained at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , and were there when war broke out , eventually being shipped to the Solomons . After the outbreak of hostilities between the United States and Japan on 7 December 1941 , the squadron moved from Cavite to Sisiman Bay [ note 1 ] on the Bataan Peninsula with the requisitioned tug Trabajador as tender , where it helped in the defense of Bataan and Corregidor during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines . PT-31 and PT-33 were sunk during the battle . The desired practice was for boats to patrol in pairs in the event one PT needed assistance from another . The critical shortage of spares and fuel often prevented such pairing so that one of the small converted patrol yachts , Maryann , Perry , or Fisheries II , or one of the two old destroyers , Peary or Pillsbury , were used to accompany a single PT on patrol . On 11 March 1942 , the remaining boats of the squadron transported General Douglas MacArthur and several high-ranking officers from Corregidor to Mindanao , an act which earned every member of the squadron the Silver Star . PT-32 was abandoned during this mission , reducing the squadron to three boats : PT-41 , PT-34 , and PT-35 . These three boats were based at Mindanao until mid-April 1942 , where two of them ( PT-41 and PT-34 ) attacked the Japanese cruiser Kuma , scoring at least one hit . This was to be the squadron 's last action : PT-34 was destroyed by Japanese aircraft , PT-35 had to be scuttled to avoid capture , and PT-41 was commandeered by the U.S. Army to defend Lake Lanao . She was scuttled as well , three days after transfer .",
  "/wiki/General_of_the_Army_(United_States)": "General of the Army ( abbreviated as GA ) is a five-star general officer and the second highest possible rank in the United States Army . A General of the Army ranks immediately above a general and is equivalent to a fleet admiral and a General of the Air Force . The General of the Army insignia consisted of five 3/8th inch stars in a pentagonal pattern , with points touching . The insignia was paired with the gold and enameled United States Coat of Arms on service coat shoulder loops . The silver colored five-star metal insignia alone would be worn for use as a collar insignia of grade and on the garrison cap . Soft shoulder epaulettes with five 7/16th inch stars in silver thread and gold-threaded United States Coat of Arms on green cloth were worn with shirts and sweaters . The rank of General of the Army has had two incarnations . The rank was introduced in 1866 , the year after the American Civil War . It was reserved for the Commanding General of the United States Army , was a four-star rank , and was held by three different individuals from 1866 to 1888 . The rank was revived as the modern five-star rank during World War II , and may be awarded to more than one serving officer at a time . It was held by five different individuals from 1944 to 1981 . A special rank of General of the Armies , which ranks above General of the Army , exists but has been conferred only twice , to World War I 's John J. Pershing , and posthumously to George Washington , by proclamation 177 years after his death .",
