  "/wiki/Woody_Allen": "Heywood Woody Allen ( born Allan Stewart Konigsberg ; December 1 , 1935 ) is an American director , writer , actor , and comedian whose career spans more than six decades . He began his career as a comedy writer in the 1950s , writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces . In the early 1960s , he performed as a stand-up comedian , emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes , where he developed the persona of an insecure , intellectual , fretful nebbish , which he maintains is quite different from his real-life personality . In 2004 Comedy Central ranked Allen fourth on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians , while a UK survey ranked Allen the third-greatest comedian . By the mid-1960s Allen was writing and directing films , first specializing in slapstick comedies before moving into dramatic material influenced by European art cinema during the 1970s , and alternating between comedies and dramas to the present . He is often identified as part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmakers of the mid-1960s to late 1970s . Allen often stars in his films , typically in the persona he developed as a standup . Some of the best-known of his over 50 films are Annie Hall ( 1977 ) , Manhattan ( 1979 ) , Hannah and Her Sisters ( 1986 ) , Crimes and Misdemeanors ( 1989 ) , and Midnight in Paris ( 2011 ) . In 2007 he said Stardust Memories ( 1980 ) , The Purple Rose of Cairo ( 1985 ) , and Match Point ( 2005 ) were his best films . Critic Roger Ebert described Allen as a treasure of the cinema . Allen has received many accolades and honors . He has won four Academy Awards : three for Best Original Screenplay and one for Best Director .",

It was given an R rating in the United States for some violence , gore , strong adult content , and nudity . It is the second film in the so-called Karnstein Trilogy loosely based on the J. Sheridan Le Fanu novella Carmilla . It was preceded by The Vampire Lovers ( 1970 ) and followed by Twins of Evil ( 1971 ) . The three films do not form a chronological development , but use the Karnstein family as the source of the vampiric threat and were somewhat daring for the time in explicitly depicting lesbian themes . Production of Lust For a Vampire began not long after the release of The Vampire Lovers . The film has a cult following although some Hammer Horror fans have accused it of being overly camp and silly . Its most noted scene shows Yutte Stensgaard drenched in blood and partially covered by blood-soaked rags , although the filmed scene is not as explicit as that shown in a promotional still . Other notable actors in the film are Ralph Bates , Harvey Hall ( who has a different role in each film of this series ) , David Healy and popular radio DJ Mike Raven as Count Karnstein . Karnstein 's voice , however , is dubbed by an uncredited Valentine Dyall .",

The Vampire Woman , in the UK as Shadow of the Werewolf [ theatrical ] and as Werewolf Shadow [ dvd ] ) , is a 1970 Spanish horror film starring Paul Naschy , the fifth in a series about the werewolf Waldemar Daninsky . This film was directed by Le\u00f3n Klimovsky and written by Naschy , and is generally regarded to have kickstarted the Spanish horror film boom of the Seventies , due to its awesome box office success upon its release . The German distributors added the name Hans Munkel to the screenwriting credit in some versions to satisfy the terms of international co-production . Patty Shepard was so convincing as the vampiric Countess , it was thought at the time that she might replace actress Barbara Steele as Europe 's reigning horror queen . Klimovsky filmed many of the scenes in slow motion , to add to the otherworldliness of the film . Note* - There is a scene in this film that obviously inspired Spanish director Amando de Ossorio to write Tombs of the Blind Dead , which was made just a few months later in 1971 . A skeletal zombie in a monk 's garments assaults Naschy in a cemetery in one scene , bearing a strong resemblance to de Ossorio 's Templar Knights in his Blind Dead films .
