However , the railroad did not take full effect until September 30 , 1957 . The RFFSA linked 42 railways together ( both on documents and actual railroads ) , creating a regional system composed of 22 railroads . The goal of the RFFSA was to promote and advance the railroad sector of Brazil , creating a north-south-east-west rail network in all five regions of Brazil . But it failed and the RFFSA only served four of the five regions with a north-south rail network win 19 units of the federation of Brazil . By 1999 , the railroad was liquidated and privatized , with the last liquidations occurring in 2007 .",
  "/wiki/GE_U23C": "The 2300 horsepower GE U23C diesel-electric locomotive model was first offered by GE in 1968 , and featured a V-type 12 cylinder version of the standard GE FDL diesel motor . Designed as a competitor to EMD 's SD38 and SD39 series , it was intended for heavy transfer , drag and hump service where speed was not a priority . Other than six tall hood doors matching six power assemblies per side , there are very few features which distinguish the U23C from the U30C . The U30C has eight tall hood doors per side , a function of the V16 within . A total of 73 units were built at Erie including 20 for export to Brazil . An additional 150 units were built by GE de Brazil from 1972-1976 , some as kits supplied by GE .",

  "/wiki/4-6-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement , 4-6-0 represents the configuration of four leading wheels on two axles in a leading bogie , six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels . In the mid 19th century , this wheel arrangement became the second most popular configuration for new steam locomotives in the United States of America , where this type is commonly referred to as a Ten-wheeler . As a locomotive pulling trains of lightweight all wood passenger cars in the 1890-1920s , it was exceptionally stable at near 100 mph speeds on the New York Central 's New York to Chicago Water Level Route and on the Reading Railroad 's Camden to Atlantic City , NJ , line . As passenger equipment grew heavier with all steel construction , heavier locomotives replaced the Ten Wheeler .",

  "/wiki/EMD_G22": "The EMD G22 Locomotive Series made their debut in 1967 after the rise in popularity of the export EMD G12 . Designed to meet most First World , Second World and Third World countries , the G22 Series were now equipped with a naturally aspirated EMD 645 Series engine as well as four axle Flexicoil Type-B trucks which carry a low per-axle weight . Based on customer input , the G22 Series would be defined by various designations that suit the customer 's railway operations . The standard suffixes applied after the G22 designation were if the customer purchased locomotives with specific traction motors to fit Narrow Gauge ( U ) or Broad Gauge ( W ) rails . As the years progressed , the customers began to have more options available for their locomotives such as EMD Dash 2 Electronics , Alternators instead of Generators , A-1-A running gear and/or steam generators , etc . The G22 designation can freely apply to the designs of any EMD export model or a licensee of EMD as long as the electrical and mechanical gear were left unaltered .",
  "/wiki/ALCO_FA": "The ALCO FA was a family of B-B diesel locomotives designed to haul freight trains . The locomotives were built by a partnership of ALCO and General Electric in Schenectady , New York , between January 1946 and May 1959 . They were of a cab unit design , and both cab-equipped lead ( A unit ) FA and cabless booster ( B unit ) FB models were built . A dual passenger-freight version , the FPA/FPB , was also offered . It was equipped with a steam generator for heating passenger cars . Externally , the FA and FB models looked very similar to the ALCO PA models produced in the same period . Both the FA and PA models were styled by General Electric 's Ray Patten . They shared many of the same characteristics both aesthetically and mechanically . It was the locomotive 's mechanical qualities ( the ALCO 244 V-12 prime mover ) and newer locomotive models from both General Motors Electro-Motive Division ( EMD ) and General Electric ( the partnership with ALCO was dissolved in 1953 ) that ultimately led to the retirement of the FA/FB locomotive model from revenue service . Several examples of FAs and FBs have been preserved in railroad museums , a few of them in operational status on such lines as the Grand Canyon Railway and the Napa Valley Wine Train . ALCO 's designation of F marks these locomotives as being geared primarily for freight use , whereas the P designation of the PA sets indicates that they were geared for higher speeds and passenger use . However , beyond this their design was largely similar - aside from the PA/PB 's both being larger A1A-A1A types with an even more striking nose - and many railroads used FA and PA locomotives for both freight and passenger service .",
  "/wiki/GE_U20C": "The GE U20C diesel-electric locomotive was introduced by GE Transportation Systems as an export model road switcher in 1964 . It was powered by the 8-cylinder 7FDL-8 engine . This locomotive is used worldwide with many variations and modifications . Different engines may be used , e.g . 7FDL8 and 7FDL12 . Like the other members of the Universal series , and can be built to suit all track gauges ."
