  "/wiki/Nobel_prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded yearly by the Nobel Foundation for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine . One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal . The most recent Nobel prize was announced by Karolinska Institute on 7 October 2019 , and has been awarded to Americans William Kaelin Jr. , Gregg L. Semenza and British Peter J. Ratcliffe - for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability . Some awards have been controversial . This includes one to Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz in 1949 for the prefrontal lobotomy , bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment . Other controversies resulted from disagreements over who was included in the award .",

  "/wiki/Old_Testament": "The Old Testament ( abbreviated OT ) is the first part of the Christian biblical canon , which is based primarily upon the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible ( or Tanakh ) , a collection of ancient religious Hebrew writings by the Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God . The second part of Christian Bibles is the New Testament , originally written in the Koine Greek language . The books that comprise the Old Testament canon , as well as their order and names , differ between Christian denominations . The Catholic canon comprises 46 books , the canons of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches comprise up to 49 books , and the most common Protestant canon comprises 39 books . The 39 books in common to all the Christian canons correspond to the 24 books of the Tanakh , with some differences of order , and there are some differences in text . The additional number reflects the splitting of several texts ( Kings , Samuel and Chronicles , Ezra-Nehemiah and the Twelve Minor Prophets ) into separate books in Christian bibles . The books that are part of the Christian Old Testament but that are not part of the Hebrew canon are sometimes described as deuterocanonical . In general , Protestant Bibles do not include the deuterocanonical books in their canon , but some versions of Anglican and Lutheran bibles place such books in a separate section called Apocrypha . These extra books are ultimately derived from the earlier Greek Septuagint collection of the Hebrew scriptures and are also Jewish in origin . Some are also contained in the Dead Sea Scrolls . The Old Testament consists of many distinct books by various authors produced over a period of centuries . Christians traditionally divide the Old Testament into four sections : ( 1 ) the first five books or Pentateuch ( Torah ) ; ( 2 ) the history books telling the history of the Israelites , from their conquest of Canaan to their defeat and exile in Babylon ; ( 3 ) the poetic and Wisdom books dealing , in various forms , with questions of good and evil in the world ; and ( 4 ) the books of the biblical prophets , warning of the consequences of turning away from God .",
  "/wiki/Theology": "As defined by Scholasticism , theology is constituted by a triple aspect : what is taught by God , teaches of God and leads to God ( Latin : Theologia a Deo docetur , Deum docet , et ad Deum ducit ) . This indicates the three distinct areas of God as theophanic revelation , the systematic study of the nature of divine and , more generally , of religious belief , and the spiritual path . Theology is taught as an academic discipline , typically in universities and seminaries . It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural , but also deals with religious epistemology , asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation . Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God , gods , or deities , as not only transcendent or above the natural world , but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and , in particular , to reveal themselves to humankind . While theology has turned into a secular field , religious adherents still consider theology to be a discipline that helps them live and understand concepts such as life and love and that helps them lead lives of obedience to the deities they follow or worship .",

As a constructive theologian , Keller 's work is oriented around social and ecological justice , poststructuralist theory , and feminist readings of scripture and theology . Both her early and her late work brings relational thinking into theology , focusing on the relational nature of the concept of the divine , and the forms of ecological interdependence within the framework of relational theology . Her work in process theology draws on the relational ontology of Alfred North Whitehead , fielding it in a postmodern , deconstructive framework .",
  "/wiki/Process_theology": "Process theology is a type of theology developed from Alfred North Whitehead 's ( 1861-1947 ) process philosophy , most notably by Charles Hartshorne ( 1897-2000 ) and John B. Cobb ( b . 1925 ) . Process theology and process philosophy are collectively referred to as process thought . For both Whitehead and Hartshorne , it is an essential attribute of God to affect and be affected by temporal processes , contrary to the forms of theism that hold God to be in all respects non-temporal ( eternal ) , unchanging ( immutable ) , and unaffected by the world ( impassible ) . Process theology does not deny that God is in some respects eternal ( will never die ) , immutable ( in the sense that God is unchangingly good ) , and impassible ( in the sense that God 's eternal aspect is unaffected by actuality ) , but it contradicts the classical view by insisting that God is in some respects temporal , mutable , and passible . According to Cobb , process theology may refer to all forms of theology that emphasize event , occurrence , or becoming over substance . In this sense theology influenced by Hegel is process theology just as much as that influenced by Whitehead . This use of the term calls attention to affinities between these otherwise quite different traditions . Also Pierre Teilhard de Chardin can be included among process theologians , even if they are generally understood as referring to the Whiteheadian/Hartshornean school , where there continue to be ongoing debates within the field on the nature of God , the relationship of God and the world , and immortality .",

Callid Keefe-Perry , Rubem Alves , Catherine Keller , John Caputo , Peter Rollins , Scott Holland , Melanie May , Matt Guynn , Roland Faber , and others .",
  "/wiki/Constructive_theology": "Constructive theology is the redefinition or reconceptualization [ citation needed ] of what historically has been known as systematic theology . The reason for this reevaluation stems from the idea that , in systematic theology , the theologian attempts to develop a coherent theory running through the various doctrines within the tradition ( Christology , eschatology , pneumatology , etc. ) . A potential problem underlying such study is that in constructing a system of theology , certain elements may be forced into a presupposed structure , or left out altogether , in order to maintain the coherence of the overall system . In response to this realization , some modern theologians , especially Christian feminists such as Sallie McFague , Catherine Keller , and Sharon V. Betcher , feel that the term systematic is no longer accurate in reference to theology , and prefer the language of constructive theology . [ citation needed ] However , constructive theologians vary as to whether they reject the term systematic altogether , with the term systematic continuing to be preferred especially by Roman Catholics . While not a proponent of the language of constructive theology , Karl Barth frequently criticized the practice of systematizing theology or structuring a coherent system upon a philosophical foundation external to theology 's own internal commitments . The term constructive theology has been in use mostly since the 1980s . Constructive Theology is also the title of a journal on the subject . A Bloomsbury book series on constructive theology , titled Rethinking Theologies , Constructing Alternatives , is edited by Marion Grau , Susannah Cornwall , Steed Davidson , and Hyo-Dong Lee .",
  "/wiki/Baptist": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

  "/wiki/Atonement_in_Christianity": "Salvation in Christianity , also called deliverance , or redemption , is the saving [ of ] human beings from death and separation from God by Christ 's death and resurrection , [ note 1 ] and the justification following this salvation . While the idea of Jesus ' death as an atonement for human sin was derived from the Hebrew writings , and was elaborated in Paul 's epistles and in the Gospels , Paul saw the faithful redeemed by participation in Jesus ' death and rising . Early Christians regarded themselves as partaking in a new covenant with God , open to both Jews and gentiles , due to the sacrificial death and subsequent exaltation of Jesus Christ . Early Christian notions of the person and sacrificial role of Jesus in human salvation were further elaborated by the Church Fathers , medieval writers and modern scholars in various atonement theories , such as the ransom theory , Christus Victor theory , the recapitulation theory , the satisfaction theory , the penal substitution theory , and the moral influence theory . Variant views on salvation are among the main fault lines dividing the various Christian denominations , including conflicting definitions of sin and depravity ( the sinful nature of humankind ) , justification ( God 's means of removing the consequences of sin ) , and atonement ( the forgiving or pardoning of sin through the suffering , death and resurrection of Jesus ) .",

He founded Dialogue House in New York City to help promote this method . Progoff began exploring psychological methods for creativity and spiritual experience in their social applications in the early 1950s . His doctoral dissertation in the field of the social history of ideas at the New School was on the work of C.G . Jung . In 1953 , the dissertation was published in hardcover by the Julian Press as Jung 's Psychology and its Social Meaning . Later editions were published by the Grove Press , Anchor/Doubleday , and Dialogue House . After receiving his doctorate , Progoff was awarded a Bollingen fellowship , and studied privately with Jung in Switzerland . This work led to a reconstruction of depth psychology in terms of the later work of Freud , Adler , Jung , and Rank in The Death and Rebirth of Psychology and a first statement of Holistic Depth Psychology in Depth Psychology and Modern Man . In 1963 , Progoff put forward the method of Psyche-Evoking in The Symbolic and the Real .
