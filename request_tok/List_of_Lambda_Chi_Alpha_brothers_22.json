Adkins is remembered as a skilled retail politician and a strong states ' rights proponent and social conservative who served as governor during a period when Arkansas departed from several national economic and societal trends . The Adkins administration fought federal influence in Arkansas during the post-New Deal era ; successfully courting federal wartime production investment during World War II while battling the federal resettlement of Japanese-Americans in the state and Supreme Court civil rights decisions . The Adkins administration was in several ways a forerunner to years of segregationist governors in Arkansas and across the South , most famously Alabama Governor George Wallace . The former Ku Klux Klan member fought the post-World War II civil rights gains made by African-Americans and sought to organize a constitutional convention to restore the white primary after the Supreme Court 's Smith vs. Allwright decision . Derided as Holy Homer by opponents , Adkins ' strong brand of social conservativism earned formidable opposition from moderates and more progressive politicians like preceding governor-turned rival Carl E. Bailey , as well as the pro-gambling interests in the resort town Hot Springs . After leaving office , Adkins remained an influential voice in state politics , assisting later governors Sid McMath and Orval Faubus .",
