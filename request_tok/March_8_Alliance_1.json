Greek Orthodox Christianity has also traditionally placed heavy emphasis and awarded high prestige to traditions of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and asceticism , with origins in Early Christianity in the Near East and in Byzantine Anatolia . Historically , the term Greek Orthodox has also been used to describe all Eastern Orthodox Churches in general , since Greek in Greek Orthodox can refer to the heritage of the Byzantine Empire . During the first eight centuries of Christian history , most major intellectual , cultural , and social developments in the Christian Church took place within the Empire or in the sphere of its influence , where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings . Over time , most parts of the liturgy , traditions , and practices of the church of Constantinople were adopted by all , and still provide the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy . Thus , the Eastern Church came to be called Greek Orthodox in the same way that the Western Church is called Roman Catholic . However , the appellation Greek was abandoned by the Slavic and other Eastern Orthodox churches in connection with their peoples ' national awakenings , from as early as the 10th century A.D . Thus , today it is generally only those churches that are most closely tied to Greek or Byzantine culture that are called Greek Orthodox .",

It is headed by Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi since 2011 , seated in Bkerke north of Beirut , Lebanon . Officially known as the Syriac Maronite Church of Antioch , it is part of Syriac Christianity by liturgy and heritage . Establishment of the Maronite Church can be divided into three periods , from the 4th to the 7th centuries . A congregation movement , with Saint Maroun from the Taurus Mountains as an inspirational leader and patron saint , marked the first period . The second began with the establishment of the Monastery of Saint Maroun on the Orontes , built after the Council of Chalcedon to defend the doctrines of the Council . This monastery was described as the greatest monastery in the region of Secunda Syria , with more than 300 hermitages around it , according to ancient records . After 518 , the monastery de facto administered many parishes in Prima Syria , Cole Syria and Phoenicia . The third period was when Sede Vacante followed the Islamic conquest of the region and bishops of the Saint Maroun Monastery elected John Maron as Patriarch around 685 AD , according to the Maronite tradition . The Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch re-established their patriarchate in 751 AD . Other centers of historical importance include Kfarhay , Yanouh , Mayfouq and Qadisha Valley . Although reduced in numbers today , Maronites remain one of the principal ethno-religious groups in Lebanon , with smaller minorities of Maronites in Syria , Cyprus , Israel , and Jordan .",

  "/wiki/Druze": "The Druze are an Arabic-speaking esoteric ethno-religious group originating in Western Asia who self-identify as Al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id\u016bn ( lit. , The People of Monotheism ) . Jethro of Midian is considered an ancestor of Druze , who revere him as their spiritual founder and chief prophet . It is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the teachings of Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and the sixth Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah , and Greek philosophers such as Plato , Aristotle , Pythagoras , and Zeno of Citium . The Epistles of Wisdom is the foundational text of the Druze faith . The Druze faith incorporates elements of Isma'ilism , a branch of Shia Islam , Gnosticism , Hinduism , Neoplatonism , Pythagoreanism , and other philosophies and beliefs , creating a distinct and secretive theology , based on an esoteric interpretation of scripture , which emphasises the role of the mind and truthfulness . Druze believe in theophany and reincarnation , or the transmigration of the soul . Druze believe that at the end of the cycle of rebirth , which is achieved through successive reincarnations , the soul is united with the Cosmic Mind ( al-\u02bfAql al-kull\u012b ) . Although dwarfed by other , larger communities , the Druze community played an important role in shaping the history of the Levant , where it continues to play a large political role . As a religious minority in every country in which they are found , they have frequently experienced persecution , except in Lebanon and Israel , where Druze judges , parliamentarians , diplomats , and doctors occupy the highest echelons of society . Even though the faith originally developed out of Ismaili Islam , Druze are not generally considered Muslims , although Al Azhar of Egypt recognizes them as one of the Islamic sects , akin to Shia . Fatimid caliph Ali az-Zahir , whose father al-Hakim is a key figure in the Druze faith , was particularly harsh to Druze , causing the death of many in Antioch , Aleppo , and northern Syria . Persecution flared up during the rule of the Mamluks and Ottomans .",

Today the party operates in Armenia , Artsakh and in countries where the Armenian diaspora is present . Nowadays it constitutes a minor party , and as of December 2018 was represented in two national parliaments with 7 seats in the National Assembly of Artsakh and three seats in the Parliament of Lebanon as part of the March 8 Alliance . The ARF has traditionally advocated democratic socialism and is a full member of the Socialist International since 2003 , which it had originally joined in 1907 . It has the largest membership of the political parties present in the Armenian diaspora , having established affiliates in more than 20 countries . Compared to other Armenian parties which tend to primarily focus on educational or humanitarian projects , the ARF is the most politically oriented of the organizations and traditionally has been one of the staunchest supporters of Armenian nationalism . The party campaigns for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and the right to reparations . It also advocates the establishment of United Armenia , partially based on the Treaty of S\u00e8vres of 1920 . The ARF became active within the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending Armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the Armenian-populated areas of the empire . ARF members formed fedayi groups that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance . The Dashnaks aspired towards the wider goal of creating a free , independent and unified Armenia , although they nearly always set aside this goal in favor of a more realistic approach , such as advocating autonomy . In 1918 , the party was instrumental in the creation of the First Republic of Armenia , which fell to the Soviet communists in 1920 .",

  "/wiki/Sunni": "Sunni Islam ( /\u02c8su\u02d0ni , \u02c8s\u028ani/ ) is the largest denomination of Islam , followed by 87-90% of the world 's Muslims . Its name comes from the word sunnah , referring to the behaviour of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and subsequently acquired broader political significance , as well as theological and juridical dimensions . According to Sunni traditions , Muhammad did not clearly designate a successor and the Muslim community acted according to his sunnah in electing his father-in-law Abu Bakr as the first caliph . This contrasts with the Shia view , which holds that Muhammad announced his son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor , most notably at Ghadir Khumm . Political tensions between Sunnis and Shias continued with varying intensity throughout Islamic history and have been exacerbated in recent times by ethnic conflicts and the rise of Wahhabism . The adherents of Sunni Islam are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jam\u0101\u02bbah ( the people of the sunnah and the community ) or ahl as-sunnah for short . In English , its doctrines and practices are sometimes called Sunnism , while adherents are known as Sunni Muslims , Sunnis , Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah . Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as orthodox Islam , though some scholars view this translation as inappropriate . The Quran , together with hadith ( especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah ) and binding juristic consensus , form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam . Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources , in conjunction with analogical reasoning , consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion , using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools . In matters of creed , the Sunni tradition upholds the six pillars of iman ( faith ) and comprises the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools of rationalistic theology as well as the textualist school known as traditionalist theology .",

  "/wiki/Shia": "Shia Islam or Shi'ism is one of the two main branches of Islam . It holds that the Islamic prophet Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor and the Imam ( leader ) after him , most notably at the event of Ghadir Khumm , but was prevented from the caliphate as a result of the incident of Saqifah . This view primarily contrasts with that of Sunni Islam , whose adherents believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor and consider Abu Bakr , who was appointed caliph by a small group of Muslims at Saqifah , to be the first rightful caliph after the Prophet . Unlike the first three Rashidun caliphs , Ali was from the same clan as Muhammad , Banu Hashim , as well as being the prophet 's cousin and being the first male to become Muslim . Shia Islam is the second largest branch of Islam : as of the late 2000s , Shia Muslims constituted 10-15% of all Muslims . Twelver Shia is the largest branch of Shia Islam , with 2012 estimates saying that 85% of Shias were Twelvers . Shia Islam is based on the prophet 's hadith ( Ghadir Khumm ) . Shia consider Ali to have been divinely appointed as the successor to Muhammad , and as the first Imam . The Shia also extend this Imammah to Muhammad 's family , the Ahl al-Bayt ( the people/family of the House ) , and some individuals among his descendants , known as Imams , who they believe possess special spiritual and political authority over the community , infallibility and other divinely ordained traits . Although there are many Shia subsects , modern Shia Islam has been divided into two main groupings : Twelvers and Ismailis , with Twelver Shia being the largest and most influential group among Shia .",
