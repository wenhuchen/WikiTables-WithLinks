The 6 ' 2 marble obelisk marks a mass grave of Confederate casualties from the campaign , their names lost to history for 143 years . The inscription on the memorial has been damaged by acid rain and farming . Much of it is illegible today . The inscription reads Here off duty until the last reveille , lie the southern soldiers , in numbers who were slain in this country during the war of the succession . They fell among strangers , unknown and unfriended . Yet not unhonored ; for strangers hands have gathered their ashes here , and placed the shaft above them , that constancy and valor , though displayed in a fruitless enterprise , may not be unremembered .",
