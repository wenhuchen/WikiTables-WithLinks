  "/wiki/2018_Asian_Games": "The 2018 Asian Games ( Indonesian : Pesta Olahraga Asia 2018 , [ citation needed ] Asian Games 2018 ) , officially known as the 18th Asian Games and also known as Jakarta-Palembang 2018 , was a pan-Asian multi-sport event held from 18 August to 2 September 2018 in the Indonesian cities of Jakarta and Palembang . The Olympic Council of Asia ( OCA ) originally awarded the games to Hanoi , Vietnam in November 2012 , but the hosting rights were given up seventeen months later . Indonesia , which originally finished second in the bid , was considered as the strongest replacement candidate and eventually awarded the rights amid the 2014 games . Surabaya , the city put forward during the bid , was replaced by Jakarta and Palembang , having hosted the 2011 Southeast Asian Games together . For the first time , the Summer Asian Games were co-hosted by two cities ; the Indonesian capital of Jakarta ( which was hosting the Games for the first time since 1962 ) , and Palembang , the capital of the South Sumatra province . Events were held in and around the two cities , including venues in Bandung and the provinces of West Java and Banten . The opening and closing ceremonies of the Games were held at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta . Several non-Olympic events were trimmed from the event programme , but several new disciplines being introduced at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo ( including 3-on-3 basketball ) were added . eSports and canoe polo were also contested as demonstration sports . China led the medal tally for the tenth consecutive time . North and South Korea fielded a unified team during the opening ceremony and selected events , and also won their first-ever gold medal as a unified team at a multi-sport event . 6 world , 18 Asian and 86 Asian Games records were broken during the Games , while Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee was announced as the most valuable player .",
