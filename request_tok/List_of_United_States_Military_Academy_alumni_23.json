Major general ranks above brigadier general and below lieutenant general . [ Note 1 ] A major general typically commands division-sized units of 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers . Major general is equivalent to the two-star rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard , and is the highest permanent peacetime rank in the uniformed services .

  "/wiki/Mexican\u2013American_War": "The Mexican-American War , [ a ] also known in the United States as the Mexican War and in Mexico as the Intervenci\u00f3n Estadounidense en M\u00e9xico ( American intervention in Mexico ) , [ b ] was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848 . It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas , which was not formally recognized by the Mexican government , who disputed the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican caudillo President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after the Texas Revolution a decade earlier . In 1845 , newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk , who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a further expansion of the United States , sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico . After Mexican forces attacked U.S. forces , the United States Congress declared war . U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of Alta California , and then moved south . Meanwhile , the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in the lower Baja California Territory . The U.S. Army , under Major General Winfield Scott , eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance , having marched west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast , where the U.S. staged its first ever major amphibious landing . The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , forced onto the remnant Mexican government , ended the war and enforced the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States . The U.S. agreed to pay $ 15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $ 3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens . Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the State of Texas and accepted the Rio Grande as its northern border with the United States . The victory and territorial expansion Polk envisioned inspired great patriotism in the United States , but the war and treaty drew some criticism in the U.S. for their casualties , monetary cost , and heavy-handedness , particularly early on . The question of how to treat the new acquisitions also intensified the debate over slavery .",

Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia and Union General George B. McClellan 's Army of the Potomac , near Sharpsburg , Maryland and Antietam Creek . Part of the Maryland Campaign , it was the first field army-level engagement in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War to take place on Union soil . It was the bloodiest day in United States military history , with a combined tally of 22,717 dead , wounded , or missing . After pursuing the Confederate general Robert E. Lee into Maryland , Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan of the Union Army launched attacks against Lee 's army , in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek . At dawn on September 17 , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee 's left flank . Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller 's Cornfield , and fighting swirled around the Dunker Church . Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center , but the Federal advantage was not followed up . In the afternoon , Union Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside 's corps entered the action , capturing a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and advancing against the Confederate right . At a crucial moment , Confederate Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill 's division arrived from Harpers Ferry and launched a surprise counterattack , driving back Burnside and ending the battle . Although outnumbered two-to-one , Lee committed his entire force , while McClellan sent in less than three-quarters of his army , enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill . During the night , both armies consolidated their lines . In spite of crippling casualties , Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout September 18 , while removing his battered army south of the Potomac River .",

He was severely wounded while leading his brigade at the Battle of Glendale . As a division commander , he had notable success at the Battle of South Mountain and assumed temporary corps command at the Battle of Antietam . Meade 's division was arguably the most successful of any at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December . It was part of a force charged with driving the Confederate troops under Stonewall Jackson back from their position on Prospect Hill . The division made it further than any other , but was forced to turn back due to a lack of reinforcements . Meade was promoted to commander of the V Corps , which he led during the Battle of Chancellorsville .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Fredericksburg": "The Battle of Fredericksburg was fought December 11-15 , 1862 , in and around Fredericksburg , Virginia , in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War . The combat , between the Union Army of the Potomac commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee , was part of the Union Army 's futile frontal attacks on December 13 against entrenched Confederate defenders on the heights behind the city . It is remembered as one of the most one-sided battles of the war , with Union casualties more than twice as heavy as those suffered by the Confederates . A visitor to the battlefield described the battle to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as a butchery . Burnside 's plan was to cross the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg in mid-November and race to the Confederate capital of Richmond before Lee 's army could stop him . Bureaucratic delays prevented Burnside from receiving the necessary pontoon bridges in time and Lee moved his army to block the crossings . When the Union army was finally able to build its bridges and cross under fire , direct combat within the city resulted on December 11-12 . Union troops prepared to assault Confederate defensive positions south of the city and on a strongly fortified ridge just west of the city known as Marye 's Heights . On December 13 , the Left Grand Division of Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin was able to pierce the first defensive line of Confederate Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson to the south , but was finally repulsed . Burnside ordered the Right and Center Grand Divisions of Maj. Gens . Edwin V.

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Chancellorsville": "The Battle of Chancellorsville was a major battle of the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , and the principal engagement of the Chancellorsville campaign . It was fought from April 30 to May 6 , 1863 , in Spotsylvania County , Virginia , near the village of Chancellorsville . Two related battles were fought nearby on May 3 in the vicinity of Fredericksburg . The campaign pitted Union Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size , General Robert E. Lee 's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia . Chancellorsville is known as Lee 's perfect battle because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory . The victory , a product of Lee 's audacity and Hooker 's timid decision-making , was tempered by heavy casualties , including Lt. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson . Jackson was hit by friendly fire , requiring his left arm to be amputated . He died of pneumonia eight days later , a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm . Lee 's difficulty in replacing his lost men as well as his inability to prevent the Union withdrawal effectively have led to his great victory being regarded as a Pyrrhic one . The Chancellorsville campaign began with the crossing of the Rappahannock River by the Union army on the morning of April 27 , 1863 . Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman began a long-distance raid against Lee 's supply lines at about the same time . This operation was completely ineffectual .",

Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia to forces of the Union Army ( Army of the Potomac , Army of the James and Army of the Shenandoah ) under the overall command of Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant , marking the effective end of the war . As the Richmond-Petersburg campaign ( also known as the siege of Petersburg ) ended , Lee 's army was outnumbered and exhausted from a winter of trench warfare over an approximately 40 mi ( 64 km ) front , [ notes 1 ] numerous battles , disease , hunger and desertion . Grant 's well-equipped and well-fed army was growing in strength . On March 29 , 1865 , the Union Army began an offensive that stretched and broke the Confederate defenses southwest of Petersburg and cut their supply lines to Petersburg and the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia . Union victories at the Battle of Five Forks on April 1 , 1865 and the Third Battle of Petersburg , often called the Breakthrough at Petersburg , on April 2 , 1865 , opened Petersburg and Richmond to imminent capture . Lee ordered the evacuation of Confederate forces from both Petersburg and Richmond on the night of April 2-3 before Grant 's army could cut off any escape . Confederate government leaders also fled west from Richmond that night . The Confederates marched west , heading toward Danville , Virginia or Lynchburg , Virginia as an alternative . Lee planned to resupply his army at one of those cities and march southwest into North Carolina where he could unite his army with the Confederate army commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston . Grant 's Union Army pursued Lee 's fleeing Confederates relentlessly . During the next week , the Union troops fought a series of battles with Confederate units , cut off or destroyed Confederate supplies and blocked their paths to the south and ultimately to the west .

A son of Revolutionary War officer Henry Light Horse Harry Lee III , Lee was a top graduate of the United States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer in the United States Army for 32 years . During this time , he served throughout the United States , distinguished himself during the Mexican-American War , and served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy . He was also the husband of Mary Anna Custis Lee , adopted great granddaughter of George Washington . When Virginia 's 1861 Richmond Convention declared secession from the Union , Lee chose to follow his home state , despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command . During the first year of the Civil War , he served as a senior military adviser to Confederate President Jefferson Davis . Once he took command of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862 , he soon emerged as an able tactician and battlefield commander , winning most of his battles , nearly all against far larger Union armies . Lee 's two major strategic offensives into Union territory ended in defeat . His aggressive tactics , especially at the Battle of Gettysburg , which resulted in high casualties at a time when the Confederacy had a shortage of manpower , have come under criticism in recent years . Lee surrendered the remnant of his army to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 .

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south .

The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline .

In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

  "/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman": "William Tecumseh Sherman ( February 8 , 1820 - February 14 , 1891 ) was an American soldier , businessman , educator , and author . He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War ( 1861-65 ) , receiving recognition for his command of military strategy as well as criticism for the harshness of the scorched earth policies he implemented in conducting total war against the Confederate States . British military theorist and historian B. H. Liddell Hart declared that Sherman was the first modern general . Born in Ohio to a politically prominent family , Sherman graduated in 1840 from the United States Military Academy at West Point . He interrupted his military career in 1853 to pursue private business ventures , and at the outbreak of the Civil War he was superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy ( now Louisiana State University ) . Sherman distinguished himself at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861 , before being transferred to the Western Theater . Stationed in Kentucky , his pessimism about the outlook of the war led to a nervous breakdown that required him to be briefly put on leave . He recovered by forging a close partnership with General Ulysses S. Grant . Sherman served under Grant in 1862 and 1863 during the battles of forts Henry and Donelson , the Battle of Shiloh , the campaigns that led to the fall of the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River , as well as the Chattanooga Campaign that culminated with the routing of the Confederate armies in the state of Tennessee . In 1864 , Sherman succeeded Grant as the Union commander in the western theater of the war . Sherman then led the capture of the strategic city of Atlanta , a military success that contributed to the re-election of President Abraham Lincoln . Sherman 's subsequent march through Georgia and the Carolinas involved little fighting but large-scale destruction of cotton plantations and other infrastructure , a systematic policy intended to undermine the ability and willingness of the Confederacy to continue fighting for its independence .",

Grant ) had moved via the Tennessee River deep into Tennessee and was encamped principally at Pittsburg Landing on the west bank of the Tennessee River , where the Confederate Army of Mississippi ( General Albert Sidney Johnston , P. G. T. Beauregard second-in-command ) launched a surprise attack on Grant 's army from its base in Corinth , Mississippi . Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting ; Beauregard took command of the army and decided against pressing the attack late in the evening . Overnight , Grant was reinforced by one of his divisions stationed further north and was joined by three divisions from the Army of the Ohio ( Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell ) . The Union forces began an unexpected counterattack the next morning which reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day . On April 6 , the first day of the battle , the Confederates struck with the intention of driving the Union defenders away from the river and into the swamps of Owl Creek to the west . Johnston hoped to defeat Grant 's army before the anticipated arrival of Buell and the Army of the Ohio . The Confederate battle lines became confused during the fighting , and Grant 's men instead fell back to the northeast , in the direction of Pittsburg Landing .

The campaign consisted of many important naval operations , troop maneuvers , failed initiatives , and eleven distinct battles from December 26 , 1862 , to July 4 , 1863 . Military historians divide the campaign into two formal phases : operations against Vicksburg ( December 1862 - January 1863 ) and Grant 's operations against Vicksburg ( March-July 1863 ) . Grant initially planned a two-pronged approach in which half of his army , under Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman , would advance to the Yazoo River and attempt to reach Vicksburg from the northeast , while Grant took the remainder of the army down the Mississippi Central Railroad . Both of these initiatives failed . Grant conducted a number of experiments or expeditions - Grant 's bayou operations - that attempted to enable waterborne access to the Mississippi south of Vicksburg 's artillery batteries . All five of these initiatives failed as well . Finally , Union gunboats and troop transport boats ran the batteries at Vicksburg and met up with Grant 's men who had marched overland in Louisiana . On April 29 and April 30 , 1863 , Grant 's army crossed the Mississippi and landed at Bruinsburg , Mississippi . An elaborate series of demonstrations and diversions fooled the Confederates and the landings occurred without opposition .

During the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , the title was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army . In 1783 , the title was simplified to Senior Officer of the United States Army . In 1821 , the title was changed to Commanding General of the United States Army . The office was often referred to by various other titles , such as Major General Commanding the Army or General-in-Chief . From 1789 until its abolition in 1903 , the position of Commanding General was legally subordinate to the Secretary of War . The position was abolished with the creation of the statutory Chief of Staff of the Army in 1903 .",

Before his presidency , Grant led the Union Army as Commanding General of the United States Army in winning the American Civil War . As president , Grant worked with the Radical Republicans in the Reconstruction of the Union while having to deal with corruption in his administration . Raised in Ohio , young Grant possessed an exceptional ability with horses , which served him well through his military career . He was admitted to West Point and graduated from the U.S. military academy in 1843 . Grant served with distinction in the Mexican-American War . In 1848 , he married Julia Dent , and together they had four children . Grant abruptly resigned his army commission in 1854 and returned to his family , but lived in poverty for seven years . During the Civil War , he joined the Union Army in 1861 , and led the Vicksburg campaign , which gained control of the Mississippi River in 1863 . After Grant 's victory at Chattanooga , President Abraham Lincoln promoted Grant to Lieutenant General . For thirteen months , Grant fought Robert E. Lee during the high casualty Overland Campaign and at Petersburg . On April 9 , 1865 , Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox .",
  "/wiki/General_of_the_Army_(United_States)": "General of the Army ( abbreviated as GA ) is a five-star general officer and the second highest possible rank in the United States Army . A General of the Army ranks immediately above a general and is equivalent to a fleet admiral and a General of the Air Force . The General of the Army insignia consisted of five 3/8th inch stars in a pentagonal pattern , with points touching . The insignia was paired with the gold and enameled United States Coat of Arms on service coat shoulder loops . The silver colored five-star metal insignia alone would be worn for use as a collar insignia of grade and on the garrison cap . Soft shoulder epaulettes with five 7/16th inch stars in silver thread and gold-threaded United States Coat of Arms on green cloth were worn with shirts and sweaters . The rank of General of the Army has had two incarnations . The rank was introduced in 1866 , the year after the American Civil War . It was reserved for the Commanding General of the United States Army , was a four-star rank , and was held by three different individuals from 1866 to 1888 . The rank was revived as the modern five-star rank during World War II , and may be awarded to more than one serving officer at a time . It was held by five different individuals from 1944 to 1981 .

  "/wiki/Siege_of_Vicksburg": "The siege of Vicksburg ( May 18 - July 4 , 1863 ) was the final major military action in the Vicksburg campaign of the American Civil War . In a series of maneuvers , Union Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Tennessee crossed the Mississippi River and drove the Confederate Army of Mississippi , led by Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton , into the defensive lines surrounding the fortress city of Vicksburg , Mississippi . Vicksburg was the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River ; therefore , capturing it completed the second part of the Northern strategy , the Anaconda Plan . When two major assaults against the Confederate fortifications , on May 19 and 22 , were repulsed with heavy casualties , Grant decided to besiege the city beginning on May 25 . After holding out for more than forty days , with their supplies nearly gone , the garrison surrendered on July 4 . The successful ending of the Vicksburg campaign significantly degraded the ability of the Confederacy to maintain its war effort . This action , combined with the surrender of Port Hudson to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9 , yielded command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces , who would hold it for the rest of the conflict . The Confederate surrender on July 4 , 1863 , is sometimes considered , when combined with Gen. Robert E. Lee 's defeat at Gettysburg by Maj. Gen. George Meade the previous day , the turning point of the war . It cut off the Trans-Mississippi Department ( containing the states of Arkansas , Texas and part of Louisiana ) from the rest of the Confederate States , effectively splitting the Confederacy in two for the duration of the war .",
  "/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg": "The Richmond-Petersburg campaign was a series of battles around Petersburg , Virginia , fought from June 15 , 1864 , to April 2 , 1865 , during the American Civil War . Although it is more popularly known as the siege of Petersburg , it was not a classic military siege , in which a city is usually surrounded and all supply lines are cut off , nor was it strictly limited to actions against Petersburg . The campaign consisted of nine months of trench warfare in which Union forces commanded by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assaulted Petersburg unsuccessfully and then constructed trench lines that eventually extended over 30 miles ( 48 km ) from the eastern outskirts of Richmond , Virginia , to around the eastern and southern outskirts of Petersburg . Petersburg was crucial to the supply of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's army and the Confederate capital of Richmond . Numerous raids were conducted and battles fought in attempts to cut off the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad . Many of these battles caused the lengthening of the trench lines . Lee finally gave in to the pressure and abandoned both cities in April 1865 , leading to his retreat and surrender at Appomattox Court House . The Siege of Petersburg foreshadowed the trench warfare that was common in World War I , earning it a prominent position in military history . It also featured the war 's largest concentration of African-American troops , who suffered heavy casualties at such engagements as the Battle of the Crater and Chaffin 's Farm .",

Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War . Both armies suffered heavy casualties , around 5,000 men killed in total , a harbinger of a bloody war of attrition by Grant against Lee 's army and , eventually , the Confederate capital , Richmond , Virginia . The battle was tactically inconclusive , as Grant disengaged and continued his offensive . Grant attempted to move quickly through the dense underbrush of the Wilderness of Spotsylvania , but Lee launched two of his corps on parallel roads to intercept him . On the morning of May 5 , the Union V Corps under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren attacked the Confederate Second Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell , on the Orange Turnpike . That afternoon the Third Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill , encountered Brig . Gen. George W. Getty 's division ( VI Corps ) and Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock 's II Corps on the Orange Plank Road . Fighting until dark was fierce but inconclusive as both sides attempted to maneuver in the dense woods . At dawn on May 6 , Hancock attacked along the Plank Road , driving Hill 's Corps back in confusion , but the First Corps of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet arrived in time to prevent the collapse of the Confederate right flank . Longstreet followed up with a surprise flanking attack from an unfinished railroad bed that drove Hancock 's men back to the Brock Road , but the momentum was lost when Longstreet was wounded by his own men .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Spotsylvania_Court_House": "The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House , sometimes more simply referred to as the Battle of Spotsylvania ( or the 19th-century spelling Spottsylvania ) , was the second major battle in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant 's 1864 Overland Campaign of the American Civil War . Following the bloody but inconclusive Battle of the Wilderness , Grant 's army disengaged from Confederate General Robert E. Lee 's army and moved to the southeast , attempting to lure Lee into battle under more favorable conditions . Elements of Lee 's army beat the Union army to the critical crossroads of Spotsylvania Court House , Virginia , and began entrenching . Fighting occurred on and off from May 8 through May 21 , 1864 , as Grant tried various schemes to break the Confederate line . In the end , the battle was tactically inconclusive , but both sides declared victory . The Confederacy declared victory because they were able to hold their defenses . The United States declared victory because the Federal offensive continued and Lee 's army suffered losses that could not be replaced . With almost 32,000 casualties on both sides , Spotsylvania was the costliest battle of the campaign . On May 8 , Union Maj. Gens . Gouverneur K. Warren and John Sedgwick unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge the Confederates under Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson from Laurel Hill , a position that was blocking them from Spotsylvania Court House . On May 10 , Grant ordered attacks across the Confederate line of earthworks , which by now extended over 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) , including a prominent salient known as the Mule Shoe .

  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",
  "/wiki/George_B._McClellan": "George Brinton McClellan ( December 3 , 1826 - October 29 , 1885 ) was an American soldier , civil engineer , railroad executive , and politician . A graduate of West Point , McClellan served with distinction during the Mexican-American War ( 1846-1848 ) , and later left the Army to work in railroads until the outbreak of the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) . Early in the conflict , McClellan was appointed to the rank of major general and played an important role in raising a well-trained and organized army , which would become the Army of the Potomac in the Eastern Theater ; he served a brief period ( November 1861 to March 1862 ) as general-in-chief of the Union Army . McClellan organized and led the Union army in the Peninsula Campaign in southeastern Virginia from March through July 1862 . It was the first large-scale offensive in the Eastern Theater . Making an amphibious clockwise turning movement around the Confederate Army in northern Virginia , McClellan 's forces turned west to move up the Virginia Peninsula , between the James and York Rivers , landing from the Chesapeake Bay , with the Confederate capital , Richmond , as their objective . Initially , McClellan was somewhat successful against General Joseph E. Johnston , but the emergence of General Robert E. Lee to command the Army of Northern Virginia turned the subsequent Seven Days Battles into a partial Union defeat . However , historians note that Lee 's victory was in many ways pyrrhic as he failed to destroy the Army of the Potomac and suffered a bloody repulse at Malvern Hill . General McClellan and President Abraham Lincoln developed a mutual distrust , and McClellan was privately derisive of his commander-in-chief . McClellan was removed from command in November in the aftermath of the 1862 midterm elections . This decision contributed to McClellan 's failure to decisively pursue Lee 's Army following the tactically inconclusive but strategic Union victory at the Battle of Antietam outside Sharpsburg , Maryland . McClellan never received another field command and went on to become the unsuccessful Democratic Party nominee in the 1864 presidential election against the Republican Lincoln 's reelection .",

The battle was fought on July 21 , 1861 in Prince William County , Virginia , just north of the city of Manassas and about 25 miles west-southwest of Washington , D.C . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy . Yielding to political pressure , Brig . Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig . Gen. P. G. T.

Just before the siege preparations were completed , the Confederates , now under the direct command of Johnston , began a withdrawal toward Richmond . The first heavy fighting of the campaign occurred in the Battle of Williamsburg , in which the Union troops managed some tactical victories , but the Confederates continued their withdrawal . An amphibious flanking movement to Eltham 's Landing was ineffective in cutting off the Confederate retreat . In the Battle of Drewry 's Bluff , an attempt by the U.S. Navy to reach Richmond by way of the James River was repulsed .

It inflicted proportionately higher losses on Lee 's army and maneuvered it into a siege at Richmond and Petersburg , Virginia , in just over eight weeks . Crossing the Rapidan River on May 4 , 1864 , Grant sought to defeat Lee 's army by quickly placing his forces between Lee and Richmond and inviting an open battle . Lee surprised Grant by attacking the larger Union army aggressively in the Battle of the Wilderness ( May 5-7 ) , resulting in heavy casualties on both sides . Unlike his predecessors in the Eastern Theater , however , Grant did not withdraw his army following this setback , but instead maneuvered to the southeast , resuming his attempt to interpose his forces between Lee and Richmond . Lee 's army was able to get into position to block this movement . At the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House ( May 8-21 ) , Grant repeatedly attacked segments of the Confederate defensive line , hoping for a breakthrough , but the only results were again heavy losses for both sides . Grant maneuvered again , meeting Lee at the North Anna River ( Battle of North Anna , May 23-26 ) . Here , Lee held clever defensive positions that provided an opportunity to defeat portions of Grant 's army , but illness prevented Lee from attacking in time to trap Grant .

The valley is bounded to the east by the Blue Ridge Mountains , to the west by the eastern front of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians ( excluding Massanutten Mountain ) , to the north by the Potomac River and to the south by the James River . The cultural region covers a larger area that includes all of the valley plus the Virginia highlands to the west , and the Roanoke Valley to the south . It is physiographically located within the Ridge and Valley province and is a portion of the Great Appalachian Valley .",
  "/wiki/American_Indian_Wars": "The American Indian Wars ( also known as the Indian Wars or the First Nations Wars ; French : Guerres des Premi\u00e8res Nations ) is the collective name for the various armed conflicts that were fought by European governments and colonists , and later by the governments and settlers , against various American Indian and First Nation tribes . These conflicts occurred in North America from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the early 20th century . The various wars resulted from a wide variety of factors , including cultural clashes , land disputes , and criminal acts committed by both sides . The European powers and their colonies also enlisted Indian tribes to help them conduct warfare against each other 's colonial settlements . After the American Revolution , many conflicts were local to specific states or regions and frequently involved disputes over land use ; some entailed cycles of violent reprisal . In Canada , 11 Numbered Treaties covering most of the First Nations lands limited the number of such conflicts . As settlers spread westward across America and Canada after 1780 , armed conflicts increased in size , duration , and intensity between settlers and various Indian and First Nation tribes . The climax came in the War of 1812 , when major Indian coalitions in the Midwest and the South fought against the United States and lost . Conflict with settlers became much less common and was usually resolved by treaty , often through sale or exchange of territory between the federal government and specific tribes . The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the American government to enforce the Indian removal from east of the Mississippi River to the west on the American frontier , especially Oklahoma . The federal policy of removal was eventually refined in the West , as American settlers kept expanding their territories , to relocate Indian tribes to specially designated and federally protected and subsidized reservations .",
  "/wiki/Robert_O._Tyler": "Robert Ogden Tyler ( December 31 , 1831 - December 1 , 1874 ) was an American soldier who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War . He was commander of the Artillery Reserve of the Army of the Potomac at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 , where his artillery batteries played an important role in the Union victory . Tyler also led a division of heavy artillery turned infantry during the Overland Campaign of 1864 . He was severely wounded at the Battle of Cold Harbor and relegated to administrative duties for the duration of the war .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Cold_Harbor": "The Battle of Cold Harbor was fought during the American Civil War near Mechanicsville , Virginia , from May 31 to June 12 , 1864 , with the most significant fighting occurring on June 3 . It was one of the final battles of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant 's Overland Campaign , and is remembered as one of American history 's bloodiest , most lopsided battles . Thousands of Union soldiers were killed or wounded in a hopeless frontal assault against the fortified positions of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's army . On May 31 , as Grant 's army once again swung around the right flank of Lee 's army , Union cavalry seized the crossroads of Old Cold Harbor , about 10 miles northeast of the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , holding it against Confederate attacks until the Union infantry arrived . Both Grant and Lee , whose armies had suffered enormous casualties in the Overland Campaign , received reinforcements . On the evening of June 1 , the Union VI Corps and XVIII Corps arrived and assaulted the Confederate works to the west of the crossroads with some success . On June 2 , the remainder of both armies arrived and the Confederates built an elaborate series of fortifications 7 miles long . At dawn on June 3 , three Union corps attacked the Confederate works on the southern end of the line and were easily repulsed with heavy casualties . Attempts to assault the northern end of the line and to resume the assaults on the southern were unsuccessful . Grant said of the battle in his Personal Memoirs , I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made . . No advantage whatever was gained to compensate for the heavy loss we sustained .",
  "/wiki/George_Armstrong_Custer": "George Armstrong Custer ( December 5 , 1839 - June 25 , 1876 ) was a United States Army officer and cavalry commander in the American Civil War and the American Indian Wars . Custer graduated from West Point in 1861 at the bottom of his class , but as the Civil War was just starting , trained officers were in immediate demand . He worked closely with General McClellan and the future General Pleasonton , both of whom recognized his qualities as a cavalry leader , and he was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers at age 23 . Only a few days after his promotion , he fought at Gettysburg , where he commanded the Michigan Cavalry Brigade and despite being outnumbered , defeated J. E. B. Stuart 's attack at what is now known as the East Cavalry Field . In 1864 , Custer served in the Overland Campaign and in Sheridan 's army in the Shenandoah Valley , defeating Jubal Early at Cedar Creek . His division blocked the Army of Northern Virginia 's final retreat and received the first flag of truce from the Confederates , and Custer was present at Robert E. Lee 's surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox . After the war , Custer was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army and was sent west to fight in the Indian Wars . On June 25 , 1876 , while leading the 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana Territory against a coalition of Native American tribes , he was killed along with all of his command during an action later romanticized as Custer 's Last Stand . His dramatic end was as controversial as the rest of his career , and reaction to his life and career remains deeply divided . Custer 's bold leadership in battle is unquestioned , but his legend was partly of his own fabrication through his extensive journalism , and perhaps more through the energetic lobbying of his wife Libbie Custer throughout her long widowhood .",
  "/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America": "The Confederate States of America ( CSA or C.S . ) - commonly referred to as the Confederacy - was an unrecognized republic in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865 . The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states - South Carolina , Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas - in the Lower South region of the United States , whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture , particularly cotton , and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves . Convinced that the institution of slavery was threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories , the Confederacy declared its secession in rebellion against the United States , with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War . Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and normal condition . Before Lincoln took office in March , a new Confederate government was established in February 1861 which was considered illegal by the government of the United States . States volunteered militia units , and the new government hastened to form its own Confederate States Army from nothing practically overnight . After the American Civil War began in April , four slave states of the Upper South - Virginia , Arkansas , Tennessee , and North Carolina - also seceded and joined the Confederacy . The Confederacy later accepted Missouri and Kentucky as members , although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces ; Confederate shadow governments attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them . The government of the United States ( the Union ) rejected the claims of secession , considering it illegitimate . The war began April 12 , 1861 , when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter , a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina . No foreign government ever officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country , although Great Britain and France granted it belligerent status , which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Washita": "The Battle of Washita River ( also called Battle of the Washita or the Washita Massacre ) occurred on November 27 , 1868 when Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custers 7th U.S. Cavalry attacked Black Kettles Southern Cheyenne camp on the Washita River ( the present-day Washita Battlefield National Historic Site near Cheyenne , Oklahoma ) . They were the most isolated band of a major winter encampment along the river of numerous Native American tribal bands , totaling thousands of people . But Custer 's forces attacked their village because scouts had followed the trail of a party that had raided white settlers and passed through it . Black Kettle and his people had been at peace and were seeking peace . Custer 's soldiers killed women and children in addition to warriors , although they also took many captive to serve as hostages and human shields . The number of Cheyenne killed in the attack has been disputed since the first reports .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Little_Bighorn": "The Battle of the Little Bighorn , known to the Lakota and other Plains Indians as the Battle of the Greasy Grass and also commonly referred to as Custer 's Last Stand , was an armed engagement between combined forces of the Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho tribes and the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army . The battle , which resulted in the defeat of U.S. forces , was the most significant action of the Great Sioux War of 1876 . It took place on June 25-26 , 1876 , along the Little Bighorn River in the Crow Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana Territory . The fight was an overwhelming victory for the Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho , who were led by several major war leaders , including Crazy Horse and Chief Gall , and had been inspired by the visions of Sitting Bull ( T\u021fat\u021f\u00e1\u014bka \u00cdyotake ) . The U.S. 7th Cavalry , a force of 700 men , suffered a major defeat while under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer ( formerly a brevetted major general during the American Civil War ) . Five of the 7th Cavalry 's twelve companies were annihilated and Custer was killed , as were two of his brothers , a nephew and a brother-in-law . The total U.S. casualty count included 268 dead and 55 severely wounded ( six died later from their wounds ) , :244 including four Crow Indian scouts and at least two Arikara Indian scouts . Public response to the Great Sioux War varied in the immediate aftermath of the battle . Libbie Custer , Custer 's widow , soon worked to burnish her husband 's memory , and during the following decades Custer and his troops came to be considered iconic , even heroic , figures in American history . The battle , and Custer 's actions in particular , have been studied extensively by historians . Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument honors those who fought on both sides ."
