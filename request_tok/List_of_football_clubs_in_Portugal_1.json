By the 11th century , the fishing industry and fertile farmlands were the economic base of a feudal lordship and Varzim was fiercely disputed between the local overlords and the early Portuguese kings , which resulted in the establishment of the present day 's municipality in 1308 and being subjugated to monastic power some years later . P\u00f3voa de Varzim 's importance reemerged with the Age of Discovery due to its shipbuilders and merchants proficiency and wealth , who traded around the globe in complex trade routes . By the 17th century , the fish processing industry rebounded and , some time later , P\u00f3voa became the dominant fishing port in northern Portugal .
